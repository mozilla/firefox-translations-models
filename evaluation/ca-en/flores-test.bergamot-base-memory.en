This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also offers details that fossils normally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the plume of this animal was brown brown on the top with a light or carotenoid background.
The find also offers a glimpse of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cannon, called rachis, but they do have other characteristics of the feathers ◗beards and barbals , researchers deduce that the rachis was surely a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly but to regulate the temperature or to exhibit. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample presents the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, and not down.

Luminosity and rotation are used at the same time to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be compared to magnetic inversions.

The work done has been mainly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects another dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, elections have traditionally been a not-very technological experience: voters are isolated in a cabin and put on one on a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After those responsible verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting sheet.
French electoral law strictly encodes the proceedings.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there is no leftovers at the beginning of the vote and that no other envelopes are added than those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Beyond Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races at the Championship.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained an "Not finished" in the first round. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors finished with the same result.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, finished in tenth position of the group of women sitting, with a combined time of all the laps of 4:41,30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth classified, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's group of sit-ins did not finish their races, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
The substitute General Inspector D K Arya has said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile and her computer." 
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said the defendant appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the impact of the car occurred, no one was injured.
Still, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was rehoused at Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the Sheriff of Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any visual testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice anywhere else in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists appear to be walking down a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of the suspects."
The Crown office, the person in charge of the allegations, has indicated to reporters that it will not make further statements, at least, until the ruling.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders of before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other matters discussed, as it is stated, are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the AP only agrees to accept it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot test had to be closely monitored by the forest guards, while the pilot test was monitored and their effectiveness was evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Association of Sports Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the hunting program Association of the Association of Sports Shooters.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received adequate safety and training training.
Yesterday Martelly took oath to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, within the framework of a package of measures aimed at advancing the country towards a new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of election celebration, some of them planned for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company branded "non-serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's deferral of the report "frankly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office has said no harm to the nation has been reported.
Likewise, the Pacific tsunami warning center indicated that there had been no tsunami signaling.
A former Philippine policeman has held Hong Kong's hostage tourists to hijack his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and so far the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages have recently been released, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and undertook a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth during her free time.
Their research showed that if a hormone was administered, the baby's fetal lung maturation would be accelerated.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as I...it may be even more...I love her and I'll find her on altar...I hope she's in a better place." 
Of the 1,400 people asked before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic in the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympics had to swim in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three-relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been left in doubt because of his complaints.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to withstand his pains because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water sent to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since some comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize the marriage of same-sex couples.
He branded the rumors "political chatter and foolishness."
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike the old ground-based radar-based technology for traffic controllers to locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
The reinforcement of transport and surface trains will not be contemplated in Wembley; at street level there are no parking for cars or liaison car parks.
The concern of a lack of transport has led us to think about the possibility that the game should be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian islands of Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that much more time was needed for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin finch, strong (endemic) Geospiza, and a conical-picked Galapagos, Geospiza conirostris (fora).
Gold can be worked on in all kinds of forms. It can be molded into small figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. You can hit or flatten it on sheets.
It can be very fine and stacked on other metals. It can be done so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using Lombard cabbage juice.
Lombard cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) is a substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (PH H) in the substance analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed by electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected a sophisticated wastewater system.
Sewerage remains have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met in joint company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it again, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our view.
A giant rocket is needed higher than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most outstanding fact that the wheel has made for us has been to make transport much faster and simpler.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called flocks.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males related along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually intimately related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks behave largely like kitches or wolve flocks, which are animals with a behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (although not that of other large cats) and equally deadly for their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is of the same group (panther genus) of lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-weap roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase called of anger words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals he hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals that eat (taken) with the smell, sniffing the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the atmosphere and then shut down on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main and original group (e.g., crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrate to a new island and cannot go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed in the least, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., that we expire).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had more than seventy sharp teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional game in the sky of the mouth, so there was no escape route for anything that stood in their way.
We don't know it entirely true, but it may have had a forked language. Their diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and rodents called lirons.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they could get paid together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that has arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tried a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only priests could access.
Sometimes special pyramids were built in the form of a tower, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life passed outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters that looked at the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red went into exile from Iceland due to a murder and, when traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it his name.
However, despite its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence a treasure map has been written.
Now, that's not true. Although there is something written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Declaration of Original Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long scroll (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to store it.
Thus, it seems that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-day landings and the battles that came next liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" France. These were French people who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the French free forces had liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, with the meaning of city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
The city-states preceded the nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress was their only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there were no executives or national courts, it fell on the authorities of the state, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all their acts.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so slightly that their representatives often absent themselves.
Italy's national football team, with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The best known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are those of winter, and have the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making this country the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelia"
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors in passing coined for the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeast Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and resorted to Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the era of analog films.
It is still produced today, but even more important: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of the sensors of digital image cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a little confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is said that the aspect relation of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer relation) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been too used and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period, European history was called into question by the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money meant that many people were asked if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting the vital supplies of military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Brittany undermined international waters to prevent any ships from entering full ocean segments, even endangering neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss in the last job he had) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Also among each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the era of the 3 Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods fierce wars took place among many of the nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people were killed fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Equally after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all the men who requested it, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This applies also to the military, because instead of basing the states of the army in classes, from that moment on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class of other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad became deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a fairly clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of 1 of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing its existence, it is not easy to find. The isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
Nothing can be seen except a serene and beautiful sky above the head, and the abundant mountains around it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the Dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which, the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were erected in honor of the wives and members of the family of the Pharaoh.
The "arc up" sign resembles the letter V (comes low) and the "arc down" looks like a staple or square without the lower side. 
When it appears upward it means that you have to start at the tip and push the arch in an ascending direction, and when it is down it means that you have to start with the heel (which is where the hand holds the arch) and stretch the arch in a downward direction.
Rubbing the strings from right to left generates a softer sound, while doing it in reverse produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of scoring your own indications, but keep in mind that arch marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, her two young children (Maria Teresa 11 years old and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and oled threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to carry the windows of the carriage completely open.
At a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a murdered royal guard in Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, in order to cover much of the expenses and interest of the floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street bank houses.
Of course, the large gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, we must understand the context that promoted the creation of order.
The time when events took place is popularly known as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention was completed around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned. 
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a country-wide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of mass cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time there were customs and cultures related to that geography that were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status diminished during the twelveth century, especially since the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silks and spices that had more value than those that the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its maximum popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and due to the slowness of the communication channels, the styles could reach the west 25 to 30 years of delay.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to swamp clothes.
Livelihood is the one that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses native guarded seeds of the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and still so in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with like-minded ideas who feel abandoned by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others have supposedly been raised by animals; of some they are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, presents behaviors (always within physical limits) almost completely equal to those of the animal that breeds it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a method of learning, but a help that provides support to individuals who undergo a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small assistant clip of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to get away with it alone.
Children are given in foster care for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, through extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where he is not fed, loved and polite, but there are those who do.
We believe that the family reception system is a form of security for these children.
Our host system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The reception is supposed to confer all the needs that were not covered in the house from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication than interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995). 
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the audience's reaction to websites. 
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected if a person lies by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are not able to understand speech because of brain damage but are still able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these human behavior interpretation capabilities could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates it from the whole of the heritage of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the variation forward and backward between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
In addition, not achieving this has serious consequences: decay of growth, malnutrition and finally death.
The easiest plant resources to achieve would have been the proteins that provide us with leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest by primates like us humans.
On the other hand, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised by the fact that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" just as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of getting up at sunset during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep again after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a little noisy alarm clock that makes you aware but does not wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who restarts the clock while you sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking many liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, so one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is correlative in the opposite way to the amount of tension in body and spirit of oneself.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can get to the lighting. The only thing that stands in this way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they spread along the path of the love of the Mahayana and by many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the lighting awareness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enmity.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
It lasted forty years and was fought in earnest, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defenses had already been penetrated and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete throughout the night, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland by violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, it interferes with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most important recent examples was the North Atlantic World War II campaign. The Americans attempted to displace men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Contemporaryly, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to tame them to easily dispose of milk, hair, flesh and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed in hills or other grazing areas, often guarded by shepherds who used to be children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England around the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they pulled from the wagons with horses to reach greater speeds and tighten larger loads in the most difficult parts.
The crossings were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on them.
This became common practice, but iron further worn the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning man standing).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecs, did not walk upright on a regular basis.
Bipedal specializations have been found in austrolpitheque fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropists may have walked on 2 legs at most 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partly reduce the suffering that could exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have grown due to the excess population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson to John Dunlap's printing house located a few streets away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
He sent one to George Washington on July 6, who had her read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that it is still alive. We call it birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus would.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, depending on computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are general enough, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Find instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the reduvids and the bed bugs are nidicultural, adapted to see in the nest or house of their guest.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not the best for their interests or their child's superior interests.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, birthparents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most of the scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Just as the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production using biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the virus protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are cells in the germline.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural villages to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, in some way, is connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science today shows us that this huge coal economy has disjointed one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate this type of complaint, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because you cannot predict the driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers usually behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relations have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help the planning, design and operations of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to flee enemies more easily and to find food and partner more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of bending their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places where predators can be hidden.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold the wings are the spieddimonis and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were people who thought what he was saying was true, but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, or is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It transports 8 times more water than the second largest river transports.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water coming out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued to the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the period of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It has knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, while all of them can be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were land, water, air and fire.
It more resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although, according to their theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
One may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms would fit within the end point of this prayer.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to minor status and uses.
At present, messages are written on computer screens, without ever needing a sharpening.
One can only ask what the keyboard will become when something newer arises.
The fission pump works with the principle that energy is needed to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy road uphill. Separating the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break with a small or zero collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so mature towards adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment they will do or not do certain things.
Two theories of famous content are the Theory of the Hierarchy of Human Needs of Maslow and the Theory of the Two Factors of Hertzberg.
Usually, two behaviors may appear so administrators start leading their previous colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to follow as "one more boy" (or girl). 
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends in fights between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual equipment is subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional equipment, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group usually function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, since their teams can meet according to different time zones that the local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team. 
The "invisible team" is the administrator team to which each of the members is addressed. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives to put organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can surface when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the need of the client.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it reduces the area of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior endorses the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of damage, trauma, injury and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies behavior, learning and intelligent machine adaptation.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that need intelligent behavior.
Examples are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to the client's diagnoses and questions as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been built on various domestic computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any kind. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the site is updated, but old versions are kept online as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students usually start their experience of blogging with a neglected grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "oblige students to be more cunning with the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be ready and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of which others write and also make their own perspectives in concrete topics actively respond to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and features a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and the north houses the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as a Canadian city par excellence.
The population of the large northern tracts is rather scarce, and some areas are almost uninhabited wild lands.
To make a population comparison that is usually surprising: there are more African-Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on the beach.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and undertook a great road in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe Route in India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler says that she is married, regardless of the true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not seem very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they would consider harassment, and it is not infrequent to be persecuted, caught by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century ANE, and Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerins used it as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, whose name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trade bases.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina we can easily find places to sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather objects, narguils, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the status of fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use wedding-wedding (moped taxis) to move around Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands. 
Today, Tombouctou is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of World Heritage Sites that are in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special "Wonders of the African World" program for PBS.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park is located in Northeast South Africa and runs along the border from Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each witnessing diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa, or to all National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up Hong Kong's urban silhouette has been linked to a brilliant bar chart that is evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side of the Kowloon promenade.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land gained at sea along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps  but include some of the last remaining stops of the powerful jungles that at some point had covered the gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered with water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that in the area there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis.
Buses leave the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around nearby, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a strayed bridge. It stretches along the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges from the Oyapock to French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The open space vertically under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazil's customs are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now Eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the groups of native indigenous people.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
You can also see tournaments and smaller matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo games, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the pound of the Falklands (FKP), with a value established equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged on the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outlying islands, although they may accept British and U.S. currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falklands outside the islands, so you have to leave.
Because Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the sensation cooler than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be given food or bothered.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bones and wolves and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bones and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having left a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bones and other wild animals, therefore, avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. In addition, almost 200 lives of Americans and Germans were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is on horseback from two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay, to the north, to Devonport, to the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes full family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The best known local beer is the "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
Many French wines can be taken there, but wines from New Zealand and Australia do not quite tolerate travel.
It's all safe to drink local tap water, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of cut is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Melted chocolate reaches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year there are many trips to the reef and there are rare injuries due to any of these causes.
However, it follows the recommendations of the authorities, respects all the signs and pays close attention to the safety warnings.
The cubozoa are located near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can also be found outside these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and they are far away.
Marine crocodiles do not make active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camps, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation or even packages combined with flight and hotel.
They can also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp right there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to get there early to get a place to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play until well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include a time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the time and money their visitors leave behind. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good "gamblers" know that it is important to stay sober. 
Whoever leads to high latitudes or between mountains should consider the possibility that there is snow, ice or very low temperatures.
The friction is low on the icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive there as if you were on the bare asphalt.
During snowstorms a sufficient amount of snow can fall so that you are trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow falling or being displaced by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular use refers to the journey on land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good views.
Animals such as lions, cheetahs and leopards are occasionally shy, and that is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "rural walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, for hosting the games in 1964.
If you made the reservation for the flights and the accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend in July 2020, when the Olympic Games were to be held.
Most of the tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket for about ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry it. In many hotels you can order an iron and an ironing board, even if there is none in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to wear the ironed socks, then you can try to use a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to heat up in excess (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, socarrar).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, the water is enough to boil for a minute; in others it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of worries you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow stretches and closed curves predominate.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than those of other previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although it is curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and that of Bavaria is very and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Pasta with fruit are common, with apples cooked inside the pastas all year round and cherries and plums that appear in summer.
Many German products made in the oven also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most well-known cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small pastas, but full of flavor, taste what according to the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other qualifiers, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is easy to find everywhere in the archipelago and offers a wide variety of seasoned dishes in a simple way. The favorite flavors of Javanese are usually those of peanuts, chilli peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider hanging from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet could get caught.
If a rider throws himself from the horse but has a foot stuck to the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse flees running. In order to minimize this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, most riders carry riding boots with a heel and a thin and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly the English, have safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to fall from the mount if a rider pulls it back when falling.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also called the Yosemite of South America, features many large granite walls and cliffs.
There are stunning views from the peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world continuously establish new routes between their endless extension of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding downhill snow-covered slopes with skis or a surfboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan entire holidays around skiing to a particular place.
The concept of skiing is very old  there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Traveling with a backpack on skis: this activity is also called rural skiing, ski tourism or ski hiking.
It is related to it, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on blonde terrain and requiring skis and boots much more rigid.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good condition, you can travel distances a little longer than walking - although on few occasions you will get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flattened slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this regard.
While you are staying in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to pass passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa does not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiquities. Some tax agencies determine that assets over 100 years old are antiquities.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Craft products can be catalogued as antiquities, although they are more recent than other similar items produced en masse.
Reindeer livestock is an important means of subsistence between the Sámi and the culture surrounding the marketing is also important for many with other trades.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sámi have been related to large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, having reindeer mostly as shooting animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive due to its link with negative stereotypes and with inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a traffic alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may be interested in hearing the recommendations of governments other than yours, but their recommendations are designed for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East could be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Councils are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The considerations presented are usually brief, general and too simplified compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruptions or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur around the world, and there are different classes that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather events, such as storms, tornadoes, water hoses and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe atmospheric phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers be aware of any adverse time risk affecting their area as it could alter their travel plans.
Whoever intends to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely offer the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the problems that have been dealt with here in better detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last 2 to 5 days and include role-playing games, many first aid games and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in nature are frequent, but there are few publications that treat war zones.
Travelers planning to have sex change surgery in another country must make sure to bring valid documents for the return trip.
The availability of governments to issue passports where sex (X) or updated documents are not specified to show the desired name or gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents may vary widely.
The records at the security checkpoints have also become longer invasive in the post-September 11 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not be expected to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Hangover currents are the flow that returns after waves collide with the beach, often at a reef or the like.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper seasons, and a strong current can form into deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the way, swimming backwards is not more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you are not captured again or, depending on your skills or if you have been informed, you may want to wait for a rescue.
The return shock comes before the cultural shock (with a minor honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have been easy to adapt to the new culture are often particularly difficult to adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after having lived abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one does not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and silent before the show begins.
The sounds of tourists and vendors are generally heard. The story of sound and light is quite a story.
The Sphinx is established as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes of the story are shown on the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have the majority of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano confers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m from Mount Vinson.
In distant locations and without telephone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, since it is necessary to find outside with a clear visibility line to make a phone call.
The service is usually used in boats, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that need data and remote voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular choice among people who pose a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with students who have not finished their studies, giving them the possibility to take a year before starting university, without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a year-on-sabbatical course abroad can often improve the chances of starting higher education back in your country.
There will typically be registration fees to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos. 
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sports sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is equated by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is equally quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruise ships make a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of whole days returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you do not need any independent visa (dating 2009).
Some cruise ships show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not for anything near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all environments, in particular if they have not flown before or if they have suffered a traumatic experience.
It is not a cause for shame: there is no difference with the fears and personal apprehensions that many people express towards other things.
For some, having notions about the operation of an aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Courier companies charge well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandising or replacement parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by plane, there are routes where the unloading and passing through customs can take days.
The only way to send it more quickly, was to do it as checked baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger carrying it, and this is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a good bundle of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economic rate for the business class, and up to eleven times in the first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business seats or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of reaching a place quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi?in?u. The language itself is Romanian, but Russian is in common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in the Eastern Moldova, which enjoys its own government and currency, although it does not have the recognition of any member country of the United Nations.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is the Orthodox Christian.
?zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after that of Istanbul, and a very good transport center.
What was once the city of Izmir, is now a modern, developed and crowded shopping centre, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide walks, the buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red roof tiles, the 18th century market and the old mosques and churches, although the city exhales one more atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy the views of the neighbouring island Eysturoy. There is also a very unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church there are some interesting sculptures of doves made of marble on some tombs.
It is worth strolling for half an hour an hour and a half through the interesting village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra, and which became famous to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendours recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus goes to Sintra on a regular basis, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian appearances known around the world.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass cemetery and a place with almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more who had loved ones there who were killed or worked there to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the place by painting or engraving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the official priority language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular messages on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen interruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are reputed to be self-centered, uneducated and arrogant.
While this is usually just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as best you can, act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well educated). This will make it possible for you to move around much simpler.
The sudden appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, with beech, spruce and fir trees, and houses a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It enjoys a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils and various altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of species of animals and birds.
You can find pecular fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the turkey, along with many more common species.
During visits to monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and should also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer covers to women who do not sell prepared, but if you bring yours, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should also wear pants that cover their knees.
This piece can also be ordered at the entrance, but it is clothes that are not washed after each use, so you may find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts. The size is unique!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Bread with oil: bread with olive oil, tomato and any seasoning available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie for you, always start with capital letters, even if they are in the middle of a prayer.
This is a good way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated because it is necessary to discover whether a verb or adjective is used substantively.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be monitored are c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
In addition, make sure to pronounce the r and the rr differently: caro means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these basics about grammar will help you a lot to learn Persian grammar and to better understand its sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know how to speak a little Spanish can hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar to it that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Since light pollution at the time is not a problem like it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those currently built.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an action known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most appreciated.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants present their best appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" specimen. 
If you visit a formally arranged garden and collect any "sample", they will also expel you without contemplation.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe and very easy place to navigate, and you can buy virtually anything after you arrive.
But when standing in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, a traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not only to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic on what to base the holidays on.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to the interesting cities of the Danube or sail through the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for well-known hiking and cycling circuits.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christendom, and the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Also the non-believers of Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have made their own many of the traditions surrounding the festival.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night doing the vigil somewhere in the open to see the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a spring and fertility ritual prior to Christianity.
The most traditional churches often celebrate a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations usually start celebrations at the touch of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling there and this caused the giant turtle to become the first grazing animal of the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will live the polar night, in which the sun does not come out on the horizon.
This gives you a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will remain dark practically all day.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese labor culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
Dresses are the standard clothing of business, and co-workers are called by their family names or by their job titles.
Peace in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing the group's effort rather than congratulating individual successes.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for any decision they take, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without questioning them.
