Bleedi was in a pair of ice skates that now had two sides with a gap between them. These two sides make it hold the ice better, but when it bends to one side.
Because the bottom of the blade is very thin, as the blade moves to one side or the other, the part that touches the fruit will also move.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skate is to the right, the rider is to the right, if the skate is to the left, the rider is to the left.
But if they want to return to the level of their power, they must remove the power they received from the fire.
They do this by emitting tiny particles of light called &quot;photons&quot;.
Scientists call this process &quot;stimulation radiation&quot; because the bright light excites the atoms, which results in the production of photons, but light is also a form of radiation.
The next picture shows where the photons are emitted from these atoms. Actually, the photon is smaller than what you see in this picture.
Photons are smaller than atoms!
