USA Gymnastics stands by the U.S. Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be more appropriately served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the ratio that Larry Nassa survivors so courageously described could have gone unseen for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathery, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid hue in the lower part.
The finding also allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed axis, called rachis, but it does exhibit other feather traits (bristles and barbulae), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that their function was not related to flight, but that they used them to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although it was an eminently theoretical work, the program was written in order to simulate the observations made to the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just like regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is placed around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated "a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of those infected were health workers at the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom he has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of TB patients still appears to be small: 6,000 out of a total of 333,000 individuals infected at a particular time in South Africa.

Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak has led the Indian authorities to adopt measures such as the deployment of pig hunters, the delivery of thousands of mosquito curtains among the population and the use of pesticides in the most affected areas.
Authorities have also secured several million vials of the vaccine to fight encephalitis, which will allow healthcare companies to prepare for next year.
This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and low prioritization, compared to other diseases, have caused delays in the execution of vaccine delivery plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.

During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface and, at night, higher.
"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which typically sustain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the U.S. Geological Survey's archaeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and put a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials corroborate the identity of the person who shows up to vote, he enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law sets procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of those who vote, duly counted and authorized, are added.
Candidates have the power to send representatives to control each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the post of business minister vacated by Davey.
February 16 is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21, respectively, died. The latter was behind the wheel.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed while pointing it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from permanent pain, does not see with one of his eyes, is missing a part of his skull and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as did 36 of the 116 participants of that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she took tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind Austrian first runner-up Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth runner-up Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four seated skiers in the category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants out of 117 of the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the defendants.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the car's impact, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver of the red Audi TT from inside.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, any testimony from an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is common practice in other regions of the UK, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "Journalists appear to be walking on dangerous terrain when they publish photos or other information of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the boundaries in place prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, rangers were required to closely supervise the shooters as they were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited within the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage office, said comprehensive safety training and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in at a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, it is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with malfunctions and excessive heating have been reported, causing six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company labeled as "not serious."
The ministry commented on Apple's reporting delay, saying it was "truly regrettable."
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Marianas indicated that there was no record of damage in the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was gunned down.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and went to work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began her research on preterm birth in her spare time, while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that the baby's fetal lung maturation could be expedited through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She passed away on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Gold Powder Runnels stated, "Luna was as weird as I was; even more. I love her and will miss her. I hope he is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 respondents prior to the 2010 federal election, there has been an 8% growth in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's term ended.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen in Australia.
At one end of the survey are 29% of people who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% who believe they should never do it.
The Olympic gold medal winner was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take medication to relieve pain, because its use in the Games is prohibited.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the finding by using various types of hardware and software and in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, particularly our own, originate, given that comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing people of the same sex to marry.
He called the rumors "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would reduce air route distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and deterrent will not be available.
Due to concerns generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the journal Science released research reporting on the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, although it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migrating cactus finch.  Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and wound into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to a very thin wire that can be twisted and twisted.
It can be made very thin and stick to another metal. Such is the thinness that can be achieved that it used to be used to decorate handmade illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together, and after doing so, with sanitized, wet hands, squeeze them out into a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers, which will feel foreign to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, which were connected with a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since light from Terra's atmosphere distorts some of the light and sight we have.
It takes a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing he has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to it today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are more moderately sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the felines that socialize the most and their lives take place within large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their young.
Usually, females are closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs have the same behavior as those of wolves or dogs, with whom they have a striking similarity (unlike the other big cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, take extensive jumps and pull five times harder than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of emitting roars.
That of the tiger is not a fully sonorous roar like that of the lion, but, rather, like a prayer of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of your prey will be much smaller than yours.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) deviates from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inescapable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (give off).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, it feared nothing, except others of the same species.
Its long jaws had embedded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional group on the roof of the mouth, which means that whatever passed in front of it, there was no escape.
We're not sure, but I could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids and it might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of this food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing in which they differed was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and lying aside while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no major importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; The shops were just counters facing the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; Therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place by then.
While each country separately was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document contains something written, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its back the phrase "original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is unknown for sure who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (measuring 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a callout.
While the D-Day landings, as well as subsequent engagements, had resulted in the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the "Vichy" French, who were a group who, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had secured the liberation of southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people who live and work together are part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, whose meaning is city or city-state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which congress was its sole component.
Congress had no taxing powers, and since there was a national executive or judicial branch, that function rested with state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was it empowered to override tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most practiced sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice jence, skate jence and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago on the globe.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the fifteenth century, when sailors from Europe who sailed through the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan began a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western littoral region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War, (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it cedes the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retains its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored and work continues today.
To exemplify, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimensional ratio of this format (divide by twelve in order to calculate the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS format group) are the same or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing to give a certain order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that is formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone from the monarch to the plebs.
One of the most important tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are set aside for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated international law widely recognized and contemplated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought it would encounter a similar reaction to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent a repeat of the situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a note of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasty.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of The Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same goes for the military, since, instead of basing army charges on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. I used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured over time, very realistically illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally abstracted from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century BC. C., is one of the many structures of pyramidal shape and large size built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were erected in honor of their wives and relatives.
The "arc up" mark resembles a V and the "arc down" mark is similar to a staple or square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow generates a softer sound, while a descending sound is louder and sharper.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the markings on bowed instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Theresa and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and issuing threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to defray most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events are located is usually known as the High Middle Ages, between the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprehends, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also generates a higher incidence in traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and extended to about 1100 AD. C.
During the twelfth century their status declined, mainly because, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given greater value than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was thereafter transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is defined as agriculture whose objective is to produce enough food to meet exclusively the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds originating in the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to illustrate the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are nicknamed "savages." Some feral children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered traumatic situations or serious child abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he exhibits behaviors (within his physical means) almost entirely equal to those of the specific animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; Rather, it is assistance that provides support to those going through a new experience, such as the use of new software or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little animated clipboard of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; But it happens.
We can perceive that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education, and reliable medical assistance.
The objective of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass and people-to-people communication.
The different features of the Internet open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds in length.
Specifically, it is argued that, by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the twentieth century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; The selection one removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one generation and another generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as the human one, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources at its disposal.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should come as no surprise if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption involves intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that makes you return to a conscious state, although without fully awakening you.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on biological rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is related in the opposite way to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force we have. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and bliss.
We can all attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, secularism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unobstructed, chakras activated and awareness of enlightenment developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the US was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by September 17, 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize into the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 fighters of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements.  bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's role has always been to ensure that your country retains the power to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were attempting to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submersibles, tried to nullify this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, meat and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, railway tracks had already been installed by the sixteenth century.
Even though the chariot rails were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and drag heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were lined with iron at the top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with others made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
While traces of standing have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to lead a more planet-friendly life, be part of environmental movements, or we can even become activists and fight to lessen, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not looking only for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to defuse them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few streets away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9. On 10 August another copy arrived in London.
Dunlap's 25 photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. It's the birds.
Many people are not depicted as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly and clawed limbs, lay eggs and move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Their symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be found with an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Killer and bed bugs are nesty; They are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. number nearly 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be in the best interest of them or the child.
These couples might choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The primary goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experimentation, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on classical works; Especially, in the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek language proficiency declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior are often decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustaining and have a period of free cyclic functioning, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they tagged the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have different effects.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including animal and plant wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and study of ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, taking pictures and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and sustains it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and makes use of transport systems; And almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to complaints of such caliber and why failures occur daily? Are transportation engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly graph the circulation flow, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design and operations of road devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold the wings back, sticking them to the sides of the body.
This provides them with a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, Anisoptera and Ephemeroptera are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, including the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth you don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and the second largest on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent derives from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass those of Giza, neither in size nor in the sublime of the technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the smallest population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City ascribe to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, it had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are elements such as calcium and potassium. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively tiny that the end point of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, in the wake of the implementation of new writing methods, the pen is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil sharpener.
It only remains to wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer emerges.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy tank up a hill. By splitting the core once again, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with minimal or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the nearby side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers in this category struggle to make decisions that employees dislike, impose disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to modify everything that the group has been doing so far and do it in his own way.
After all, the ultimate responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional teams handle apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an element unique to virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason might an organization have to undergo the plaintiff process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization's operational departments, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible for the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty leading to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the heyday of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding about mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as facial, handwriting, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, just as it was incorporated into various video game and personal computer software applications.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes hand in hand with technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students tend to be the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them." The need to stoke audience interest inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, in addition to establishing their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries showcasing the country's history and present day.
Niagara Falls lies further south and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the extent that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited lands.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States live more African-Americans than Canadians.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands constitute independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and prevailed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of European influence and colonialism took place in the fifteenth century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking the Cape of Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it does not look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be adamant in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the tenth century BC. C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trifles, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit abroad should be considered in order to take cognizance of the situation of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla watching excursions are among the cheapest in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-wedding (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Timbuktu an image of exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites at risk, product of the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World special on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, since it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which develops a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's top attractions and is recognized as a major icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to park selections in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared with a luminous bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the shore of Kowloon, located in front.
It is on the reclaimed lands of Hong Kong's north coast that its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. So if you want to see evidence of this region's colonial past, it's a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangroves, but possess some of the last remaining trees of the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or marshy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife temple since 1966 and there are currently an estimated 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is by when Brazilian customs controls are expected to end.
The area that now constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for their livelihood.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the sixteenth century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower matches may also be witnessed in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Polo Association you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is set in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It's across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds sterling is usually accepted anywhere within the islands. At Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
Chances are you'll not accept credit cards on the outlying islands, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define the accepted payment method.
It is practically impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30 ° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceiving: While it's very rare for temperatures to be below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make you feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; The amount of rainfall stays almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or hindered.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, it should be kept at least 100 yards / meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards / meters from other wild animals.
No matter how tame they may look, the truth is that bisons, uapatíes, moose, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; Therefore, respect your space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and maintain cleanliness at camp.
Capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for one British cruiser. About two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district on the Pacific Ocean are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shady spots.
Waitemataas Harbour is home to the beaches of Tamaki Drive in the quirky neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are familiar beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the subject. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better to transport.
Local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but if you're concerned, you'll be able to easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee foreign. A black small coffee is called an espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam), and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay special attention to safety alerts.
The cubomedusae are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be found outside this era.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Its primary habitat is estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance of your trip gives you peace of mind that you'll have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also save your reservation in case you need time to think through the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as visa).
However, any modifications or requests must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those attending music events choose to camp on site and most spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll need to arrive early at camp to grab a spot near the musical events.
Keep in mind that, while musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue until the wee hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, intended for family groups with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check where the cabin is located, since crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During St. Petersburg cruises you also spend time in the city. Disembarkers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Normally, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be hard to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions in order to keep guests in good spirits and on the premises.
Some properties serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive at high latitudes or mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms such an amount of snow can fall that it leaves you trapped in a very short time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and standard equipment will make a good view possible.
Occasionally, lions, cheetahs and leopards can be shy, so you will have more opportunity to observe them using binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called "walking through the bushes", "hiking safari" or "hiking") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.

Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help dry them out. Many hotels have an iron and a board to lend to travelers, even if one is not in the room.
If you do not have an iron available, or if you do not want to use ironed stockings, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Try not to let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods of purifying water are known, some of which more effectively target specific threats.
In some, places it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, several more are necessary.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
It can happen that travelers encounter animal pests that are not known in the regions where they come from.
Pests are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, alone, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their strength, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping provides an opportunity to purchase, in certain locations, products exempt from duties and excise duties.
Travelers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving conditions and often travels secluded and lonely terrain.
If you don't usually drive on country roads, stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and hairpin bends.
The established speed limits are notoriously lower than on the previous and following sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
Interestingly, though, cell phone signals are much better here than on many other sections of the highway like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with cooked apples inside throughout the year and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.

The stirrups are the riders' foot supports that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety issues, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse, but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal flees. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety precautions.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with cleats that have a ready and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mounts, especially the English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a rider who is fired pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite crags.

Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular disciplines that consist of sliding on skis or a board fixed to the feet, over snowy terrain.
Skiing is a main travel activity with many followers, sometimes called "ski lovers", who organize their holidays entirely based on skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the seventeenth century. In 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: also known as rural skiing, cross-country skiing or ski hiking.
Although they link, in general it does not involve cross-country skiing or mountaineering of alpine style, developed on steep slopes and with skis and footwear much more rigid.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, you will be able to travel slightly longer distances than if you do it on foot, but very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack of good weight on conditioned slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, whenever you move within this region you can cross borders without going through a passport control post again.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the member countries of this area separately. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion for determining when a manufactured good can be considered an antiquity. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be narrower in places like North America than in Europe.
It may happen that handmade products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.
Reindeer husbandry is a fundamental livelihood among the Lapps and the culture associated with this commercial activity is important for many engaged in other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all Lapps have been dedicated to reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer, mainly, as traction animals.
Today, many Lapps work in modern business activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Return currents are the receding flow of waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow gathers in certain deeper areas and there can originate a fast current in the direction of deep water.

As soon as you manage to escape the current, swimming back will not be more complex than usual.

The impact of returning home occurs earlier than the cultural one (there is no "honeymoon" bliss period), it takes longer to leave, and it can be harder.
Travelers who found it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after residing abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.

In the northern sector, Sentinel Range, are the highest peaks in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote places, where cell phone coverage does not reach, a satellite device may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be equated to a mobile phone, because, to make a call, you must be outdoors and with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is typically used in water transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can check with your local telephone service provider for more information on how to join this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning to take a gap year.
This is very popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.

Typically, a tuition fee will be charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not always required in archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, taking that out, it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises that run across the Baltic Sea include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility to make a visit to the historic city for a few whole days during your return trip, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark during excursions on board, it is not necessary to have a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. However, as can be seen on the map above, this city is not near the sea and your visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can create fear in people of any age and place, especially if they have never been through the experience or if they have lived through a traumatic situation.
You should not feel ashamed about it: it is nothing different from other types of personal fears and dislikes that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little how planes operate and what happens during a flight can make it easier to leave behind a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a sense of not being in control.
Courier companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made a shipment by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to unload and customs.
The only option to do it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit the carriage of baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better to say, to make your company pay for you).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can pay up to four times the economy fare in business class and up to eleven times the economy class in business class.
It's usually foolish to look for discounts for first or business class seats on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and get paid accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
