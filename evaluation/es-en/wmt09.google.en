The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the morning&#39;s rapid decline, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Trading in ČEZ shares reached about half the value of what they are on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the start of trading Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday&#39;s decline when it fell to roughly 6%.
The drop this time is due to falling stocks on Wall Street.
The market&#39;s reaction to the result of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector is also expressed here.
Stocks drop in Asia
The shares of the Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day marked almost 4 percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5 percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the secretary of the Index fell to 3.6 percent.
&quot;The bailout actions scheduled in the US are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,&quot; said the Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong&#39;s interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns) should be allocated.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush&#39;s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly 7 percent. A similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly&#39;s proposal was not going ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: The US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Their vote will take place early next week.
American legislators caused a breach in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not won yet.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and it is voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, a vote on the plan could take place in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Later, however, &quot;disenchantment&quot; will be reached thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
&quot;We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent opinions regarding the form the package of measures for market stabilization should take,&quot; Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told the Bloomberg agency.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a final shape to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the cleanup plan, but I think we are already on it,&quot; Paulson said.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis expressly affects the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get a deal definitively approved by Congress this Sunday.
With this they want to reassure the investors&#39; business before the Asian financial market since these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday&#39;s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two houses of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not deadlock at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount destined to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is not doing its job, which would be another $100 billion and then the last $350 billion. Dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was maintained, which consisted of gaining financial resources to repurchase bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages.
&quot;We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be ready to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,&quot; said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday&#39;s progress and that he appreciates &quot;the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Limitation of the gold-plated contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said lawmakers have decided on the responsibility of the money from the program to protect taxpayers from their losses, a relieving closure to the scheduled finance plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachute contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control over the Fund.
This would have to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
&quot;We&#39;ve worked very hard on it, and we&#39;ve made great strides toward a deal that will work and that will be effective for the marketplace and for all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to lower the debtors&#39; monthly installment burdens and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea to be realized but quite difficult.
&quot;And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government,&quot; Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, all that relevant.
&quot;Much more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that that approval is reached is, at the moment, the most important thing,&quot; insisted Marek.
Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The anticipated elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People&#39;s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the Carinthian state government, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006. .
Worse still has finished the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the war and especially for the popular ones that called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters chastised them for letting the government founder.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party&#39;s presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously pave the way for the constant and closest starting point for the electoral results, that is, for the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the strengthening of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that The same thing happened in 1999 when the popular groups negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it broke up from the BZO) for a coalition government that led to a sanction by the European Union.
Haider is clearly committed to this evolution and has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
Also the Green Party has managed to reach the parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Armed combat: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player manages to make calls.
What seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Even so, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice practically depends on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to buy the latest record player to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records of art rock, jazz or blues music are crowding your shelves, you are probably dreaming of at least this type of turntable.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty-crown market headphones.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even what most mobile phones don&#39;t.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Compared to the most basic functions such as making calls, sending messages, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better or worse photography device and it can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA they will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to cook a barbecue and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the sooner the indicator on the screen will light up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few are the mobiles that manage to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simpler ones) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of that, you constantly call, get yourself, for more security, a charger for work - this also applies to the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player you won&#39;t have this problem, because even the worst ones can last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after charging.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, furthermore, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some non-reducing drives can the small memory cards used in mobile phones be connected.
In the players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
It is enough to fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the artist, album title, genre or also according to the user&#39;s rating.
Some devices only display a directory tree structure similar to Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with OS).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows better
When choosing a specific piece of equipment, take an interest in the battery resistance, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of handling.
If you mainly listen to music in the background and you are going to listen to it only for a while every day, like on the tram, then any mobile phone that reproduces it will suffice.
What practically any mobile truly achieves.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player reproduces the music.
MP3 is reproduced by everyone and, practically, almost all the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it, the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The minuses include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the internet of the mobile to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could be by itself a compelling argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the operators&#39; offer is miserable and most of them are limited only to the fleeting hits on the radio.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a mobile with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you&#39;ll find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it still depends if you always carry headphones with you or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that almost every mobile has even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many music phones will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, like phones equipped with a 3.5mm input. for a classic headset, they cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing other than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record player is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, a gigantic bill for data downloads.
Which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are normally only equipped with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding music lovers, take hold of the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost identical use as a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned above brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already going to arrive, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all services like their Western European partners.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won&#39;t be long in coming.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is probably reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators sending SMS from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to lament that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has already stated that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find a frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile telephony market brought a notable drop in prices to which the classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is a place for this type of operators and that they can be successful.
For the rest, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Just after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators lies in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
Furthermore, in order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer clients than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages, which, however, is often offset by offering more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, the commitment to a non-trivial target group can also be a good blow.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
&quot;The right man chooses Mobilking - it&#39;s the operator you like and trust,&quot; says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like the one in Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small to access the segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated&quot;
In the Czech Republic there are no chances, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not look too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,&quot; Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told mobil.cz in a telephone conversation.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a mobile virtual operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition for Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
&quot;We have a great interest in it, to be able to offer our clients not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly encountered this possibility with all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in the meetings,&quot; said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So perhaps better times are flashing.
It seems that, due to unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
&quot;At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field,&quot; Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2&#39;s opinion, adds: &quot;Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to be developed.&quot;
And he adds: &quot;In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have a specific contract on the table that would be possible to study in such a short horizon&quot;
Vodafone directs its attention rather to compliance with the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We precisely consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet.&quot;
Responsible offices - with the operators hand in glove
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to lower prices and with it, lower profits.
So why facilitate entry to the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are capable of pulling the same rope, proof of this is the grab when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is confirmed by the public information accessible on the ČTÚ web pages.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: &quot;In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to a fourth operator.
As far as the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would place great demands on it and, above all, on its services.&quot;
This is why this access to mobile operators is extremely discouraging due to the utter disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not only the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue.
&quot;The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement was closed on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator.
Until today, no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential interested parties was rather not interesting enough for the classic operators&quot;, added Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS Department of Foreign Relations, to our question.
These statements formulated do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than just a consideration, apart from that they must ensure that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators function normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services&quot;
Obviously, the pressure regarding the correct functioning of the market means and the drop in prices are not within the interest of the ÚOHS.
What is really dramatically shocking in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
&quot;The Office in this sense has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility in their actions in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are the telecommunications regulators,&quot; Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Obviously there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by the ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial bidding a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge, the agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for ÚOHS the fact that three mobile operators are rising remarkably in a similar way should represent a warning.
The current complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they run up against many similar impediments.
Placing the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a short time ago a new amendment to the telecommunications law was presented for the extension of the ČTÚ&#39;s competence in the field of commercial tenders, which was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of ÚOHS should be fully aware of this, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything goes well, when no one is looking
At the same time, it inadvertently continues to function as a pseudo-virtual operator, of which there are already quite a few in the Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that set their own prices for mobile phone services which, however, only part of them are public.
Normally these are companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit this type of resale.
&quot;If cases such as the ones you cite were discovered, one could speak of a violation of the contract conditions that could lead to the end of the collaboration with the given company&quot;, answered Martina Kemrová when asked about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that such activity by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make not inconsiderable profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of possible problems: &quot;The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that the SIM card of their telephone is not in their name, so they cannot absolutely have it as a normal client of the operators.&quot;
This is precisely what should seem to the ČTÚ minimally strange.
In addition, a new question for the ÚOHS appears.
If mobile phone operators squint in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want to, it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it. allow.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile telephony market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in practically all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at this time the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but rather their customers.
Either through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to bring about the first virtual operator and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case like a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let&#39;s not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators allows a virtual mobile phone operator to enter, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
choose the best
Listen to all four performances of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home, on the occasion of the official Czech celebration day.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theater orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one for a male voice and another for a female voice, another with Choir and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of singing.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio already said before that it intentionally chose for the solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
&quot;From the beginning I have tried with both of them and later, also, with the Choir that they pay attention to the diction so that the text is well understood, so that it has consonance&quot;, he commented.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged to music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people embraced it.
The first verse of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the rise of the independent Czech Republic.
How the &quot;new&quot; anthem sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company is written as the date when the first passengers entered the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a ticket. of paper.
This can be purchased right now by almost one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual pass (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously charge it to their chip card at the infocenters and posts of the transport company in the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Vouchers can already be bought since yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket booths in subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
&quot;In these places there is a window with trained personnel available to passengers who help those interested with the purchase online and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card,&quot; said the spokesman for the project, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic voucher on the Opencard in the automatic vending machines found in some subway lobbies.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, reminiscent of a ticket-slicing machine, and travelers have probably already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
It is enough to insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only to it.
Electronic vouchers from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of the central Bohemian towns.
&quot;In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are conductors equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher&quot;, thus explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of public transport in Prague.
The ring buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver&#39;s ticket office.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver, but it is also necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place designated for it on the Cashier&#39;s side.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
&quot;If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,&quot; Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the screen of the machine, they will be shown the information about the validity of their document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It was with this wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans presumably turned to the US president in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a private archive and that today are kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the &quot;Šumava land&quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators&quot; is written in the letter, signed with &quot;the people who bear the fate of Šumava in your heart&quot;.
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South-East Germans presumably supposes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, inconsideration, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president to take office for today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate.
&quot;We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, he would hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies,&quot; the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the US president presumably doubts this idea of the šumavian Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the šumavian lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with our current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a bit childish to us, according to some specialists it accurately depicts the expectations of the South-East Germans of that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have sensed that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they will stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When he was seized by the British at the end of the war and placed in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to be taught Czech.
&quot;They thought that when they came home, the Czech would come in handy,&quot; Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war counted on the fact that they would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at safety on the roads.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous behaviors behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, internet and in brochures.
It would have to discourage the driver from high speed and drink driving.
And also to remind them to fasten their seatbelts before setting off.
He wants to reach the conscience above all of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and last but not least of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that attack emotions.
And the &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; ads throughout the campaign attest to this:
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
The word &quot;You don&#39;t think&quot; is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word &quot;you pay.&quot;
This must symbolize that the man in a moment of confusion can end up paying with his own life.
The ads will &quot;scare&quot; viewers through the year 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
He promises that in this way he will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
&quot;For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he runs a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks,&quot; says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is necessary in the press and mainly negative publicity, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
&quot;If there is a panel installed warning of some danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it,&quot; Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
&quot;We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must necessarily return almost all the (occupied) land if not all,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.
&quot;Surely we will keep a certain percentage of this land, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel&#39;s land) because without this there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
&quot;Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over their legs like one of my best friends did, then they will have to give up a part of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert said, referring to the two. July attacks in the city in which several were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find &quot;a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place&quot; that is located inside the ancient city.
&quot;Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won&#39;t work,&quot; he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,&quot; he warned.
&quot;The Syrians know very well what they will have to part with to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement), they will have to get rid of the permanent support that terrorism provokes from Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq&quot;, specified the prime minister.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool down
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
&quot;If this is not resolved, then yes, then yes, this cooling off would surely come to pass,&quot; he stated after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal affairs it is difficult for the executive to interfere.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the Darjiling local government in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
&quot;Your problem could be solved,&quot; the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best thing would be, according to Mukherjee, if he appealed to the highest instances.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait in freedom for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
&quot;He advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible,&quot; said the Head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person &quot;competent legal support,&quot; the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such kind of support is already obtained by the Indian side.
&quot;We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that too,&quot; Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
&quot;We really consider it a gross mistake to imprison and sentence these Czech scientists,&quot; he announced.
The minister evaded answering the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would take care of the matter.
&quot;I have received quite a few promises&quot;, he only stated.
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can&#39;t walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the hostesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
&quot;If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the flight attendant&#39;s activity is against the road traffic law,&quot; says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week was evidently caused by the truck driver, except that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the vehicle despite having reserved two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident or suddenly brake, and at the precise moment when the stewardess distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what plays a role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with places for walking.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The Student Agency&#39;s long-distance buses do not have standing places, which company director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally they withdrew this and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,&quot; he told us about his position.
The stewardess does not know the law
&quot;There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the flight attendant - no legal provision clarifies this role.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined, &quot;adds, less emphatically, the spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have places on foot.
That&#39;s all,&quot; he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with a higher speed permit, and long-distance non-standing room buses with the highest permit. of speed and with the seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP Transport Safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see major problems regarding the movement of the stewardess on the bus.
&quot;During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on airplanes.
Not even here is there the certainty that turbulence will arrive and that the stewardess could hit her head.&quot;
&quot;However, if the bus stops suddenly, obviously the laws of physics are valid.
The same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the flight attendant must be solved by the carrier&#39;s internal regulations,&quot; he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the hostess service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
&quot;However, the moment I get the impression that the flight attendant position is risky, then I will abolish it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive you, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,&quot; he says.
It is in the interest of safety that Asiana lacks flight attendants in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a smaller line compared to SA.
&quot;We don&#39;t have flight attendants, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident,&quot; he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident on the line that connects to Naples, a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably swerved from the parking lane, blocking the path of the bus. without using the turn signals.
Its driver tried to avoid it in a quick maneuver, however, he collided with the front right.
Jančura denies that the two places reserved for the flight attendant&#39;s rest were sold.
&quot;These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked.&quot;
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl&#39;s family but expects the financial expenses also by the guilty party.
Law reform?
Not for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision regarding the movement of the stewardess on the bus, in which thirty expert members of a group from the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
&quot;However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They don&#39;t focus too much on buses, but rather on the points system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving,&quot; says the expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers,&quot; spokesman Hanzelka concluded, stating that the control of security on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Security Office at work.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent,&quot; says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes completes it.
Govern this mood and enthusiasm for work.
Until today, the seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also organisms unknown until today that themselves hold the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with coasts have begun today to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally about the so-called Continental Edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, under the Treaty, exclusive rights to all resources on the Continental Rim.
&quot;Simply, by continental edge is understood the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often, up to the border of two hundred nautical miles, that is, a pure economic zone,&quot; explains Mikulka.
The petition that the given country presents to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Border, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation work.
&quot;One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,&quot; adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia&#39;s success had global repercussions as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, so did New Zealand - the seabed area awarded to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, or almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars for its study.
The profit to be derived from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Also other states are gradually submitting their applications.
They can do it up to ten years from the moment they ratified the &quot;Montego Bay Treaty&quot;.
Where the continental edge ends, begins the region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as the &quot;common heritage of mankind.&quot;
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these zones is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
&quot;The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,&quot; director Mikulka says emphatically, adding &quot;that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.&quot;
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called &quot;the pioneer investor&quot;.
It has the power to explode in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
&quot;You can exploit a surface with a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,&quot; adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of precision.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
Dusseldorf&#39;s hope rests on Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its collaborators there is no shortage of great words.
By merging the units of the Düsseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, `a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group&#39; can be formed, as the letter, published on Monday, says.
West LB bank, breaking the `competition bloc&#39; with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for further mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the federal institute for the supervision of financial services, which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been a lot of talk about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse&#39;s clients know for their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, let it be known that he sees no point in merging the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank like for example the Helaba or the West LB.
But DEKA&#39;s board of directors, which is now made up of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just started, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important businessmen on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the bank DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba&#39;s involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began a dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks was always at stake.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the board of directors of Helaba, expressed that he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are about to take place, BayernLB&#39;s union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue fusing increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank may only be a young partner, although it has so far come out of the financial crisis much better than the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far failed to provide an answer.
In the end, West LB can break down, but that, naturally, is not the bank&#39;s own wish.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank&#39;s board of directors it is said that they would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank
How the coexistence between unique parts of the bank can be combined with DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as &quot;the weekend of the Italians&quot;.
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, which is why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, a huge tiger bear is built, which shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds it can produce in its throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they reached Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 11:45 p.m. three buses leave, `towards Munich, the beer festival&#39;, scheduled to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot, next to their flag, the South Americans are singing, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
These buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial fur lining and glasses with silver-colored temples.
They have been coming to the Oktoberfest for five years, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the guide in German - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction &quot;Brennero&quot;
No beer, not yet.
Tranquility quickly reigns on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
It&#39;s okay like this, they will still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registrations make another stop on the highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco&#39;s group is scheduled to arrive at 6:30 in the morning in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already around 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First: put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written &quot;Oktoberfest&quot;, next to it in gothic script is the page of Marco&#39;s travel office on the internet: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second: &quot;When the doors of the tent open, that means march!&quot; Marco shouts at dawn.
&quot;To March!&quot; March and occupy the back seats in the tent.
&quot;Do not take the seats in front, because we are going to block, and all with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, scattered throughout the space!&quot;
A liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don&#39;t forget the tip
Show the security people that we have good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will already be occupied!&quot;
Third: &quot;This afternoon at exactly half past ten you have to get here!&quot; Do you understand?
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on trees, road signs and even on an election poster for a large Bavarian People&#39;s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as &quot;the weekend of the Italians&quot;
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English ( about 60 assists) and the Austrians rank first.
The favorite tent of the campaign of the Italians is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany&#39;s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed just last week.
How nice that the politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and added that the German banking environment will also be affected by critical trends.
And that has happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financier from Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist the turmoil on the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: the credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as those of public law.
The cause of this are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for the long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which is now, due to mistrust in the markets, no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank&#39;s capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital fell a little behind from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continuous income from financial investments and net profit from financial operations fell to zero, the income from imputation for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to the decrease of more than 70 percent, in 5 million euro.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues from the reimbursement of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the business organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could show a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier initially got lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since it was not possible to earn much money with the financing of state projects, Defa began to dedicate itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public- Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an &quot;essential material effect&quot; on the group&#39;s consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends.
Already by the year 2007 they were canceled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became an important state financier and financier in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own customer deposits, it, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, which occurred two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of Defa&#39;s credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the group&#39;s financing needs for a short time and the company is insured from &quot;the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function&quot;
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the Chairman of the Board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
The bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors have to wait for that.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It is even conceivable that you do not have to need the financing in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
Word was spreading that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, which is why temporary salvation cannot reassure even the least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, the rates of loans according to the position in the property registry are clearly trending downward.
Affected are above all the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans, which were previously an investment for speculation, must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it is possible to start with the repayment of pensions within the term.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining- the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the mixed news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That&#39;s going to be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, racking their heads over the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still, short-term investors can put the stoppage and use the write-off of losses for upcoming tax payments indemnifying profits on the exchange in the future.
During the liberation of the hostages, the German special forces command was at the scene of action.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Therefore, specialists from the German army as well as officials from the GSG 9, the aircraft squadron of the federal police, from the Federal Criminal Investigation Office were also at the place of liberation, as well as experts in the field of logistics from the technical charity .
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because hijackers, sensing a violent liberation, let go of their prisoners and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on the spot.
&quot;Fortunately, that time did not come,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the robbers had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile the saved people safe and sound arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;, 5 tourists and the special forces are to return by Airbus of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to perform at Tachibana Highschool on the first day, the girls started laughing: The German girl is totally &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells about Japan.
&quot;The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Even before going to school I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not set as rigorously as at my house in Lower Saxony.
At eight in the morning the students come, at twenty to nine a small meeting with the teachers begins, the &#39;home room&#39;.
Before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Also, I am not a person who speaks with pleasure in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my host family&#39;s mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I went to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: &quot;Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...&quot; - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started to study this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed, and waved, and I&#39;ve heard the word &quot;kawaii&quot; the whole time.
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girl survival vocabulary and means &quot;cute, cute&quot;
Then I quickly slid into my seat.
The girl next to her had a big smile, she was honored that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
They were all talking at the same time, laughing and asking a lot of questions - at the same time it&#39;s very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then at recess everyone got out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it&#39;s something other than boring German pieces of bread.
It had herb rice, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like meat in tofu batter.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and taste new.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a break.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
&quot;Why Japan exactly?&quot; My friends have asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
So I always answered:
&quot;Well, because it fascinates me.&quot;
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still didn&#39;t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.&quot;
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the salvation package
The first chamber of the US Congress barely let a huge $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets fail.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The House of Representatives of the United States rejected with 227 votes against 206 the package of the government to save the financial markets.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program that should limit the disorder in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to take a vote even though the plan is not so popular.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get political approval to prevent something that absolutely hasn&#39;t happened yet,&quot; he admitted.
Already during the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state rescue package might fail.
It was rested late in the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
The experts count on other serious turmoil in the international financial markets.
To let the program into force it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
rats have feelings too
It is said that a rat or a cockroach, feeling danger, flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called &quot;Edge&quot; for many years the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or someone else could not prove so far, although we can&#39;t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we turn to other species and include the questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn&#39;t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it plays dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Naturally I don&#39;t think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness from the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than in other primates, and seems to be entirely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even humans differ from other primates. .
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked with language, this often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, cannot be measured because it has special hardware, nor can it be analyzed through our experiences, then your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions are concerned with the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific investigations.
Consciousness processes in animals could be investigated without taking their contents into account, and that is what happens during studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential goes more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization training.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind we are in when brain activity takes up space in the defense system (or its consequences, such as body reactions).
Seen from this point of view, the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others besides ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, Jaak Pankseep thinks the same, but focuses more on the brainstem. brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can&#39;t go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that is felt in two cases as well: But how can one control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger, a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that similarity of behavior does not yet prove similarity of experience.
It is true that the neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brainstem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don&#39;t know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is concerned with special circuitry and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I don&#39;t see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I&#39;m a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
&quot;The government regards UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as a confident proof of Ukraine&#39;s ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland,&quot; Wasjunik said.
&quot;But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is much to do.&quot;
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can not lose more time.
Now we have to carry out work with great speed,&quot; said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
&quot;UEFA will not take their eyes off us.&quot;
In Poland a more radical step was agreed upon.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is &quot;a serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of following the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
&quot;In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from this.&quot;
Only in the last season many clubs from the first division were sentenced due to manipulation in relegation to the lower category, finally the division council also had to be adjourned.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - including the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened economic situation, the German desire to travel remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) reported in Berlin on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year. .
According to research by the GfK market research institute, bookings for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher than in 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures, which are the analyzed information on reservations in 1,200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected is travel reservations made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in great demand, reported the DRV.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations for Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized tours are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case the travel costs are &quot;better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip&quot;.
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the sales volume compared to last year was up again - although according to another study the number of Germans taking a trip, compared to last year, was down.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, was talking in an interview about private life - and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The late war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failed marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.&quot;
She learned the size of his infidelity only after the divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of private things was Ryan&#39;s work with the press for his new film &quot;The Women&quot; - a story of a failed marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to designating him a cheating husband was clear: This is &quot;unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,&quot; the 54-year-old told the &quot;New York Daily News.&quot; .
Among other things, it is very &quot;unfortunate&quot; that Jack, his 16-year-old son, is again &quot;going to remember in public the pain and the changes, everything that a divorce means for a child.&quot;
While Ryan lives alone after the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently the father of twins.
And so he ends his statements emphasizing: &quot;Be that as it may, my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is doing well.&quot;
Airline ticket and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, plane tickets in Germany became even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel stays have become cheap again - these are the results of a study by the provider of travel services and financial services American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 out of 48 different cities in Europe increased on average by 6.9 percent.
From April to June, prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakening dollar rate, which was the cause of &quot;the interest of American tourists in traveling decreased.&quot;
The decrease in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and thus broke a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the prices of plane tickets also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent. .
From April to June, prices for airline tickets in Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average by 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second semester they dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, the prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The reason for the change in prices is on the one hand the increase in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is declining.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes the traffic of planes between the USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit long-distance flights by airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still hasn&#39;t come out to score the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the crash landing of the national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what had happened, could be read clearly from his lips.
I just knew that I was right.
&quot;We need a second goal,&quot; Hermann Rieger whistled at the booth entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys a very high reputation as one of those who were a part of the group.
That&#39;s why your request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and held up his fingers in assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
&quot;Today was not all pretty to see,&quot; Marcell Jansen added afterwards.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have it &quot;more relaxed&quot;.
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his header; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show their full strength to the weak Hamburg team.
&quot;That was a dirty victory,&quot; summed up Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121 years.
On Saturday, the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of tables on the video screen.
It&#39;s going to be a birthday without a real party.
&quot;We know how to play it,&quot; Marcell Jansen said.
He anticipates that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the fickleness of the league than to the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late obligatory players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalscorer Petric as well as Jansen who was released from FC Bayern need time to come together, but the team still cannot shine with its successes.
&quot;We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,&quot; demands Jol.
my first oktoberfest
Party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, beer in liter mugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don&#39;t really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional Bavarian costume tailored.
I have dark colored hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: as soon as we are in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with photos - it is very flattering especially since I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That&#39;s how it&#39;s done friends.
The cheap Bavarian traditional costume seems to do its job.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from Northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes was still limited to this day.
But after arriving at Prado de Teresa, everything is not that bad.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costume or leather pants; no seems to be ignoring or feeling unpleasant - everything is quite normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a stand of bananas in chocolate.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to my apron, which I was wearing the wrong way: &quot;the left part is single, the middle is the virgin, the right part is engaged, behind is a widow.&quot;
Oh God, now I&#39;m buttoning up the back on the left.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says, laughing.
The others don&#39;t care for many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps that say &quot;To drink to get dressed!&quot; and they show, without asking them, their knotty ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and he is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He sounds &quot;gorgeous&quot; to him, which he pronounces with a very long &quot;o&quot;.
He tells me about it after placing his one-liter glass of beer that he just drank next to it.
He put it directly next to the fire hydrant, most think that&#39;s a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
Around eight o&#39;clock at night the groups of toilets run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered litter from one tent to the other.
That works like with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
It is not seen who suffers the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the litter.
&quot;They are the ones who &quot;can&#39;t take it anymore&quot;, a health worker answered my question and disappeared in a tumult.
After voting defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks&#39; rescue package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the largest one-day point loss in its history.
Then the Dow recovered a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., one of the most important stock market barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
Right now the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The salvation plan foresees making resources available to buy so-called &quot;rotten&quot; mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid all at once, if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive the stock option receipts for the financial associations which during the development of the course can be cashed in order to reduce the financial burden on the state&#39;s treasury.
The courses of actions in Europe and those in the US continue to fall
The aid of billions for the banks in Europe and in the USA does not reassure the investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the financial market salvation projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Losses in speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite rescue actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the share of the Munich real estate financier lost two thirds of its value over a period of time, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
All over the world financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of the day on Wall Street in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government&#39;s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the open, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the salvation project, the vote in the Senate could be on October 1st.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: initially the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the main Japanese Nikkei index after benefits fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor shares lost on the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that the shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity may not be quite so correct.
The space probe &quot;Ulysses&quot; spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel lines are freezing now he is threatened with death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assist is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what has surprised researchers for many years: Missiles don&#39;t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have more or less speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravity assist to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein&#39;s General Theory of Relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter due to the curvature of space, may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
&quot;The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth,&quot; he writes.
Investigators of the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, Dark Matter makes up at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy&#39;s foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudan hijackers had demanded millions from the ransom.
Six hijackers are to be killed in a shootout during the liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations regarding the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention point of the hijackers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE narrates about the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented on this by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of foreign affairs, confirmed the release: &quot;Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
&#39;Now we monitor his state of health,&#39; said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 desert expedition participants are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom,&quot; the guard said.
It was just about &quot;receiving the hostages&quot; when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot;, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died at hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was implicated in the accident which occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather&#39;s abuse &quot;led to suicide&quot;
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in jail after he admitted to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro Royal Court, through an inquest, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper: &quot;I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
The court learned that Ms Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
Following the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the twice-weekly abuse.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some of Ms Rande&#39;s friends had said about her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed &quot;emotionally dead&quot;, as if she had &quot;given up on life. &quot;
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in her Plymouth apartment.
Ms. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter which he concluded by saying: &quot;I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: &quot;You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a dreadful experience, especially when she was only seven years old.
This ugly saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer is that if she hadn&#39;t done it, the matter probably wouldn&#39;t have ended up in court.&quot;
She added: &quot;I have noted the effect that Stephanie&#39;s mother and father have described the abuse had on their daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a bright, successful and happy future.&quot;
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip for the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not carry any indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
&quot;They thought it was an internal matter between the Defense Ministry and the Cabinet,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service said the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Building Societies Face B&amp;B Price
In Britain building societies could face a price tag of over £80k after the bailout of Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in effect, provided £14bn to protect the deposits of the bank&#39;s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the companies that use the savers&#39; money, including the 59 building societies.
The director general of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it &quot;humiliating&quot; that the societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the interim is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that have behaved prudently... are called upon today to pay the price for institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, B.S.A.
This means that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover £81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Societies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
&quot;It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.&quot;
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any partnership since 1945.
&quot;We will need to look at all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members against what could be a relevant price,&quot; Mr Cole added.
Interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to March 1st.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest due, which may be almost twice as much.
Building societies being mutual organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates on their savings.
Türkiye broadens its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey inkted to become a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 paces into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to pierce the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling to all a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit run down.
But once you get past the ticket office to the vault, there is no doubt whatever the greatness of the undertaking was that this was the westernmost gate.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a &quot;latecomer&quot; in the imperial game, had ambitions to dominate the Middle East via this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has been declining and remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey&#39;s willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - some ten and a half hours later - after a jolting journey, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, intended to rule a new state. secular, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
that has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and &quot;power bakeries&quot; where middle-class managers in suits businessmen and women meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I&#39;m sure he still has a Blackberry.
&quot;The party&#39;s foreign policy objective is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,&quot; he tells me.
Türkiye has been severed in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look to the East and West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
&quot;But surely at some point,&quot; I ask, &quot;Turkey might be forced to choose?&quot;
&quot;Turkey,&quot; he replies, &quot;does not want to face that choice.&quot;
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I&#39;ve spoken to up to that point has recited to me almost by heart: Turkey&#39;s relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, They represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically ride those rail lines that open up the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts turn to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had assisted in the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to learn that Europe&#39;s ambitions in the Middle East would, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered &quot;the sick man of Europe.&quot;
So, there are not many doubts as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
The price of milk rises from five pence per liter
Residents of the Jersey estate will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#39;s request for bail, meaning she can be thrown in jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail on charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several accusations of corruption in his charge.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the militarily supported government of the country first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was paroled to go abroad for medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court&#39;s order.
&quot;The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s bail petition on the grounds that she could not get bail because she was already undergoing treatment abroad on probation,&quot; said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We are going to file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.&quot;
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to what an Awami League leader said last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges they are accused of.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the UN - have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polio vaccination campaign because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge at the Competition Commission after the decision forced the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB&#39;s interests hinder competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB&#39;s takeover of ITV&#39;s stake raised doubts about ITV&#39;s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that forcing it to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy, particularly as BSkyB said it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department&#39;s inspector general criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
&quot;Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,&quot; Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the report&#39;s main recommendations was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to give up their statements.
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removed from their posts by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the lawyers had rated themselves no worse than their peers, and many observers concluded that the firings were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked to prosecute Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
and they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure over the layoffs, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General&#39;s report is highly critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, noting how he had &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the firings, that he &quot;abdicated&quot; his leadership position and was &quot;remarkably uncooperative&quot; in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush aide, were criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s epic of much honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at a ceremony in London, said receiving the award would be &quot;an honour.&quot;
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf&#39;s smash album in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running the nominations for this year&#39;s awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: &quot;There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.&quot;
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the chart.
However, Meat Loaf&#39;s Bat Out Of Hell stayed in the charts for about nine years and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - before I found Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little lane, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles more of a dusty alley than a busy thoroughfare.
There are no signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street
that he wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include longtime residents who commented that they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block&#39;s past before the buildings&#39; takeover.
However, the city&#39;s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which controls the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Neighborhood Community Land Use Committee meeting this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to purchase the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain to the city, called for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager for Community No.3.
&quot;The city owns very few spaces today and we would like to see it continue to own Extra Place,&quot; said Ms.
&quot;We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street.&quot;
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as a cafe, in the hope of renting out the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month&#39;s meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn&#39;t necessarily want to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,&quot; he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city&#39;s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency&#39;s mission is property development rather than property management.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those on the Bowery, Extra Place has left its mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land went unclaimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones album &quot;Rocket to Russia.&quot;
&quot;The setting was magnificent,&quot; said Danny Fields, the Ramones&#39; manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
&quot;It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes.&quot;
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public assets, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as an oddball, largely unchanged, a slice of town that should be nurtured.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Vanishing New York (subtitle, &quot;The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct&quot;), has made available part of a talk on the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a somewhat narrow cul-de-sac, dark also by day and punctuated by rusty iron warehouse doors and shutters, with weeks&#39; old newspapers blown along the the gutters.&quot;
With few exceptions, the street looked much the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat wriggled across the back of the street and stood near the door that used to enter CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a wipe down.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
&quot;I spent the best years of my life,&quot; he said, &quot;in dark, damp, and filthy places.&quot;
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates&#39; positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of &quot;Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.&quot;
Effectively appealing to Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama&#39;s campaign notes that &quot;African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama&#39;s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English-learners.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in the classroom, is effective in closing the gap in final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
more than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
Yet a whopping 100 percent of fourth-year students have scored positively on the 2008 math test.
and almost an equally staggering 93 percent have mastered the English language arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than the one favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, the school&#39;s approach to English instruction to students is &quot;total immersion.&quot;
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, &quot;We&#39;ve had extraordinary successes with students like this last one who have come from Mexico and if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you won&#39;t be able to pick up what was .&quot;
&quot;It works,&quot; he pointed out, &quot;we think it works.&quot;
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations to replicate?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the view of his party politicians on the issue of education (the National Educational Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Mr. Obama&#39;s response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, &quot;you should make sure that your child can speak Spanish.&quot;
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider education models that work well, rather than dismiss or trivialize them.
Oil price falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday on concerns that the US bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen from more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before pulling back, yet again, on huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that over the hectic weekend, the negotiations leading up to the bailout deal &quot;appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.&quot;
As the economic situation deteriorates, a drop in demand for basic products, including oil, is expected.
&quot;The outlook for global equity, interest rates and currency rates will become increasingly uncertain,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
&quot;We believe that basic products will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a products perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. &quot;
The bank&#39;s analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year, as oil consumption falls due to the crisis in economic growth and the oil and gas price reduction forecast is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
Having spent more time than anyone else in a Jets uniform playing defense over the past eight seasons, Shaun Ellis thought I&#39;d seen it all.
Then he saw things play out in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a blowout game.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like that,&quot; Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the gloomy clouds.
At this moment it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of these when a cornerback went down and another came with 10 seconds left in the half.
&quot;I didn&#39;t go out of my way,&quot; Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
&quot;He&#39;s a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.&quot;
While Favre and Coles were playing on the dam, the Cardinals defense roughed up quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking jumper and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith punted to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds to spare, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked it from 20 yards to win it 34-0.
It&#39;s the most points the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Asked to describe the madness of this moment, the team&#39;s coach, Eric Mangini, said: &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;
When answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: &quot;I can say that I liked the second quarter a lot better than the third.
They have gained a lot of points in a very short period of time.&quot;
Rested Gebrselassie tops his world record
Once again, Ethiopia&#39;s Haile Gebrselassie has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile 2-hour race. 4 minutes.
After the victory in the easy flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie smashed his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set a world record number 26 in a race of impressive length, setting a world championship or world record for any distance from time trial to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution will exacerbate her asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees to start the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, spending an average of a gritty 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since when track runners like Gebrselassie and Kenya&#39;s Paul Tergat have converted to long distances, the marathon record has been cut by more than two minutes in the past decade, as Brazil&#39;s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06 :05 in 1998.
After last Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Clearly the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
&quot;I am very happy,&quot; Gebrselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well.&quot;
The athlete has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s Afro-Eastern rival - for his style of overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding meeting many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if It was about a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism doesn&#39;t diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie&#39;s skills as a running back.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers slowed.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie picked up one last push to pull away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, bettering his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi made it to third place in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, capped off a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, came as a surprise, winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set a personal best time of nearly five minutes in the third marathon she&#39;s run.
He ran a smart calculated race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners take the lead, then picking them up after 18 ½ miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia took second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and proof of life of color
Hidden by the sprawling Orlando-themed park, a few miles from the bright, noisy, colossal city, lies a sleepy town, where the pride and intricacies of the African-American experience remain all too evident.
Eatonville, the country&#39;s first incorporated all-black city and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;the city of five lakes, three croquet lawns, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a jail.&quot;
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay homage to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stopover by including it in the Federal Writers&#39; Project&#39;s depression-season travel guide to Florida – remains a place apart. .
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida were often resistant to sharing their true ideas with the white man, who &quot;knows so little about us and He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s missing.&quot;
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
&quot;We&#39;re very cautious about the way our story is told,&quot; said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city&#39;s oldest church.
&quot;It has to be correct.&quot;
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of almost 2,400 people who live under a level of poverty twice the national average.
It&#39;s a literary hub, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes scorned, other times praised - that was born out of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville&#39;s image really started with Zora, since no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her insightful dialect books like &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten in black history and human drama.
Concrete-faced in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston led her readers into the store owned by Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and later into more private areas.
&quot;Off the road on the left,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is the modern brown public school with its white trim, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, tended by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.&quot;
She also mentions the Widow Dash&#39;s new husband and writes that Glenn Lee &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms.&quot;
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston links Eatonville to home rule, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Obviously this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
&quot;Zora described it like it was,&quot; said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who went around singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: &quot;Some people didn&#39;t like that.&quot;
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, she did so unannounced in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most of the residents were entranced, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
&quot;People were always so happy to see Zora,&quot; continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, rocking in his chair in a backyard overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Mrs. Hurston was likely baptized, &quot;she never stayed very long.&quot;
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no grand memorial ceremonies, no grand public readings.
&quot;I don&#39;t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the &#39;80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the fight for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
&quot;During that season, a bunch of white kids, they were going around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them,&quot; Mr. Franklin said.
&quot;They also killed a girl, once.
They threw him against a watermelon from the car.&quot;
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;insulted rather than honored my race.&quot;
A Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some ways, had weakened Eatonville&#39;s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
&quot;Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - it was customary to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,&quot; said NY Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization. profit.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t hugging your teacher because he was white - there&#39;s a cultural gap there,&quot; said Ms Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who stepped over prejudice, just as she did, with buoyant confidence and lines like: &quot; How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don&#39;t understand.&quot;
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston&#39;s anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston&#39;s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans turned up for the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its highway proposal.
&quot;The resurrected idea of the five-lane highway would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,&quot; said Ms Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it more simply: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory over the highway project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to the church here in 1993, began showing up in large numbers, and residents began revisiting the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing Hurston&#39;s name, of course) opened in 2006, on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like you&#39;re on a street from the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville&#39;s history, its meaning, are still often treated with caution.
A Advance permission is required for most interviews, and some things - like the murals in Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher with a soft spot for bright red, still fear that their island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, so has a greater level of hometown pride emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to view Eatonville the way Mrs. Hurston viewed her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative , hardworking, silly and mixed.
It&#39;s sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin&#39;s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or with the Police Department, which He said he could use some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people, if they dare to come here, will have to think, &#39;Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,&#39;&quot; says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
&quot;But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it&#39;s a very nice city.&quot;
Around here in New York, everyone talks about finance regularly.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the eye of the storm.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are daily faced with the worst &quot;bad day of the office&quot; since the slump of 1929.
Delivery boys continue to clatter their metal tea carts across the pavements and carry trays of muffins for breakfast gatherings.
Latino men continue to shuffle between loaded apartment buildings, much like human mules, with 50 eccentrically patterned shirts slung to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it&#39;s still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 pm on weekdays.
Employees are still waiting in line for their bagels at the vendors&#39; carts, and it&#39;s still impossible to find a cab between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had timed the operation to coincide with the late-afternoon lull at my local JP Morgan Chase affiliate, a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting.
And not in front of the clerk&#39;s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where longtime customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek directions to the Macy&#39;s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my &quot;trusted personal banker&quot;, and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places they had commuted from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called thrift associations (a bit like a building society), credit unions, and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only operate within the state they belong to, and which they claim to deal with customers as his family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a few deposits Savings of $440 billion, it was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers standing before me, fearing another meltdown, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her stricken-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was discussing the matter familiarly as if complaining about a colleague&#39;s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something uniformed janitor in my apartment block, has changed the course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the grocer.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that &quot;I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I&#39;m not taking any risks.&quot;
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford&#39;s music director since 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It&#39;s supposed to be for the under 21&#39;s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, a number of us were in our late 20&#39;s - we just refused to give through to the chorus.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (the mythological shape-changer) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless if unaccompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man&#39;s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained utterly constant through the years.
Tod often told us to &quot;let the music speak for itself.&quot;
He would say: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
It&#39;s all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!&quot;
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never overbearing or overly flowery.
Whatever the musical weeding, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
if any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades that he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of their concertos and can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any – otherwise I have been inspired by them many times.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply &quot;sold one or two well-known warhorses throughout the world.&quot;
We will miss a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you state that &quot;in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman fellowship...at the same time he was studying for a bachelor&#39;s degree, one master&#39;s degree and one doctorate.&quot;
This is learned from a Woodruff author&#39;s note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor JD Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois for good.
Why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Party for the Freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to introduce the organization &quot;Cities against Islamization&quot; in Antwerp , on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting the mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria the same weekend far-right political parties made huge gains in the country&#39;s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened in an attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by news of the desecration, which reached Muslim clerics as the month of Ramadan drew to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the shift to the right in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that grabbed almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had run a campaign focused on vehement anti-immigration and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also voiced his opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change was brought about mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have barred Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates placed Glitter on a six-month ban after he informed law enforcement authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued an overseas travel ban last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter&#39;s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates&#39; Court in Kent, but was represented by solicitor Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: &quot;On Thursday 25th September at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested a ruling to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from traveling abroad including to France and Spain until 25th September. March.
&quot;Paul Gadd did not attend in person.&quot;
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that she wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being on the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the planned date seven days before your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter&#39;s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: &quot;Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: &quot;Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
&quot;In our view, it&#39;s easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all potential risks more effectively.
&quot;Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county to minimize any risk that may exist to the public.&quot;
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London.
However, he said he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he was eventually flown to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He likely arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates&#39; Court, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Home Office reported that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
&quot;I capture the master offstage to extract his character&quot; Günther Bauer_Photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman.
On one side the artist.
To the other, the person.
Inseparable except in private, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; the theatricality of some performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program for the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition &quot;reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing every day&quot;, explains the creator, who clarifies that &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; &quot;can be anyone but, when looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed &quot;on the street&quot; are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on stage... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don&#39;t have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco greats with the camera&quot;.
With the flavor of the &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot; festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: &quot;A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day&quot;.
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the toque itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the El Fotómata gallery.
Well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will include the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer&#39;s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot;Portraits of Veteran Athletes&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although the concepts are different in &quot;Flamenco-people&quot;, the photographer admits that &quot;I love photographing people, getting to know them and being able to enter their life for a moment, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don&#39;t even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.&quot;
This collection of current flamenco portraits entitled &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 Calle de la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is &quot;reckless&quot;
It is set in places that he still does not know and deals with unknown matters, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project in which he is working, a novel whose protagonist is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years. years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always-favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday during his visit to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that concerns him today &quot;is reckless&quot; and that &quot;everything indicates that he should not write&quot; the novel.
&quot;If I were sensible, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I&#39;m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,&quot; he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred pass through the city of the Aqueduct of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of &quot;The city and the dogs&quot; was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival prize for being the writer most voted for by the participants - an old edition of &quot;Our mutual friend&quot;, by Dickens-, filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated public who felt very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a large dose of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the &quot; extraordinary adventure&quot; of the &quot;pleasure of reading&quot; and &quot;living more than I lived&quot;; how he writes in a &quot;disciplined way&quot; to make up for his &quot;lack of inspiration&quot; with extensive documentation work, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and what &quot;images of memory&quot; are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that &quot;there is no way&quot; to measure and know if books change lives, &quot;but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience,&quot; stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it &quot;has effects&quot; and &quot;makes people more dissatisfied&quot;, for which he asked writers &quot;not to give in to frivolity&quot; and &quot;assume responsibly&quot; their vocation.
The weather diminishes the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of bars
The rejoneadores celebration that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after verifying the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The inclement weather conditions have affected this fair, since finally two of its three festivities could not be held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The cartel was made up of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a running of the bulls in Castilblanco
Thus, only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid off his two bulls with greetings and an ear, which the stands gave more than his bullfighting.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the bullring of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief task, he earned the anger of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Ten to five in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal area of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not one to stop.
The agents pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as AAJ, according to a statement from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident took place when several officials from the Álava Traffic Unit were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as it passes through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and jumped the control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shoulder, at which time its two occupants got out to run away through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally caught up with one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and which they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish, so they proceeded to transfer it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the license plate had been &quot;folded&quot; since it did not coincide with the collection in the van&#39;s documentation, for which reason the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsifying a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape on the run as has been said, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old AAJ, was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will go to court in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of some drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the series Melrose Place, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of some drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to back out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol has revealed to People magazine.
The witness has detailed that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear &quot;was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to move the car forwards and backwards out of the parking lot, and when going in reverse it ran over his sunglasses several times &quot;.
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who did not appear to have recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby freeway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who notified the emergency services because &quot;she was worried about Locklear&#39;s life.&quot;
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
&quot;She seemed disoriented,&quot; so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although &quot;from the officers&#39; first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication.&quot;
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 7:00 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that must make a decision on the case of the former Councilor for Youth and Sports of the Seville City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who he resigned last week after he was accused of favoring relatives.
&quot;For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers,&quot; said Llamazares about the action that the party must adopt with the one who until now has been a councilor in the Seville town hall.
However, the IU leader defended the need for &quot;transparency&quot; to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: &quot;IU has always defended that these types of matters have the maximum degree of transparency.&quot;
Along the same lines, he stressed that the formation has &quot;strict ethical codes for all public positions.&quot;
&#39;Blood of May&#39;, Garci&#39;s epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to &quot;illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis&quot; that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a length of more than two and a half hours, opens this Friday in cinemas, to become a miniseries for Telemadrid in the future of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós&#39; literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled &quot;a childhood dream&quot; with this filming, for which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary on May 2 in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to set the scene with the appropriate sets and costumes the portrait of &quot;a reckless Spain that had the wrong boss to fight for, since that the fight for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII&quot;, he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having received financing like Alatriste or Goya&#39;s Ghosts -more than double that of Sangre de Mayo-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Start Again, has influenced what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and with whom he does not do casting, it seems to him &quot; humiliating&quot; and consider that &quot;part of the director&#39;s job is to go to the theater and the cinema to find out what is happening in the industry in which he works&quot;.
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Nominated for an Oscar on four occasions -of which he won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the one finally selected, The blind sunflowers do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, &quot;which is the one that should make itself known&quot;, he assured.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
&quot;In the beginning you think you are working for posterity, then you realize that you are only working for prosperity, and now you are satisfied with making one more film&quot;, explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian bailaora is going to honor a dancer who is also from Sevillian.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women&#39;s liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible.&quot;
According to the bailaora, &quot;we don&#39;t intend to recount her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of their dances have suggested flamenco styles to me.
Thus, &quot;the dance of the butterfly&quot; suggested a guajira to me, or &quot;the dance of the serpent&quot; some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic&quot;, he affirms.
The production has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, just as he did in &quot;La puerta abierta&quot;; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
&quot;Matilde plays Tortola when she is older, the character of maturity.
I&#39;m happy that he agreed to act in my play and I feel very honored by it.&quot;
The show also features the musical composition and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, &quot;who plays the role of the eternal accompanist of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love of them&quot;.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London. .
&quot;I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who had enormous influence at a certain time and now nobody knows, much less values her work,&quot; says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Philology
&quot;I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino &quot;Flamenco y vida&quot; because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.&quot;
The publication of the &quot;Diary of a newly married poet&quot; also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the &quot;Diary of a Recently Married Poet&quot; at Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the traveling exhibition &quot; Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz&quot;, which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the &quot;Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado&quot;, edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue disseminating the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes itself less without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.&quot;
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Even so, it has been a blow to everyone.
&quot;Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,&quot; cried Robert Redford, &quot;my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.&quot;
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and of the country had died at a particularly dark moment, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem in tatters, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and men are without virtue and you have very few beings to admire, you don&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of causes won and lost, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
Quite a gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shock wave of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the pinnacle of his career.
Australian bad boy Russell Crowe dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
&quot;He has set the bar very high for all of us,&quot; noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the requirement of probity and having a serious and remote private life. of the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today&#39;s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when surely he had plenty of opportunities not to be.
&quot;But why am I going to eat a hamburger outside the house, if I have a steak inside?&quot; he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
&quot;Of all the great roles he played, none was he prouder than devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,&quot; they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday&#39;s race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst race by far that I&#39;ve been to.
A height of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I examined it, it would be a very clear fail.
But let&#39;s go by parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the number, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn&#39;t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go, give it your all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well no.
Here they only made you go to pick up your bib number (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size &#39;S&#39; for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are small things compared to race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue when you arrive is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we still hadn&#39;t left our backpack, although once it was done, collecting it was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was coupled with attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I think that some 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me will not even appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown a preview of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company&#39;s campus) according to what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this &quot;receptionist&quot; can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not a company employee.
He asks if he&#39;s there to visit someone and tells him he&#39;ll see him shortly.
All without blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won&#39;t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
Quite a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and &quot;extras&quot; to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who bought into the theory that it was Google&#39;s first move to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It fulfills the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It&#39;s true.
It will never disappear but you have to think about the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer boots only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo in this post was taken in one of Microsoft&#39;s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
At the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - &quot;Your search. Our future.&quot;
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, more like 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look to the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, is becoming more like a computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d&#39;Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick&#39;s &#39;Blood Diamond&#39;, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39; and it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start listing stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that strongman with the pointy mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical tight-fitting, sleeveless cotton undershirt for men.
The &#39;tank&#39;, which the Anglo speakers call it, but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, because of its bombastic name - although it is familiarly known as &#39;Marcel&#39; - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
&#39;La Marcel&#39; stands out from the rest for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models have as a detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for comfort underwear.
Although it is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second round for the best seller from Honda
In the month of November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample room, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to all this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that follows, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, a country where the Jazz has been the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, close to one million units of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of all Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Likewise, the Japanese firm expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to sell nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented to society in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five more centimeters), the width to 1.69 meters (two more centimeters) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Likewise, the boot capacity - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the first generation boot capacity.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of the Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter mechanics gets a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a cost of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now it has 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to be a young mother; the candidate does not worry me&quot;
Her enormous resemblance to her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than just some pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm is doing at its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the &#39;Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and the Opera dinner in honor of of Valentine.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like getting lost in a city and observing the way women are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren&#39;t you?
I think so but, in the end, it all comes together and they have many ties in common.
Since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s house to rummage through my aunt&#39;s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You already know that we dancers really like to make our outfits for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when they give you the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You recently turned 30, have you had a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn&#39;t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks me to and, in addition, I want to be a young mother; I don&#39;t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I don&#39;t care.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for several premieres that you shot last year.
That&#39;s right and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I&#39;m looking forward to the premiere of &#39;The Last Hour&#39; and &#39;In Search of the Tomb of Christ&#39;.
Let&#39;s see what you think...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don&#39;t say that.
It is not that I got on a catwalk to be a model.
Naomi Campbell, who I&#39;ve known for a long time, just called me to invite me to come to London to do a charity show for her organization &#39;Women for a Better World&#39; and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi&#39;s.
People don&#39;t know that tender heart of Naomi&#39;s.
So many things are said about her that, who knows her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Also, I&#39;ll take that good part in which she gets involved.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do a headstand, then too.
For benefiting third world women, whatever it takes.
The &#39;bee car&#39; that avoids collisions
To advance in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management R&amp;D, the BR23C is billed as an extension of Nissan&#39;s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to reinforce the collision avoidance capacity of the brand&#39;s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Security Shield.
But most important are the bee&#39;s compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately translates into preventing collision.
&quot;The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, nor diagonally; It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that its wheels allow it to turn, and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, to help the little robot avoid collisions.
&quot;This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It requires no save information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we&#39;re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes.&quot;
This is the first step in developing new instant collision avoidance technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles in the way.
Repeated drivers for breath alcohol must install the &#39;alcolock&#39;
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for breathalyzer, to have to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General&#39;s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Road Safety Attorney General&#39;s Office, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Fundación Instituto Tecnológico para la Seguridad Automóvil (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected that is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is greater than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned party.
In this sense, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infractions by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing such behaviors before they lead to criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be carried out through ordinary channels, and, nevertheless, the necessary reform through criminal proceedings requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been implanted experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without &#39;peep-toes&#39;
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., the time scheduled in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias were traveling landed at the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays still made it necessary to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before, he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can&#39;t go to the airport to load at that time... She&#39;s from here or something like that...
- No, no sir, she is Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salute of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, long hair blowing in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual &#39;peep-toes&#39;, perhaps she had been told that a storm was threatening in Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before going to the room where the official delegation is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a talkative reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
tremble before mortgage
Admittedly, the US Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of injection fluid, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created an entertaining and informative game for the browser: &#39;Bad Credit Hotel&#39;.
In other words, the &#39;Hotel of bad credits&#39;... or of troubles.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detail.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don&#39;t even talk about buying a better house...
The best endowed fashion award
There is possibly no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is possibly no more exquisite and bont vivan designer alive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the firm&#39;s second largest store in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for chairing the jury for the contest, led us to end up at a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the most exquisite Chagals nearby, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart breaking with grief and grieving her heart, due to the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and some ELAH dressings, which took your breath away, and on the arm of her son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up, together with the Baron de Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who came to the store wearing pants and a shirt - of her own design - and for dinner transformed into a sexy long black dress, was moved when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room ballet rehearsal and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a feint of &#39;grand plie&#39;.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk through the palace premises, but beforehand she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to delight our eyes with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon who travels on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there not be smells in your room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c&#39;est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 plus ways to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it goes off every morning at 7 in the morning, but it&#39;s even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace that modern life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, the classic massage or &#39;spa&#39; treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole &#39;menu&#39; of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called &#39;1001 ways to relax&#39; and its calm will reach bookstores thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this &#39;manual&#39; refutes such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore balance to the body and stress has become a problem, it&#39;s time to sit on the couch, switch off your mind and focus on reading.
talk sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very alert telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens you might get a scare, but it really doesn&#39;t matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting (peeing while asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, single words, a whisper or the opposite (shouting, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be convenient to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him an outlet in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it cannot be treated, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress disorder).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the somniloquias appear, try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day they will not remember anything that happened.
Helpful tips
Don&#39;t wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will disturb his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if he is very distressed during several episodes, it would be convenient to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If what he says is understood (which is not the most common), do not be tempted to question him to extract information from him.
You will not achieve anything, because being asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even kidding.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not bad at all, it&#39;s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found its way to victory on its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having played a good game, the team created many scoring chances and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors found it difficult to express themselves.
After a first attempt by captain Kauffmann who brushed the squad with a shot from distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the &quot;power&quot; and in turn Fonderflick from distance, then with Hirn on top, Romain with the tip of his foot or even Diebold came to impede Dannemarie&#39;s defense.
In front, we didn&#39;t let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two scoring chances by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoring for the Illhousiens with the goal by Marais, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt at Diebold (53&#39;).
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who fell back a bit to &quot;compress&quot; their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a significant sputtering, the ball passed very close to the field cross.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Brittany.
Faced with a demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to find their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him &quot;with a constructive spirit&quot; and hope that &quot;he will come with concrete proposals&quot;.
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the &quot;crisis committee&quot; created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the increase in diesel prices, which set a record by reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save employment and remuneration conditions for sailors&quot;.
The fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
&quot;A seeping barrier&quot; has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and English coasts, such as Les Sables d&#39;Olonne, in Vendée, where the bous stayed in port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the trading ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the afternoon.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national committee for fisheries, which did not support their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;the fishermen did not give up&quot; and &quot;they do not want to go to Paris&quot;, announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial break-even point of a boat can only be reached with diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euro per liter.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of &quot;Two men and one destiny&quot; has died of cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession weighing on the world economy.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Embraer&#39;s president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would seek to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its 85 billion dollar loan, according to Sunday&#39;s edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper specifies.
AIG&#39;s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to discuss possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, that is, a loss never seen in the Stock Market of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, that is, the day on which the exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks of 11 of September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index fell 8.81% (that is, 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have made it possible to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans in three rejected his plan.
&quot;This is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress incapable of adopting a plan,&quot; estimated Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
&quot;This shows to what extent the market was counting on this plan&quot;, added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive &quot;too late&quot;.
&quot;If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. de la Red) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions&quot;, warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, &quot;every day that passes the fall of a financial institution is announced&quot; in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for rival Citigroup to buy Wachovia&#39;s banking activities.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, triggering emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing &quot;not just a crisis in the US but a a global crisis,&quot; added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market rose sharply.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond 4.161%, against 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock listing.
Within a week of discovering a tentative agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out based on a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, that is, 28% above its current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley share was still down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
&quot;This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley towards the status of bank holding company&quot;, explained Juan Mack, the general director of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but it passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
&quot; A week ago, explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, &quot;we thought that the participation would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and hedge. &quot;
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of close to 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common stock within a year if the common stock sells for more than 50% above the conversion price, or more or less $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, refused to give details about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should post a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it has eased its balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been grueling for the group, which has seen its share price halve as the cost of insuring against a default risk on its debt has skyrocketed.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;survivor&quot; of the big Wall Street investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcies and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third Sunday that has put a project for a new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted &quot;yes&quot; to the referendum, according to the official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the &quot;no&quot; obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the &quot;yes&quot;, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
The &quot;Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,&quot; he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in complete calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the &quot;new socialism&quot; defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the &quot;development planning&quot; of a country that essentially lives thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters claimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, while honorable, was not &quot;brilliant&quot; enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who came out well.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama emerged victorious with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of the same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts,&quot; Bill Clinton nevertheless warned this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy matters, underlining his adversary&#39;s &quot;naivete&quot; on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
&quot;Senator Obama does not seem to understand that…&quot; he accused several times.
&quot; I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president &quot;, he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without being fazed, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
&quot;McCain still hasn&#39;t understood, while Obama has already done it,&quot; replied, this weekend, a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans.
&quot; During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an electoral rally in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He did not utter the words &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;workers.&quot; &quot; The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the character most capable of saving the economy that is on the brink of the precipice.
&quot;Next week could be a decisive episode&quot;, estimated yesterday the influential and Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a longtime member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s &quot;good economic instincts&quot; to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster &quot;is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.&quot;
Reaffirming that he would go so far as to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the shocks on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies It was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates dodged the questions that referred to the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
&quot; In Minsk, &quot; Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? &quot;
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the legislative results in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: &quot;the dictator must resign.&quot;
Some acknowledge not having voted: &quot;why, since they will do what they want with my vote&quot;, says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put on a brave face for foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
The sanctions, among which the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered fair by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
&quot;We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the recount of the votes&quot;, lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
&quot;It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
&quot;But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills.&quot;
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because &quot;the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don&#39;t reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.&quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored the manipulations.
&quot;Have you noticed the elections? Question the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power. &quot;
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukashenko and members of the central electoral commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been freed by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked well upon their arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
&quot;They are in good health&quot; and &quot;no ransom was paid&quot; to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while they were enjoying a jeep safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one hole to another.
The group was made up of eleven tourists -five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian- and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
&quot;An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the rest have fled,&quot; said this official who remained anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the &quot;lightning&quot; unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
&quot;It must be recognized that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, from the special forces,&quot; he declared without going into details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a jeep carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief, and detaining two.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity, (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Lyrics - Silent Majority Culture
A debate on the financing of culture fait les manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better this way.
But a sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable sums that are given to small museums, archives, archeological digs or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don&#39;t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros to restore the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all this, in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped into 211 history, heritage, archives and genealogy societies are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money lots of archives private and preserve archaeological remains.
It is these that are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with energy and despair when promoters and managers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Interview - Blood Is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most efficient blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the trust of the public that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood pools managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Canadian government conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and formulate recommendations so that such a disaster does not happen. play more.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his account, certain provinces then created a committee whose objective was to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
&quot;In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was grim.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work in the years that followed, we have regained the trust of the public,&quot; he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population henceforth he had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Doctor Décary reminds, however, that &quot;trust is something extremely fragile&quot;.
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, in Europe we were witnessing the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn&#39;t know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. &quot;
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far.
Nucleic acid tests made it possible to shorten the period between the moment the person was infected and the moment the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
In this way, we substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements made it possible to considerably lower the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
&quot;That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain your health without worry,&quot; says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
&quot;Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant &quot;, pursues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
&quot;The needs increase because the population ages.
Because of the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which brings together on average only 3% of Quebecois eligible to donate blood. &quot;
All people in good health, 18 years of age and meeting the eligibility criteria can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
&quot;With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since life today is very hectic, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood &quot;, mourns Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered biomedical waste, is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
&quot; A few weeks ago we celebrated the bank of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year&quot;, says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
&quot;Many moms are disappointed that they can&#39;t take advantage of this,&quot; since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL first division qualifying series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in summary ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many scoring chances.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon at the Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but series details will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The Canadian&#39;s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in the Canadian&#39;s 3-2 free-throw win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec racked up two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor&#39;s fourth in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory scoring the only goal.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet, warned the Russian.
&quot; I need another match to feel comfortable. &quot;
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. &quot;
Charest deals with the North
The prime minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (from the left), is trying to get himself elected during today&#39;s by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern frontier &quot;: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining exploitation, Quebec seen by &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc., paraded.
Big media like during the election period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made it appear that his schedule was very full.
The &quot;Plano Norte&quot; is the fourth side of a &quot;vision&quot; that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a &quot;new economic space&quot;, which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in recent prime minister&#39;s speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself, however, to explaining why the North was &quot;a jewel with immense potential&quot;, but he did not give a term, investment amounts, nor precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond&quot;, according to Mr. Charest&#39;s enumeration.
This &quot;territory twice the size of France&quot;, &quot;is our home, it is in Quebec.
It is not only our home, but it is in us,&quot; he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood to the gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It belongs to us, it is our future&quot;, he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister specified during the press conference.
&quot;It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government,&quot; he said.
In addition, &quot;with the climatic changes, we must rethink our vision of the North,&quot; he declared, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly the youth.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy from Ungava&#39;s Quebec party), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The prime minister does not rule out an important meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a meeting in which &quot;a common vision will be given&quot;.
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan &quot;will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment&quot;, he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as one that is in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
&quot; Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. &quot;
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s coming to power in the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Power Plant into the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
&quot;From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future&quot;, declared Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, this conservative one, the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching on the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
&quot;This remains between us, but I anticipate being there,&quot; he confided to his militants, drawing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot; which had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party demands in particular recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec&quot; in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for them to have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we received the main lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Québec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced applying it.
If it had done so, &quot;we would make progress today&quot; commented Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the government&#39;s adoption of a Plan Nord.
&quot;But what is wanted is that this is not just a show&quot;, commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Lyrics - A Disgraced Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of &quot;Justice&quot; (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say that Luisa Arbor was a &quot;disgrace&quot; to Canada.
Thus dishonoring this woman who led an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, which says everything about the relations between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are accused of occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who collides with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he enjoys the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We don&#39;t realize it yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our &quot;democracy,&quot; that&#39;s the word Harper keeps repeating, and it makes no sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the minority head of government until now wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J . Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world&#39;s largest gold company launched a six million euro libel suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a &quot;transparent public debate.&quot;
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to yours?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little consequence, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these lopsided fights, is often to bankrupt the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as scare off anyone who will dare to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold had truly wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that it would have had to present its view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by exchanging ideas and not by blows of a club.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a true debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for Noir Canada authors.
Possibly Mr. Garver could explain how you can ask for a &quot;public&quot; debate disregarding the latter&#39;s views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so above all because it rejects the mining company&#39;s brutal manner.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge it, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a gag chase (in pursuit of &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick Gold has just deposited a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver&#39;s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of university and truth-seeking essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that are disliked by the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a transparent, public debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Bailout - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan that aims to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: a better control by those elected of its implementation, of new mechanisms that aim to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed houses and non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the supported companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
&quot; We made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets &quot;, declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
&quot;Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,&quot; explained the Democrat.
&quot;It&#39;s the bottom line: If we don&#39;t do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,&quot; said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The latest time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who joined the negotiations late, showed themselves rather favorable for the agreement, without forgetting, however, to express their discontent to be forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to keep their domicile and the one on the salary of the managers of the surviving companies by the State.
&quot;When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, do not congratulate yourself.
But these measures are necessary,&quot; he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, when asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: &quot;I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it.&quot;
&quot;The important points that I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option to do nothing is not acceptable.&quot;
The 700 billion plan intends to buy doubtful debts, risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions with taxpayers&#39; money.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit titles (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a rout of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe we are out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain &quot;toxic&quot; assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
To smooth things over for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years on this program, it could impose new rates that were meant to help it get money back.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
Payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for their help, Washington will obtain shares in the companies that have been rescued, which will earn them dividends in the event of profits and which they can sell again when the storm has passed.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the foreclosure procedures that concerned the houses obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the directors of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan&#39;s architects would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives starting today and in the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this bill yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, told his constituents that &quot;by all accounts, Washington does not want to understand.&quot;
&quot;We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers &quot;.
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the issues differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path that must be taken,&quot; he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars). ) during the subprime real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
&quot; This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It&#39;s just something savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain. &quot;
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Compromised Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with the charming smile had broken free of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have distanced him from the power register that true holy monsters have.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the heyday.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he closely resembled and who was long considered a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German-Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last quality mark.
Because in it an entire country in love with the self-made man was projected, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor&#39;s Studio in New York, before to succeed in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward .
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of showbiz that we don&#39;t know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused vertigo among moviegoers this weekend, while his great roles collided on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the American seventh art in perpetual change passes through it.
Many memories come back to mind like the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958 .
Closer to Us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise&#39;s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprized after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This likeable thug in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Blow), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen&#39;s magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know about him especially thanks to George Roy Hill&#39;s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in the Coen brothers&#39; The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as a godfather to the Irish mob in Sam Mendes&#39; Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several movie legends who dropped out of the race quite early, Newman stayed long in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, &quot;as a challenge that lives in &quot;underplaying&quot; and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played the role of young heartthrob less often than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides of his true modesty not well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a melancholy female portrait.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
&quot;Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: &quot; my life and my country were better thanks to its existence &quot;
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over vinaigrette sauce boats, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method in bad taste, even though it started as a gag.
Proceeds from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Distress.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: &quot;Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be there. &quot;
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory produce?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor&#39;s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and those of the municipalities - in their totality about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
For this, they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company the falsified invoice should be issued on behalf of was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented, among others, in the contests of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his &quot;field trips&quot; Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people cannot fit in that place at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later renamed Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Well, a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill included one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy bills also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center, because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor&#39;s Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor&#39;s office and they showed him the invoices, he already knew that they were false documents.
&quot;On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place.&quot;
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice, one hundred people stayed, since they only have eleven rooms that do not fit that many people.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the invoice for cash payment they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency billing practice.
In addition - as it became known during the investigation - they included VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that trips outside the territory of the European Union were tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of said company are not charged with 25 but only 15 percent VAT, In addition, the hotel employees only issued invoices made by machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the &quot;shippers&quot; also made other mistakes, such as in the case of a company in which they included road transport as an activity on the invoice, which - it became known during the prosecution&#39;s investigations - is not carried out by the company founded as a consultant of investments.
Likewise, due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was learned that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI, are false. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued these invoices.
Neither did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, which is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They knowingly issued the invoices
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are made up of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice for about four million HUF in the name of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way, the Biogate Kft., currently undergoing liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately 5 million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő association. Egyesület, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, since they later canceled the invoices prepared but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice makers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the sued of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for an approximate value of HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were bought by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány in the name of the company, collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, they issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y -Generation
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor&#39;s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a tender in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
So that this is not discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the defendants will probably recount in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor&#39;s Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
Well, his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done until now.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing it? Perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own homes for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overprice the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis for this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this &quot;game&quot; by means of experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction, and meanwhile, the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games the participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called the stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the &quot;self-reward&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a precaution so as not to provoke an intense reaction from the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists in the scientific group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the commodity in question, and its members gambled.
Another group on top of that was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more in prize money.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus, the only difference between the two groups was that success was highlighted for one and failure for the other.
However, testing the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, the members of the &quot;against failure&quot; group were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the &quot;winning&quot; group.
&quot;These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Well, until now they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we come to a third explanation&quot; - stated Andrew Schotter, a professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; infection of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread by two main ways: hepatitis A and E through food (for example with infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and fluids. bodily (sperm, vaginal fluid, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to protect themselves with a vaccine against viruses A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the whites of the eyes, the stool becomes clear, the urine dark in color and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in the world from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of those infected do not know they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition and systematic medical control are very important.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world who have chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control too, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease is curable if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the organism, thus the contagion can be suppressed and cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support a total of 11.2 thousand million euros to this financial and insurance institution that also does business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition at the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the Euro zone in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves for more than a year, therefore the decisions adopted with respect to the Bank, in a certain sense can considered as precedents.
According to the decision adopted in the early hours of Sunday, the three States will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property that the Bank owns in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a part of its businesses, including above all the activities -mainly insurance- bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, this Bank is too big to allow it to fail.
The company&#39;s shares on Friday alone fell 12 percent, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
Looking at current share prices, the total value of the group&#39;s capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank&#39;s management attributed the sharp drop in Fortis shares to the insecurities of the North American market in relation to the approval of the American package plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they named Filip Dierckx as the bank&#39;s new CEO.
The Bank also sought individual investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already previously ensured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Until now there has been no panic among the Bank&#39;s clients, they have not invaded bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviates the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this singular experiment, they applied an electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which, along with academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis occurred as follows; a sparking instrument was attached to the patient&#39;s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a work by Sassoferrato from the 17th century and the Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci from the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo&#39;s oil painting because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while looking at the religious or other theme painting.
The Catholics affirmed that when looking at the Virgin Mary they felt &quot;safe&quot; as &quot;protected&quot; people, &quot;they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts.&quot;
When looking at the painting with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo&#39;s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so impressive a similar effect can be achieved with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
&quot;We should find a portrait of a person for whom they feel very positive, such as a mother or a father&quot; - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the inquiry.
&quot;The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality,&quot; added Wright.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: what effect would it have on pain regulation if the Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of his stature were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people&#39;s pockets and in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they see and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company&#39;s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times newspaper that Google&#39;s main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary in order to fulfill the original goals of Google&#39;s founders: &quot;let&#39;s gather in one system all the information in the world!&quot;
According to the leader of Google, the company, even after ten years of work that has shaken the world, is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
When asked what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like &quot;What to do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;What would be the best job for me?&quot; - However, the software will not be able to answer such apparently simple questions as long as there is not enough information from the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Internet, the keywords searched for, the IP addresses and the pages they went to at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can go back to what they searched for before, what they opened, and thanks to this history, they will generate much more personalized searches -in this same logic will base the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google&#39;s information monopoly.
In most cases it is rather the potential represented by the company that can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, the yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that they not only keep, but in justifiable cases they also transfer to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google provided the Brazilian government with information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
In contrast, Internet users who care about people&#39;s rights were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that they were right in their lawsuit. with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain, under the pretext of enforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor neither are the complete lists of Web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
Thus, the opinion on Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the &quot;vanguard corporation&quot;, not their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World. , no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free software package is constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than practice. from the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the highly problematic relationship between people&#39;s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can be included in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We know of numerous cases from which it can be deduced that, for example, the girlfriend, upon seeing the flow of photos of mutual friends the next morning, finds out with whom her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his candid opinion on the direction of the company on his blog: one thing is certain, the definition of private life has been completely revalued.
A person&#39;s online life is what he shows of himself - this is the definition behind the behavior of today&#39;s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google&#39;s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with the Scroogle that uses Google&#39;s search system, but leaves no trace).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid being found, but you can replace Google&#39;s &quot;online&quot; applications, from copywriting software to imaging and news reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly awaits the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the surfaces of AdWords/AdSense advertising threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, while increasingly rapidly introduced services cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, top management flatly rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company&#39;s day care center, considered unlimited employee meals too expensive, but All of this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all information that violated good morals and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to work, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years may turn the world upside down: while that some believe that Google&#39;s book and magazine scanning and archiving project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be summoned by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own health profile complete, with previous tests, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database could provide good raw material for science fiction writers. Scroogled, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man alone from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped cover up the tracks of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to a well-founded suspicion, helped to cover up the traces of the crime - the spokesman for the General Commissariat for Public Order of the Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime that was charged to them, and are currently accused of being the perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of Ózd &#39;s double murder -- a 23 - year - old man -- has been in pretrial detention since Sunday .
He is accused of the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday of last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim&#39;s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared himself long before to perpetrate the crime, since he committed the murder with a previously hidden weapon at the scene of the crime.
The police analyze the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion CZK - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of them in a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer from the Poles was the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with this, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear. Prague.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at around 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 percent. hundred.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a &quot;second 9/11&quot;.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, whose objective is to solve this desperate situation. ..
Instead of a new &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it is more correct to speak of a &quot;second 9/11&quot;.
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the error of the political direction of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the North American monetary system grows more and more and this will later have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington offers no political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - points out the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva.
Some states today can still throw lifebelts to wobbly financial institutions, thereby saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, like the dominoes, even more banks collapse, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will suffice.
In the long term, the member states of the European Union are needed to put aside their nationalistic egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are becoming more real that, just as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
Up to now the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that passes like a cuname across the Old Continent.
The &quot;saviors&quot; will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be nice if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to prevent a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing collision avoidance technologies, if not mimicking existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example that of the bumblebees.
In an amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C-type robotic car steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions. .
During the flight, each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, RP technology director and research and development director, at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle&#39;s microprocessor which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance maneuver.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle, imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
&quot;Otherwise, the vehicle robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and vehicle robot project.
You must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, a layer within which all types of collisions are now considered inevitable.
The entire process should reflect what a bumblebee does to avoid other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here they only used rotational movement and acceleration as well as braking as a possibility for the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, much less the storage.
This device only has to process a few input signals every second and react accordingly.
There is no need to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, thus using only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory needed.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, within ten years can be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding obstacles in his way.
This dear child already has a name
The written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases in order to buy the bad credits of the banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to East Coast time during new consultations that lasted until after midnight Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion. - reported Reuters.
We have achieved important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the US Congress, stating that all that remains is to formalize the agreement in a document.
The compromise assumed on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Finance Minister, speaking about the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and it will be efficient but more steps are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car around the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (that is, before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time). ), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
Regarding the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization of the year 2008, the North American Congress will vote first on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush conferred with Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress achieved overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - stated Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration&#39;s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars will be able to be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, bad ratings and the The destination of another 100 billion dollars depends on the president&#39;s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be able to be spent after a new decision by Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other &quot;poisonous&quot; type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or directly - competent people from the ministry informed.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrisome elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson affirmed: the law ensures in such a way the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to satisfy the urgent needs of the American financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
Instead, bank bosses who are in trouble and expect state help will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which American slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Payments will only be limited in some certain cases, and the limitations also depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, an extra tax will be levied on the gold parachutes, unless the bank&#39;s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits outright, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses&#39; severance pay is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to the new contracts to thus also stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation on the income of CEOs will be in force - said the measure the Democrat Barney Frank, president of the congressional commission responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they will even be able to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recover.
According to the bill, in the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected - declared the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were urged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year will no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that the chances are high that the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waivers will come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago to the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion &quot;practically everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on time on the other side of the Atlantic&quot;.

Starting today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice presenting her with the Medium Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain .
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bailout package for the banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two big North American parties, assured on Sunday their support for the bank aid program of 700 million dollars of the administration, instead there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Congressional and administration representatives, after marathon-type negotiations lasting several days, announced early Sunday morning: an agreement in principle has been reached on the banks&#39; bailout package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival in getting the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama gained some edge again and McCain&#39;s lead that he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin&#39;s vice-presidential candidacy disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
&quot;We have to act now and responsibly (...) employment is in danger, your savings as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy&quot; - he said before a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain&#39;s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain explained that &quot;we will all swallow this with great difficulty (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.&quot;
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any significant role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congress Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review from the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the voters have become more conscientious - says Der Spiegel about the CSU&#39;s weak electoral result in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red and black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled &quot;The Bavarian Revolution Devours Its Parents&quot; he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
The Social Christians were developing Bavaria for several decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for the entire Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not totally surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been anticipated for almost ten years came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU got 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still during the much-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devourer province of its progenitors.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong about the rhythm. However, secularization, educational outcomes and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
With modernization the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, except that within the group itself the voters have become more conscious, critical and stubborn.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who were the ones that distanced themselves the most from the CSU; the self-employed, small industrialists, those with a baccalaureate and graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily: &quot;Who with whom? In his article entitled &quot;Party chairmen are very secretive on coalition issues&quot; - he deals with the confused domestic political situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens, on the other hand, do not yet want to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely let anything of their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, in the position of vice-chancellor.
He stated that they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era if anything.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these questions must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ president Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
&quot;To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government&quot; - said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris. Its host is France, which this year is also the rotating president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, deputy of the European People&#39;s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary session, as one of the main speakers at this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that they whip gypsy children and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
&quot;Most of the young Roma have not finished high school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma.&quot;
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a determining role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in teaching Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to broadly raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Roma.
Well, the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances they have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
&quot;Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education&quot; - highlighted Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for which the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
&quot;We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility guaranteed by the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights&quot; - demanded Járóka.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since the meeting in Berlin last year, which took place under the banner of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European level and at the national level of the Member States.
fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, upon seeing the data on drug purchases, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
&quot;There are programs for the protection of personal data, which binds the use of prescription data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, &quot;we entrust the chicken coop to the fox&quot; - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the program for tracking medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the client&#39;s state of health and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: with the client&#39;s identification number he easily obtains from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the illnesses and state of health of the patient. customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is almost incurably high, so you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company as well as the administration hardly has anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medications are multipurpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves, and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient&#39;s approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they have not received a fine for their negligence up to now.
Some companies lately also prepare the results of laboratory tests and uniting them with data on drug consumption, they obtain more precise information on the patient&#39;s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that grants the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of their own personal data.
It is another matter that said person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo will be made at the end of October
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been beheaded at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party chairman, and Günther Beckstein, provincial premier still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party&#39;s extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo hinted: they do not cling so much to their positions.
With this they tried to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, whereas now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they got only 43, 4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a &quot;monopoly&quot; in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the conservatives still dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
In the first sign of party restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of Huber&#39;s possible successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group starting negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters of right over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli enters parliament on the list of Free Voters, whose action against Stoiber was used for the coup by the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased the ambitious local politician from the stage.
The CSU&#39;s top leadership is now pouring all its energy into stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who until now has been pulling the strings in the background, will receive an active role in the transition. The former provincial head of government and former CSU president described September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able together to lift up the CSU that played a key role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU&#39;s losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be any easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko&#39;s opposition: 110-0
After Sunday&#39;s elections, there will be no opposition deputy in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one hundred and ten deputies, has had no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday&#39;s elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko , who renewed his mandate for the fourth time after the 2006 elections of doubtful legitimacy, as a consequence of the modification of the Constitution this time &quot;would allow&quot; the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition&#39;s expectations was that Belarus - which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - took out a loan to moderate Russia&#39;s increasingly expensive natural gas imports and contributed to Russia&#39;s sale of the Beltransgaz , owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not grant entry permission to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis more on positive phenomena than on mistakes - such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates from participating.
However Monday&#39;s primary OSCE report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates were not allowed to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the vote count.
With all this, in the opinion of the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is felt: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month now.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that &quot;the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter this weightless parliament.&quot;
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations after seeing the results, but rather tries to get its message across to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This of course causes us a lot of problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities make it difficult for it to be distributed, but even so I see that more and more are supporting the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich , alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country&#39;s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that &quot;resembles the silence of cemeteries&quot; - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: &quot;People do not believe in words but in deeds&quot;, so the opposition&#39;s failure is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Marseille global menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are trade partners of each other, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly to discuss cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more say and vote in international affairs but the member countries have not yet been able to come to a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to say, to increase its commercial exchange to more than one hundred billion euros.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
Thus, the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonized, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India&#39;s largest trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union&#39;s trading partners.
The summit turned its attention to global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will cling to its energy and climate program, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as in the climate conference next year a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the Indian head of government will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt international book fair.
There will be more than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international book exhibition in Frankfurt expects for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural goods and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the print will follow in Room Struktur in hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Brunetta: &quot;From now on you have breakfast before starting work&quot;
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of personnel.
but from today this measure begins against those who file and then go to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
&quot;Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services&quot; the minister specifies.
&quot;Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is Reformism&quot;, Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi &quot;the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view&quot;.
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, assures the general secretary: &quot;it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on their part&quot;.
In short, no more breakfast during work hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Word from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, &quot;a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand&quot;.
During a convention at the Superior School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister declares that &quot;in three months the absences due to illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that means 60 thousand more people to work in a year&quot;.
And he adds that it is necessary to render the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, &quot;whose salary dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate&quot;.
For now, millions of public employees have united to oppose the regulations of the Brunetta decree, adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
&quot;While the Minister of Civil Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism from work due to illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of &#39;lazy workers&#39; is continuously increasing.
Indeed, in Italy there are millions of correct and productive employees of the public administration who have united to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree&quot;.
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of added economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: &quot;Crucial prevention&quot;
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data does indeed confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all Italian provinces the 58th national day for victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October .
&quot;The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is&quot;, affirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his &quot;great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion &quot;.
&quot;A sincerely shared &#39;enough&#39; has been manifested, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the outcry of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand, daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamic&quot;.
Napolitano does not hide that &quot;there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is taken by the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness on the part of young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about the social seriousness, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, underlined &quot;how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end to it&quot;.
&quot;The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive&quot;, remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We do not want, indeed, that this &quot;trend to decrease&quot; translates into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
&quot;We believe that at a general level too little is still done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli highlighted - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school &quot;.
&quot;A further effort is needed - he added - as far as communication and awareness of public opinion are concerned.
But it helps, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency&quot;.
Mercandelli has denounced &quot;the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for work victims&quot; and the &quot;assistance referral towards which the system has been heading in recent years.&quot;
&quot;The objective is to restore the worker&#39;s insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who have an accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time&quot;.
Mp3 players under accuse, put hearing at risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
&quot;From this scientific opinion - the note reads - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at loud volume risk permanent hearing loss.
&quot;I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high noise levels may unconsciously ruin their hearing irreparably,&quot; says Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;From the scientific evidence - the EU responsibility follows - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with new technology.&quot;
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, noting the widespread use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
&quot;Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that it is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the member states and interested parties what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable music and related devices&quot;.
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern is growing about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and exposure time to noise.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable musical devices listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, they exceed the limit currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the post. of work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the &quot;Commission for the future of the capital of Rome&quot;, which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyzes and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the &quot;official cake&quot; of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
&quot;The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – tends to emphasize Alemanno – It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse .
There is no role position left, just the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, once the work is finished, it will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome&quot;.
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
Almost always, politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future&quot;.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that &quot;this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and it will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes&quot;.
For Alemanno, indeed, &quot;it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a real leap in level, which we absolutely need, thinking of its future with a united spirit.&quot;
A future that, specifies the mayor of Rome &quot;will not be limited only to the current communal confines but will look beyond&quot; not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but &quot;also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean&quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in passing as an independent: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as a private citizen also does today) with the enemy Islam&quot;.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami has written on a website: &quot;This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: he thinks he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!&quot;.
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial in nature and do not answer the voters&#39; question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth, we will know who the American patriot will vote for.
It leaves one side of the American mentality kept covered to the last.
&quot;Say what you want, we will think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain.&quot;
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before now, that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home on the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush&#39;s weak point.
Whoever will assume the position of George W will have an enormous duty to perform.
Usa, the economic collapse is also making itself felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, &quot;killer&quot; of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Although, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don&#39;t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issuance.
It&#39;s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap in the Internet, for many seen as the &quot;killer&quot; of the printed letter.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope &quot;that it will do some good&quot; for journalism.
The biggest rupture in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the editors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with &quot;job security&quot;.
Executives who plan to lose their job in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The thing about &quot;safe work&quot; at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of &quot;take it or leave it&quot;.
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For vacations, the reasoning becomes complicated: one total number of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get &quot;sick&quot; often during the year.
It&#39;s all a matter of weather.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 million dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
We are given a confirm by yesterday&#39;s New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, ever more torn between its old East Coast, moderate, pro-Fed and business-community soul, and its new soul. , on the other hand, conservative, hostile to &quot;those in Washington&quot; and to the world of finance, strong above all in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just quoted is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the current economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe, for some time now the crisis seems to work as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that, with the new climate, solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category of state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations abroad, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don&#39;t have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union, which, divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, is unable to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is reached, it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the math every day. once again with little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, mind you, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself a sovereign certainly has many more cards than whoever is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of an inadequate economic species revealed with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in increasing numbers.
It seems to advance more and more, in various parts of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites up to now, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term , to have done his own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement to delegitimize the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in an electoral &quot;revolt&quot; or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times. , from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, some would say their format, always make it more difficult to understand and therefore to represent, what from today that is taking form are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis potentially renews, increases and agitates excessively.
Faced with all this, talking about a &quot;mass rebellion&quot; today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn&#39;t.
The super glue to walk on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like spider-man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team from four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a 100-kilo body on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American magazine Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
&quot;The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful on the legs of this reptile and at the same time &quot;it easily detaches from the walls&quot;, explains Liming Dai, Researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
WALK THROUGH THE WALLS? -&quot;This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive,&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Wall-walking capes exactly like Spider-Man? Layers yes, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
ANOTHER RESEARCH - Also the University of Berkeley, in California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of hair-like microfibers that clean themselves of dust as they move over a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken contemporaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered, amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
DRUGS AT RISK – The same Italian drug agency had published the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that this mixture derived from and to pay attention to what is drunk in the event that a risk is being taken drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: &quot;These discoveries are generally reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask the doctor or the pharmacist clearly, &quot;said the expert from the Ansa agency.
The Novice in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted editorial writer for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration&#39;s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack of September 11, 2001, in those days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States. .
A forecast that triggered a lot of controversy and that for several years was blamed on the economy, but that has now been revealed to be accurate.
&quot;I am surprised and a little upset by how quickly the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has faded from public attention,&quot; Krugman had declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is an &quot;economist of great value&quot;, but also a popularizer with a &quot;very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration&quot;.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package&quot;anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, Other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Pay attention also to the multifunction with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific functions of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful, for example, to send it via electronic mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents can be created, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: various users can intervene in the spreadsheet, avoiding conflicts between modifications, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the I comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and it was added to the English one that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or at work.
And if the issue of free can be a hook for diffusion in homes, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big gamble, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is even a lack of realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service ideal for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office is made up of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, like in the case of the well-known Access, is the program that agrees to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that up to now we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the forecast figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also positive in the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best climber&#39;s shirt.
To break the news is the site of the newspaper L&#39;Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth third-generation Epo positive rider, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analyzes of Kohl&#39;s blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the counter tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will go against the two-year canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl&#39;s positive doping in the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the best climber&#39;s shirt.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants &quot;received with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, murdered the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times defines as the &quot;paradox of the north&quot;: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is &quot;more integration and more work&quot; but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most support top of the Northern league.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation wanted by the Lega also tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, it is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedetto XVI in Congress, has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism.&quot;
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett&#39;s plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The rubble has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The Madera County Commissioner, John Anderson, has dispelled the doubts that still remained: &quot;The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is really what Steve Fossett was flying over the day of their disappearance&quot; he said in a press conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been presumed dead in February.
The American Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some of Fossett&#39;s personal remains were found by a couple near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been halted a month after she went missing.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the circumnavigation of the world in a hot air balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made a round-the-world trip by plane and non-stop.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don&#39;t expect
An off-the-beaten-track Suv with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the &quot;compact&quot; all-terrain trucks from the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to its non-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk suv, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of Milan&#39;s shopping mall, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on Como Avenue, it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car is out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will you be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula? we will see.
it is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is at stake.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group that has followed the Italian National for years and that, to tell the truth, has never created too many problems until now.
And they had never met the rival&#39;s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with names, therefore easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled all of them: among those that had come out for Sofia, there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had been prohibited from frequenting a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have had their tickets and travel refused.
Now the Ministry of the Interior waits to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (access ban to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that others will join those few fifty.
&quot;We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize whoever behaves in this way,&quot; they maintain from the Ministry of the Interior.
For this reason, &quot;eyes wide open&quot; especially in view of Wednesday&#39;s National match in Lecce&quot;.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
The Observatory meets tomorrow, the Cams on Tuesday, which can also count on a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is, the secret service, which deals with problems in the stadiums.
&quot;Duce-Duce&#39;s choirs and the raised arm during Mameli&#39;s anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a reato...&quot;.
This is the thought (expressed in an unfortunate way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken over the position that previously belonged to Francesco Tagliente and later to Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of public security in Trieste, where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not unreasonable to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
&quot;I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the event occurs.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about the whistling to Mameli&#39;s hymn: those are also not unreasonable, but if they are allowed they are not polite either...&quot;.
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants&#39; union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people due to the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani – in these cities, strong demand has completely distorted the market to the point of unleashing a process of generalized increase even for residents&quot;.
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, without limit of canon, linked sub-rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax rate, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome, in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask you approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Savings are made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples you get 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed they serve you 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city&#39;s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting to students and non-EU students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historical rooms
The historic movie theaters close favoring the Multiplex.
&quot;A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.&quot;
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the great Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-theaters in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime. .
Historical places are almost always disappearing, full of memory, &quot;it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom you shared a piece of the place and so much emotion&quot;, Observes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago Back, cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes won, which recounted the poetry of a provincial movie theater and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that perhaps lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them are paying for the theaters in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that what is responsible for its disappearance is the agreement of the multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new busy cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
&quot;The Italian exercise has developed irrationally&quot; observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, &quot;it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its patrons are willing to be transferred to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect single-screen cinema in the historic center than on the periphery.
Among the planned regulations there are fiscal facilitation measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
&quot;It is an initiative that I like&quot; observes Giuseppe Tornatore &quot;and I hope that other cities follow Bologna&#39;s example by putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the &quot;New Cinema Paradiso&quot;, which I had been thinking about for a long time. 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale on Via Nazionale, already closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the billboards blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and &#39;ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca&quot;.
The accusations that the magistrates of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate give the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer grandson, namesake of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and compensation of 10 million euros.
&quot;Disregarding any legal and moral norm, and good sense&quot;, write the attorneys, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
&quot;The mafia family would have been allowed – the judges write – to officially enter the interior of the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.&quot;
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that &quot;there are a lot of agreements between organized bad life&quot; in his region: &quot;There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where an agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the &#39;ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.&quot;
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the beheading of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
A scandal broke out when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call the vice minister of the interior, who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political matter, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to request the variation of the project of the A3 highway.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges &quot;the willingness to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families&quot; .
When the energy is born from the waves, the greats come down to the stage
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet&#39;s surface and is being discovered now by the large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron are looking.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, the investigations intensified.
When the price of oil fell, in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was put aside, but now that the cases of the environment and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy there are always more and among these companies the ones that have always voted for traditional energy.
&quot;Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – the spokesman for a company associated with the US oil colossus has declared to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us&quot;.
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US energy commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is quite an important sign, considering that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed, they indicate a growing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology that is still at the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those from the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce power on a large scale, a technology with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas linked together.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, it could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping center and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in New York&#39;s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electrical energy, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that come close to the coasts, have invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008, and an investment of 35 million is planned for the 2009.
