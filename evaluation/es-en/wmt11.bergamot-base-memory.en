What does it count? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed SDG colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current coalition members ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary using the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councilors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least, they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"Rather I am a novice in Prague politics," said Councillor of Culture Councilman Lukáš Kaucký during the "collegueo" terminology examination.
And as far as the veteran politician was concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf hole".
"Possibly it's the only expression of all that you asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the wording chose six examples, particularly those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "greater golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "treason of the capital" and "shine".
Three councilors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get into these things or consider how the civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, supposedly Councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything to him; the only term he hit in the exam is "the greatest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucký, who immediately adds, “But rather I know it from the news.”
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councilor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon Plachý is revealed that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge obtained from the news, but does not employ such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no glossary so familiar to colloquial terms.
"I asked my teammates, but it really seems like we don't have anything like it."
“Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we play word games with names,” says the president of the ČSSD Praguense, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"In school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper tested the name and works.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), Representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated themselves before the deception elections during the party's patronage, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his companions.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the batons" seems to remember that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as it published in a pamphlet
Women considered to be witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually old, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "get" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer only."
“You don’t isolate healthy young women either, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa, Burkina Faso, is engaged in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a downside.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” the newspaper Die Standard warns of the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, Burkina Faso’s neighboring country, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman caught on in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul eaters always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that had allegedly been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic."
“To help him, he brought in shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, randomly chosen men and women were forcibly taken among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people in detention.
The Bakala tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, elderly and strong, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal tycoon" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just caught the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room apartment with separate second-rate kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions “incorrect and indecent,” recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, the date on which it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a gesture.
“Everyone says a thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalization testing laboratory.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to catch number.
"Rent 2011", can be read in a light button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly gives time or reading "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve usual problems, such as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the tenants’ mailboxes of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them in the cards an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting out," the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist respond, after briefly doubting.
Liberalization and the old mining floors of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated loud and clear by the vice president of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want new soil."
"I didn't even change the damn plate of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, for the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract by 15 December will also receive half of the February rental discount.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" undoubtedly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about forty or fifty people for rent in 2011," estimates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge must resolve the issue.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG said in a statement.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of the RPG Byty employees and a man on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rentals still don’t even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty’s residential portfolio, adding that the sloppy state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with rents invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stands out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most 7,50 Czech kronor per month per square meter," the screen said.
Only 38% increase in the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 kroner per square meter," says RPG.
At 2,600 apartments, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the increase in rent (see the graph) again in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rental increase agreement.
The architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with everything like such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous known buildings of Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-keddery store.
The company works around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and draftsmen to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-day-care shop was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-kardery is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the financing is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-kerey running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the financing application contributed to Economy Rating.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently accommodates children without an age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a "mini-garder", it can only simultaneously accommodate a maximum of five children, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the daycare is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use childcare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-nareship programme are comparable to the regular preschool education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school kids late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The bone house continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are reminiscent of a dinosaur's spine and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order are observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpent and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The wavy wood copies the window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes and signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, formed by several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project came ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and Gaudí’s Güell Park, in which other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction rules of the moment at all and was not allowed to influence them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the indicated data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impacted with the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection of space.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and more recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly befriend a resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How to choose the mattress and the box spring: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly so that they adapt to specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and the box spring are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly aerated and, above, they are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside. Even mold may appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very tall mattress with a soft coat and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep here as well."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes than time nervous system problems, so they get bad information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in quilted furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not go around like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also functions as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a possible visit to be comfortable too.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, a subject he teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own box box and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed soles at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with the interior of springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When touching it by hand or when sitting on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can’t wash their cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a dog.
Therefore, the vendors give a tip: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zipper are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opened they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for the beds designed for you to spend one night the visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For springs of non-articulable sheets and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a box spring with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lower back are reinforced and their stiffness can always be adjusted.
Articulable sheet beds should not be used with a spring mattress, since it does not react to recline.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around their hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are box springs with cross or slat structure with the so-called multi-torque cushioning.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "gritten"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) than shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool down" with breeze plant extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the sheath.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
The favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold foam and viscoelastic allows to manufacture mattresses of different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first one to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and bedstrips.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of the manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory memory foam attached to the case by 11,990 crowns.
The second is available for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cellular structure and a high density began with the "cosmic" Tempur material.
It initially emerged as a material for NASA, because during the takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for medical devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is approximately the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the means available to better protect her children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it's not about spying, but about another means to decrease the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns of the fact that if the child does not want to take him, he will simply throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled."
“Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bočková says.
In his opinion, it is debatable if in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check if the child carries any type of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now is the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, you will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The more expensive devices have a tilt meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” Čech says.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the moment these are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential assailant may not identify the device."
"Or to identify it after a certain time, which can make the police win time."
Although tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the entire Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to light explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of fuse to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the wick life is two years, four at most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million kroner.
General staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year also all the generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn’t want exempt or the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of wick.
Such length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained at the time recently to Minister Vondra because they say that they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also can't understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of wick."
"But it's their decision and they will certainly know why they act like this."
“For us, the military is a good customer who, as a company, we try to satisfy,” admits STV Group’s chief commercial officer, Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of wick, also saying that he will have stocks of this "ammo” for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the fuse only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
“If it’s stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, for possible criticism from the army, doesn’t want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, he obtained a discount.
"We cost 60% less than last year's 244 kilometers order," Defense Ministry spokesman Pejšek said.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of fuse of police pyrotechnics, who eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life is over.
They decided for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry is already clearly struggling to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: it will be necessary to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live off the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Empressor of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Empressor of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec you needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan bought a house that was half-defolio made up of five floors.
Considering he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“At present, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested again in the building, which gradually converted into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year it opened another one of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one entrepreneur last year.
“This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped win the ‘Empressor of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun said.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," she recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends that everyone want to try a company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He affirms that, so far, he continues to live off the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total around seventy.
"I've seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained overall recognition."
“It’s not, by far, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
“It’s just my name that appears on the front page,” Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already had the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the year", last year in the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” the winner said.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žďárský's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They obtained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year it may not have been a sample of victory euphoria at Farmet.
It also gained recognition for trade results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of such a situation either."
“The revenues were down by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some redundancies,” explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, reinforced the presence in the international market and obtained great valuations at national fairs,” says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues increase again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part for the fourth time of the business tournament.
He has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration was asking for an extract from the commercial record, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the impositions of the insured," ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová said.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny for the fourth time and begins to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers necessary for the tax return we are first of all global," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business standards has been a declared objective of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Chequia is in the 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first held in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives the most votes.
For this year’s survey, more than a hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that are meaningless.
Examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which is always made in early November in the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the Eva Svobodová competition, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the State continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to remove absurd regulations do not remain in borage water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the area of permanent operation, the intention to go with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third goes the vanquished.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physical therapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the year competition.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the Vodafone Empresa main contest of 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write a standalone article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, disabled people, other people with personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that is why he received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Empresa competition of the year he finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it buys priority from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The head of IT Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona scholarship in distress, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
They are also in good place with a mention the laundry company Praní a čištění from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year contest were automatically appointed and sent to the organizers before August 15.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the contestant companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the responsible Company of the year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the year contest."
"The individual applications for this contest are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main company of the year contest," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police made various arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that he intends to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the return of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by a precise interested party.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million kronor for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen general Antonie Zelená's chief prosecutor told Právo, adding that for the time being she can't release further details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá responded to Právo’s questions by saying that police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen’s headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"It's about a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Depending on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, then, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the greatest offer," the Fund's spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be submitted to the call and, since at the same time he is an interested person because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please charge a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on me.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Bottom for a long time.
He was listed in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some land planned for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Afterwards, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will be required to pay for additional expenses of several hundred kroner per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Therefore, families will have to remove several hundred kroners a month from the portfolio from January more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 more kronor per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore the higher consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundreds of more kronor per year.
While electricity and gas are risingly around the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay since January for the central heating about 50 more kroner a month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to support a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Prague people will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will become 7.4% expensive.
They can considerably increase rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in shape, because it does effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under fifteen years.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," Hořovice Hospital chief of pediatrics in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán, told Právo.
"When they manage to catch a bottle from their copseling father, it can be whiskey, but it's usually about Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and that it doesn't smell so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use brandy that they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers are those who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he worked from this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought with 3.5 blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at a dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, you cannot speak of dependence.
"Alcohol is understood as an alcoholic who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a social or family environment systematically failed," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe intoxication and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the street medical examination, go home to the parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink spirits, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that can be mentioned: the day of witches, the End of the Year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink by the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"On witches' day I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at a time," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is prevented by the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These take him much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"They only show themselves confusing about where they are," Pelikán says, adding that, often, patients lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients costs a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people so that you could earn enough to pay for that night," Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in the hands of others in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left for Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the Casa-EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time such a device has been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for traineeship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 cars.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sale intermediary, the Omnipol company, already took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when Vodochody’s planes will be physically removed.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for an amount of 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS pledged to have the planes added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and that will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a House aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry did not call a bid for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 overseas.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by placing a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three House planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annular one indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest rate than cancelling are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men aged up to 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right finger of the right hand shorter than the annular one.
They had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer rate than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with ages below 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "utterly demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most in Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow removal machines circulated overnight in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the Automobileovichus Ustředního (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck was damaged, in the 93 crashed two industrial vehicles that caused injuries.
Also several cars ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must travel slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated at kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
There have been jams of several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 °C.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three rapids.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from eleven o’clock on Wednesday night until five in the morning.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to circulation in Vyškovska, snow-languages are being formed in Brněnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Connections are closed so far: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfalls gradually refer in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is employing in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known for the time being solely by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that it "change the progress of the game" towards its victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol with extremely precise aim.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a multi-meter accuracy.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosives charge it contains actually functions as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when you throw your killer shower of metal chips, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer giant and its maintenance company communicated on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from its previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad neighborhood of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday provoked joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt’s head of economics section Markus Frank (CDU) said that he has earned a “Global Player”.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management previously informed the city about his intention.
"We have now offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the property owner at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change difficulties.
After all, the economic motives produced the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to fill in the famous outpost.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will show themselves cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part with the leftover buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project of the spa city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city council a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, investment counseling and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of Reserve Systems Software, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as Siemens then joined with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, native of Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
Wikileaks’ revelation platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
"Talk freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website to address the high numbers of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate’s security council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
"I had wished Amazon to take these measures before, before previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit server use in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate process of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspected rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard is aware of the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is feared for the safety of Assange, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the declarations of North America.
In America, former Republican Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Chief of Government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage duties.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy distribution director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed exceptionally commissioned, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms" that are necessary in light of Wikileaks' leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The Ice Cream College
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice creams are prepared at the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice creams has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Actually where does all the ice cream come from?
From gelatiere and gelata.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio takes out with a spatula the cream of the ice cream of the counter, spreads it over the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice creams has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in some years within an enervating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only their good taste, but also their silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they be dismissed from the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will attempt to strain aromatized ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, they must ever experiment."
Whether it’s with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Just because you know better it doesn’t necessarily depend on you having more tofe aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First a balanced blend highlights the flavor of ice cream, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a problem of arthymetic: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, you have to lower the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing but physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out in terms of small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrolled mini-primer.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa think tank on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Efsa testing rules of genetically modified plants, putting him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and imitate the company’s writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior Efsa manager went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU and industry inspection authorities, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as a clairvoyant EU parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, also some of the industry, are used, provided that they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” Then says.
Current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to meet?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For businesses, critical studies are not generally published.
“The industry controls safety research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As sealed, most of the wing became debris.
It rotates at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
Like he said once, he's smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old is dealing with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be disgrace, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the shootdown company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained that he could do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilo sledgehead cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also hoping to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have been sold for a long time.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If not for the political component."
He ascends to his SUV, takes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, is interested in computers and eventually works with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the country's greatest ancient stone dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Limestone dawn, yellow, warm, get excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the Mazizos belonged to the Stuttgart Neckarstadion Grandson.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone trafficker, also stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potentials
An active influx reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and carmaker Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of their students, they try to glimpse exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and the work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University takes the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: “Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience.”
"In turn, VW can meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 positions of vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognosis of the VDI, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone fell short."
For the Dykta scouts the notes give results.
"Until today we have similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized businesses, classic with their job fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, personnel manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies appear on the company’s website.
"It's being very difficult to fill the vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with the university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually cannot offer it," said Stübe, the person in charge of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible work schedules, assistance to children or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld holds 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the personnel in charge also expects extra points in her classification by her aspiring work.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
It advises your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is the employees themselves," he said.
In the jargon of the sector it is called internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify you with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a gang,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in a manner that was unappealable.
Also facing the Atlantic coast, new perforations remain closed for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in place for the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil rig in April.
Before the life-stricking misfortune of eleven workers and sparking the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to decrease U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day it has not been fully clarified of who is the responsibility of the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the critics is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different petroler consortiums submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher checks and tighter security regulations.
Currently the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into discredit, is reformed at the root.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative fiscal loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” the result of the current survey by the advisory company BDO – says ahead of Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what exactly changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonged to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is oil brown, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Before here I was taking shrimp to handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: Which, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered to be one of the most stinked regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will pull some full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with the smell of gas station expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says, sluggish, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is a fierce battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke out more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms stood out like quirky water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured in 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaky pipelines as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world conventional, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are "over a larger multiple than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flies: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire longer hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the vessel, later the oil pipe drips and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "It gives us 34,000 naira", around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "those of the bunkers", who tricked the network of pipes that Ogonilanda crosses: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil a day are lost throughout the Niger delta.
Only a negligible part of the stored provisional raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which also belong political and senior military officials, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or the loose way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed mainly by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special army unit takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
"This doomed invention has completely shattered our country," Akpobari said.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security issue.
In a machine investigation that made a crash landing, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers at the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those in the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a hard landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas’ director, said his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be spared.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, a spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
This double-deck aircraft is the world’s largest passenger aircraft.
Snowfall across the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany completely white: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: In almost the entire country, freezing temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered the chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
Germany’s Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported significant disorders in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on lanes or shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service treated the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snowwinds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information station, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 flights canceled.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: also here a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and dust-like and therefore swirling in gentle streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an item, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to cash in on the costs of the reship, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in project.
"We always check if it is advisable to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany again gives up the headquarters of its company after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor it has not been revealed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourning the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the site of misfortune, but it did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing glow of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the mine.
Together with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the borders of the genre with his epic of Battles "Walhalla Rising".
In what audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed imprisoned Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no word throughout the movie and the other characters get carried away by at most one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot dismiss each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-smattle hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more humor in the mainstream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and sprouting guts cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action are dying of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent missionary missionaries for interpretable reasons and becomes stuck an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hides, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
And that is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn only hits a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a young blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until checks are allowed.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the U.S. international intelligence service of the CIA of late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than for those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It was short time since the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly more well known than at that time, the enigmas became greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was completely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in summer lapidarily that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly unraveled from the rubble of the alleged "unusable military building" and raided the ground conscientiously.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors just after the attack, which must have a greater information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analyses.
Since then Damaskus refuses to argue about it, as well as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombed-out building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, by which the IAEA watches is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams to be the key to progress in clarifying, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not disclosed publicly so far which teams are dealing with, or what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as an inmate Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits for this reason entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record that the U.S. has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the teams thanks to U.S. Secret Service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three places and the cube to the shore of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a senior official in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” either of uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the bombs should be separated later, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEO considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their ability as an area for radioactive waste in 1998.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made earthworks at the three suspected suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence but it hardly contributes to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed down that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter does not have much urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, wields the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the coming nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For this most of the IAEA governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her still unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, bringing some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last moment.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of victims of the war wrote to UN High Commissioner UNHCR for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, she told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position about it betrays the victims enough about the script.
Her organization according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she is introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
Their content is still vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the net that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "victim of rape's victim's love as a torturer."
It's certain that Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still online illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream for joy as loud music rumbles, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South-Land's Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer scientist don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old is trying to have fun with it, to get distracted from the fulminating question, what will the future hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend awaits him in Auckland, "from a threw out he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor home prospects, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
The young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economics experts and Dublin’s ESRI social research institute.
Until 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the well-trained young Irish, for whom until now, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future appear because the government is only dedicated to montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies for getting new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
He observes how his colleagues go from an internship not reumned to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to running your career,” he said.
On his website, photos of one boy surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it entails freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O’Donovan knows what it’s like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
Now they're running a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, Hanover or Berlin are gone to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as a long time ago of the first time he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and goes for icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a credit.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times spent here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel for the first time like Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked for a couple of years in London and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend in New Zealand do?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he could degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Fired, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to march, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime raises greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, two related issues stand out.
The first is the relatively lively humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a 40% decrease in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 percent in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has stood during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increase in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic returns and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
About 31% say that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has fallen since 38% last year and that is the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 percent of respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the most leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to garbage
No one expected the general election held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners who tried to help the country to come back after their problems were feared.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that "we are not of the opinion that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The playoff is expected to take place in January.
Not all the hopes regarding the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic sweeps the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been circulated shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving on tiptoe to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has registered since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, that can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez ignores the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have confronted Mrs. Fernandez.
However, after a chaotic session in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied next year, which will offer the president an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the unions, put it about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for reason Mrs. Fernandez is signaling that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes around 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in politics when she ends her term, considering that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have declined.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether to repudiate or not, with peace of mind, many of your husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, went on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the progressive democratic party (PPD), which has been inclined to a total independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8 percent.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls of dancing clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor missing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public accommodation and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy on China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
No doubt, he would also like to achieve political integration, but first things first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass for it.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate of the PPD for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to create a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he claimed that the PPD candidates would have come out better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also conduct a conscience examination.
Mr Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of said artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made a breakthrough and, considering his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to success for Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated on the jazz field for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity," a thrilling and magnificent album that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident favorite in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy’s wild punk James Argue’s Secret Society gained well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the Billy Childs Ensemble’s great chamber jazz and the ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, “Pathways,” was a great example of the bassist’s democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Albums Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations went to Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his #4 symphony, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choir and solo albums.
The classic producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati"rus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt’s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to be played in mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African scales and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral status category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains approval from the ordering commission
The mosque project for Temecula has garnered unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of, often heated, public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it fosters terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha'i, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"They just talk very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was spent on people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty Dead in the Sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it has little to be a kind of really 'alien' way of life," Paul C said. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report featured in Thursday’s online edition of the publication Science.
For a long time, there have been six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable to life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not done by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on the Lake Monkey because it has elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Accordingly, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it does not work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it a little, it clumps the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact of demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be naturally a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in early Earth eras, he said, so researchers speculated that the first life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They've come back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s two-month tour participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer's brood, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the robbery of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while restructuring MGM gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to erase approximately US$5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the demands of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM being relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned 500 million dollar credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating credit, which on its own is contributing 75 million dollars, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management needed to sort their finances, while struggling to make interest payments for 300 million dollars a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy business recovery expert, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than 2 billion dollars that creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received 1.2 million dollars, will get a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising US$375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a “successful hours” of US$4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which released only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films coming out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in a deal.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of their gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five 99 dollar BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same thing and even a little less compared to last year’s.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the toys powered by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and older) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-changer games like Simom Dice, and can make the lunar passage, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are an 80’s child, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise notebook happening.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo (US$60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and the easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (US$70, 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major set-up of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words by placing the blocks in a row before time is over; it is formidable for an improvised speech-arming competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog’s mouth.
More moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing quietly orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the burly policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their whimsical crackdowns and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed their teens with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, conscionably.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a discolous snack cart, and watched it with a frown constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth, to its urban police.
The idea is to give the cough police a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s tiny respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby killed after using his cell phone to film them while they were disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, which described how to effectively whip criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a watermelon street vendor from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a scuffle with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” said China Daily, a national publication last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say the current approach is a long way from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had royal duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district’s notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They had to have a height above average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female Chengguan are like vases, she said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city’s administration office, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that height demands were standard in many Chinese job warnings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not present itself.
"We can't allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her look is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our job should present the image of the city."
They also don’t oppose their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor bigger career ambitions than simply scaring away vendors in the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors throwing themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many muffins or tofu bowls as possible before they are thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn car with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made their way to their elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said quite naturally.

Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exculpated Senator John Ensign from the criminal allegations that emerged from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the wife’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said he was “surely happy” with the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have colluded to violating a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, email and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton work and advocated for them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethic experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens, amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them."
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to charge his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a US$96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, reached out to Hampton and told him he was "slacking" the Interior Ministry over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When affairs news first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department’s example and conclude its investigation.
"Sen. Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire appeal to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the judge’s imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court briefs outlining the arguments for appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports of the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by journalists of mass media, created "an atmosphere of circus", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“As I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair process,” Thomas J said. Ullmann, senior defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark ruling in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later could be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable in the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, John J said. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential juries, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pushed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract most interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually fueled the fire of emotion about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe statewide.”
Your attention on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, were a Luddite view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said the appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not make any progress on the big issues that should be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences of the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a probationary period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeness and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
Reason why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent assessments of it by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate changes that have existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, spending, health care or social assistance, the two parties are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed with regard to how things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t believe they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefit for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s White House meeting, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112do. Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders have in the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they should try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
Those party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut in expenses.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that number.
The increased resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that in fiscal matters there are, at least currently, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will happen next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing will probably change course and seek commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990’s, and there appears to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames it for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean-up since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such allegations.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection’) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report claims that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while money collection is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, inside the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem's Moscow think tank, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of power, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than US$300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy’s note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is fixing the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously over a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face past
In a concrete, weakly lit classroom, with stained and shelled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court in the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol-led government, the remains of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last move that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the 1996 Ieng Sary surrenders, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the older Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the raso soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have made little profit after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-sufficiency."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This doesn’t help much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers are thought to have died.
During a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court called her, she would not show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, though experts and historians question him.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its uranium reserve qualified for weaponry
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it looked like they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of operations classified with Belarus have been carried out in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapon-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the issue.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weaponry) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detente.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not qualm CIA flights
The Spanish government did not qualm CIA flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised an appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of anti-human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had caught the Zapatero government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," Aguirre says in a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors,” rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the defense ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the U.S. government."
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "hargoon" of being a mother
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she uses since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruñés town of which she is a native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of his relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, soon after it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It didn't take long to meet him another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him he became a long term to live together.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the child stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and he writes: "Alberto is very rare and skinny, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it was good, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants."
Then, talk about a message to the mobile that has just received: "I want you to turn this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about the return to his people: "This week I'm going to there, but I'll only be until 19, because on the 20 I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well for him, he takes his firstborn.
"It will be with whoever he owes, that is, with me, and I will never in life think to leave him again with anyone other than my mother," he doubts his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When he types it, the boy, who arrived on the island on 1 of that month, is supposed to have been killed on 10, is dead.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand it's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
It talks about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the kid) to a summer class, and so I save a little bit of kangaroo pasta."
17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, see how when he wants me, you have to fuck up."
On 30, another: "The child is fine, goes to summer classes for him to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages from him on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the releaser."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, sworn-keeper, declares her sorrow for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday in the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor have he intended to cause any evil to the child."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor requested psychiatric proof.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights on the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would verify that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the Provincial Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages more budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not get a majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be far-fetched for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the votes need to be obtained - .
The PP has increased its vote figure in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of being able to star in the overturn in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has placed only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by agents of the General Police Information Police Station in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the counterfeiting apparatus of al Qaeda at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "combatants" can cross the European and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in EU territory they will be carried out in the coming days blows similar to that developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt
These were the ones who directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists of passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation it is stressed that, for the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Mumbai, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP demands that Mas park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already proposed during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philo-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equador of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself loved, since the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstains in the vote of investiture.
From a possible understanding with the PP depend on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independence speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thin the political apparatus of a very inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be occupied by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elders
Those responsible for the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsibles."
And it is that in addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the guard, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, attending to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures may not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the case there is no single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself.”
The already baptized "Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by pricking him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime that committed it by helping himself with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center has access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that must clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she burned them inside giving them bleach as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the guard, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that warned “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral spreads have closed sharply and shares of European banks are up more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What has occurred yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the ineffective public debt purchase plan and eliminate all extraordinary measures of term liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond purchase program and even signal to step up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be object to withdraw liquidity measures, may God assist us!
As at their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a further market crash.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has not enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension for the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which a political commitment is necessary to show that we are a union and that we all touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, double that of the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing ability.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity triple that in March, to expensive rates and you close access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, it seems so."
Cheer up, we can.
Eulen president to challenge Vega Sicilia board asked for by his children
The temporary does not amaina in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, considering it "null and void", the judicial board of El Enebro on day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors it was downloaded by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders’ meeting of January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Magistrate of the Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and clean up the radically null meeting of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the board, once the board has been held, to proceed to its challenge, considering that it is "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and head of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the contestation application is held, for which there is still no stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull stormed the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a new arrival team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high motorsport.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or the process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during racing and in testing.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
180 young high-skilled professionals work in the Red Bull team today, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications in the fireballs.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull balloids with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from virtual simulator reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its fireballs in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists hide whose contest is invaluable and its notoriety null.
The chief technology officer of the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that the advances of R&D in cart cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will reconcile this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located in the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with commission increases and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private clients, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without resorting to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the recruitment of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, their great pending subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks dare in these times to set themselves some objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its master plan Optima, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, while he believes that the liability war — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their issuances for liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a factor of credit pressure."
"We have not closed the tap, but the spreads are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the spreads -see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, he assures that in Spain "they will require larger sizes."
"Next year everything is going to move," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "highly raised" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial entity enters red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in the raising of funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of mergers of savings banks will occur and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there is are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which in that has collaborated a lot as well," said the director.
Speaking during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain, "he emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volumes to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The executive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have sparked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How do we interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany speculation is beginning to be speculated about the three possible outlets to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the transgressive countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government took out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what their European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel emerges again with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union’s treaties, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist the process of reform of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not plan to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although now we have to take measures with which perhaps he does not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro, it will be finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The envite is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about driving the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis has been opened that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded from unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
So, Germany can always tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tretas like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly concocted by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to finish the match (which their team already had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when it comes to taking two fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that on past occasions it has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions commit fraud of law; for, in effect, they are actions respectful of sports regulations, but they seem to avoid their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that the sporting spirit comprises is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is referred to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking advantage of the opposing team unfairly, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage infringers gain in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the opponent is not disadvantaged or profited in the same match, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is an advantage in the long term, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated to the first of change, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty match and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it’s not so clear that it’s an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is a part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case that concerns us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and fraud of law is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical and aesthetic.
Offer offensive to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for days 16 and 17.
Self-paid celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, proliferate.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise the oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to attract the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector agreed.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (at New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already been the case since 2008, when the stage of skinny cows began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budget matters.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of 17 is observed.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done our best to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover from the second half and a good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that precelebrate the holidays.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employers’ association Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are “animated”, although the customers “negotiate to the maximum”.
Of course, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, whoever pays, he says.
Pakistani nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country."
WikiLeaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlighteners and juicy details they offer about the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of atomic security, instead of increasing, "declines", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - which the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
This is listed by the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is contemplated, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and reason to keep the guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with their U.S. counterparts.
The latest from the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the diminishing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls the communication with Pakistan "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are left unanswered or are dismissed."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end the tacit support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the moves and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow Assange's movements."
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Moreover, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens said: “Police people know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange.
It was on the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
The 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, do consider the so-called free-hand-free notice network for arrest — which the national police force must undertake — especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This seems like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an undetermined interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt of President Barack Obama’s spokesman to downplay Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help.”
Further has still been Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should “be killed.”
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a drone or something."
Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for president, was not apologized.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to circumvent the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his friend of resignation is insufficient for the like-minded of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that at all it can cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
Through ballots, and not by freehand.
If the carodists want to vehiculate a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand the president more than put his position at the disposal of the militants, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But not having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap from now to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will vote for a vote on the national council on 18.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for the fact that this promises to advance the congress to autumn of 2011, something that the leadership already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make, once and for all, the organization able to wash the dirty rags from doors in.
In this line, the article that the acting councilor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the membership, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC once liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows to hold the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive 2008 conclave left the task to the management to review assembly in a specific charter reform congress.
This appointment is still pending, because the internal tide of recent years discouraged facing the matter.
Now, without sectors critical of the lurk, it can be a good time to pick it up and try to close it forever.

China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its supply to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, said.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community on that matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all those areas, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities, to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it abounded, are underway or have already concluded various multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent sources for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the country’s government on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than what is generally thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution in pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do another both by 2020, he abounded.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate for his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former panista leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is convenient for his right.
In an interview prior to the protest takeover of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, where appropriate, by complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will have to be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The panista leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the contary "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that undoubtedly the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be an observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that it comes out of the closet," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag or much less censorship.
Obama on Twitter promotes law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass this legislation," the U.S. president tweeted on the popular social media.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the vote of the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to come soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extent of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is passed.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote on debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, requiring the contest of a handful of Republicans, as party organizations of the bill star in intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act require adding up to several Republicans should other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Utah’s Orrin Hatch and Texas’ Kay Bailey Hutchinson but have stated that they won’t back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants displayed the narrative
"That sex in the language I understand but ... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, he explained).
The finger in the sore ... "puts us in trouble", the Argentine writer sweetly told the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what is the "sore", goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers although yes clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he comes out convinced: "patience is not my forte, maybe it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the aisle, but who clarifies that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the open real, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the open real and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very interesting.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narrative that Elogio of invention titled, where the finger in the wound is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With strokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who the same touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, narration that she turned to speak America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning her own chroniclers who told her and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretend witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was missing even modesty."
However, he highlighted "it is the madmen and the liars who imagine best" and that is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
It is actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is counted."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero narrowed down and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers to the great wound of social violence that crosses her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that result in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To own our thinking and own reality we have to nuance: and nuance it means many times to put the finger on the sore and annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about cartoon, black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano is going for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the runner-up medal, he has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as coach in the Apertura 2002 Tournament, when he was in the reins of Morelia with which he fell by global of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost him with a 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, since his team finished tied 2-2 against the Sluts after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty run he took the lead 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players missed from the 11 steps and suffered the flip 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous final, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we were already prepared to run out and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we left, that we left, that we did not leave
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and wait time.
From January 10, 2011 the procedure of processing a visa will change at the U.S. Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to Visa Applicant Service (ASC) centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa cases with petition (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas of merchants and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as being in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist on par with ours and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found in the bottom of the Monkey Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way of surviving and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will release the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s Thursday press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn’s greatest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition 'block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislasture was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the Chamber.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it begins 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition is over.
"So far (the opposition coalition) has arrived, it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and for that reason they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, having been monopolistic, now is "duopolical."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to be more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'loot' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're handing it out between two."
Patrón Montalvo, asked for respect for the personality of the deputy, his place is given at the negotiating tables.
"That not by domestic agreements, we leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pays Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed and, therefore, how many checks are left to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"You haven't bought anything, you're just paying you what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not reused their services.
The above, after on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he charged checks for more than 3 million pesos.
They are urged to serve tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs are mourning a foreign tourist accident due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take the return to nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they did not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because by giving preventive maintenance and not falling solely into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"No due attention has been given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious by everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites from Mazatlan, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put us online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Calls for IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the State Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and one more of the PVEM, which totals 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will carry out the Ruler in turn.
"We make sure that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push for economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation."
Regarding tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he is taking within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of Tourism state.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with agro industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourism projects and that they help to give security to the state and in the update to the Alcohols Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A magician is wanted
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please his illusions, since his home is made up of nothing more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family inhabits a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and they live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Well, sometimes we see it hard because my husband does not have a chamba, but we sell mandarin and potato ... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Elizabeth, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a monster car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because I was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Find a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various accusations.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the network’s two alleged leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke City Hall in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession in order to traffic, plot and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
Around seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It can fight against clandestine migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill that the government says should solve the problem of pateras loaded with clandestine migrants is likely to face great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I base myself mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite you step on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he would not be able to back the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
Immigration criticism by the NPD, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism at the helm that her party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that action is taken against the man in charge of the clandestine boats and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs. Chow.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for a minimum of one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs not to tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a doormat.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each deputy who will oppose it will later explain itself to its constituents.
The new unit does not get unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation is a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Consequently, Tuesday’s announcement caught more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit pulled from the hat" and as "a last-minute sloppy solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public poll.
"The more Mr. Charest obstinates about avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests to Quebec that he grant a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the controller the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only budding project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments under this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to the biker groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfalls add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s civil security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit is still on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec flood forecasting center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their rude radio language.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day”.
The Council also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into questioning "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, in this respect, any fault has been dismissed.
The latest litigation concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media showdown that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of greatest audience within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
"In my case, I look for combat everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the ground play involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championships, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won in the kickboxing full contact and thai box categories," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009."
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which he is allowed to strike with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who has beaten me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face off in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth 450 million dollars to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5,000 million dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender being previously carried out.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"That is, the people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly," Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the national assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can benefit in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
"I start to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "lack of rigor" way.
He noted that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortiums is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In the whole case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the formula of the consortiums has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is under investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec’s business record allows you to identify more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has been specifically responsible for it since the 1970's".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of his participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to US$ 449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of US$ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or green certificates to guide their choices.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they swarm messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down its commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates carried by products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the gaps and the doubtful nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to dispose of this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged returns of organic products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and especially changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer says.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be on the doorstep (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of the bicycle and walking trips.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which they have asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard and return their true cinéfila vocation, they have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would in fact be lower than initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million last spring, but since then applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He has sent him one last report a dozen days ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
El Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely dismissed.
Remember that the Association of owners of cinemas and film complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do demand considerable financial assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried for ten years the load of the author cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of theaters for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, promote a private financing campaign, hoping to raise 700,000 dollars to make their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these theaters, the Parallèle, continues to screen films in eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted complex...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians’ complex with respect to Americans, but reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than truly substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is, during the middle of the federal election campaign, relates the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This provoked great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think about when voting."
You can also see this sentiment of importance the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d’affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their trip will contribute to ensuring the government’s survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will register deficits for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars,” writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from replacing the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image transmitted by the drama series broadcast on the CBC of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct strong interrogations.
Another cable says that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that he depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the mood has been warmed in relation to the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "murdered."
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major projects concrete that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode (DEL or "LED" bulbs, much of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that needed to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations about fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers are instructed.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"Calls on all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let the Wednesday-midnight deadline go by without the results being released, three days since Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CEI president had told television that the commission "kept working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls have multiplied in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has been annulled by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director for the president of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation maneuvers of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
Now, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from spreading the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivory Coast political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in the mainland (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (SVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they seek employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
There has been only unemployment stability among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006 the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, after a controversy about its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) on Tuesday, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Investigated and Detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of public funds and property, cover-up, active corruption, influence smuggling and ammunition possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions posed to him by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he must manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
Within the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been investigated since Wednesday, for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been left on probation and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were questioned and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking of influence and passive corruption.”
Two Aubagne agglomeration officials, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and embezzlement of public goods by a person engaged in public service" and for "complicity in embezzling public funds" respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of the abuse of social property.”
Among those who have confronted Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several court instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the Aubagne waste, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Elyseum has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has had the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice system for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously release" into the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of prison from Clotilde Reiss (which will occur on August 16, the day on which he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is released: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition was requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like numerous observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which nears Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
To release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
The Eliseo, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot overturn the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee spares no effort, uses communications and "leaks" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and verify that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
Next, the document addresses the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise that it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elyseum.
In a statement, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius who have played an "active role in favor of the release of our countryman."
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family said.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the bill's ministry chief.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he says.
The government also considers asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people request it, added the person responsible.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow limiting the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
Amid the storm sparked by suspected corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appoints the countries that organize the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence-influenced and lobbying can come to a primate over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Cross-frame transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) nominations have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too important for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the stake on Monday by releasing a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dislike FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have jumped into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful blow by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the JJ.OO organization for London in 2005. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to recover England’s brightness to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also have numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they manage is to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorites.
The world’s leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of paid TV rights (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had implied that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always be felt that it is doubted.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It just conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he talks about the presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this type.
"At worst, or better, of the cases, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think I'm thinking what's coming next."
His claims yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They arouse comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy on the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has climbed the stage that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather on the contrary, the fact that his 2012 candidacy is evident is what leads many people on the PS to claim that the battle is organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon’s candidacy for Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of state letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of solving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say if he considered that the central bank should do more, increasing for example its program of purchase of state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans" ...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the program of purchase of State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury obligations by the ECB has doubled last week to close to 1.350 million euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities for an amount of 67,000 million euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt the least that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes of course.
Although loan operations more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to continue today for a few months.
"I can't imagine you're going to significantly modify your program."
“If not, it would risk causing new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, an economist at the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," said Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations so that the market remains stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in returns paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager.
Because, if interest rates turn through the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb of the rates of 10-year obligations.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Upon the departure of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and that an "unpredivisible" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
If anything, on Tuesday the gap with German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of hedge contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being reviewed in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (up from 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7,000 million euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be adopted," Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a no-confidence motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of reason would be opened for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and by day, that the Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the rates of the obligations of European States has boosted the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries intensify the debates to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the existing crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this taking into account also the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
Regarding the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EFF title issues are expected to be made next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative has told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through additional direct commitment from the IMF.
With regard to the countries on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider indispensable to increase confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of public bond markets.
In passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around an additional 100,000 million euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with 60,000 million euros.
A council that could undoubtedly examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in Ile de France.
Layers of snow between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, the Isle of France and Lemosin.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to various departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, has been banned.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be driven except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measure had been planned Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Parisian airport in Roissy and 10% in Orly on Thursday because of the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south London, and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the Ile of France has reached its peak, it rains billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro that must be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euros.
On the theoretical level, this sum will be the one that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 rectifying finance law, examined in the National Assembly’s finance commission this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices in the Ile of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euros of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that they will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the exposition of reasons.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised are not listed in the credit, can provoke a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandaly in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation it belongs to) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khaddafi's sinisterly ridiculed profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in the occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little craving) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same one published by the Newsweek the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the Heads of States can call themselves or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer who watches research movies knows it perfectly, we just pretend we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "executioners".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In the past, in Orwell’s time, he could conceive himself of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is now the case, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer retain its own secrets endure?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secrecy, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put on the network any reserved information, since it would be like publishing it on a street poster.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to hold confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved by plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in errands with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a cable telegraph (telephone).
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the montage, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to advance or back from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the trips it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly being plotted in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France’s slops on its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked (called fast-tarf or early) financing pledges made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French slops have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing US$ 30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute 7.2 billion euros in three years and France 1,260 million euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2,200 million euros in 2010, which puts it on the right path towards fulfilling its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years in fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, the costs of previous years and the total level of official development assistance are not referred to.
Specifically, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while seeking to meet its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making a 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it for its own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France double abuses: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why did the other Member States go to continue donating when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not dumb...
The early financing chapter is a relatively short-term minutia in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of extra sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not.
Whatever it may be, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move forward with discussions on gambling on long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of “additional character” or the method of counting loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is to others.
We therefore have hope for the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The stock of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to acting as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded on an individual basis, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is of concern," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even the loaf of bread or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, salmon slice was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk generated by these “pollutant cocktails” to the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europa Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
