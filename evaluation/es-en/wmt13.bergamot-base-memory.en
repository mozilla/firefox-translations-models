A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy of the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people dying from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 election, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to file an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of scrutiny, and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no American state demanded that voters present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities were quick to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, the authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to file a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with such characteristics.
But often obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people who earn less than 35,000 dollars a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's even more.
In many states students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004 no state required citizenship testing to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
Those measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 percent of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for 13 percent of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, account for only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was partly possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the filing of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting tested or not doing it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes has erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is a more than sufficient reason to make men doubt, already reluctant in themselves, about whether or not detection tests should be done.
Take the test or not?
We have asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States detected a large rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret that data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between the patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at age 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% of the chance of suffering metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat non-life-threatening prostate cancers, in which case you should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive or a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We determine more and more often precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remain the best way to reduce the risks of the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophagus, pancreatic and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer."
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of suffering colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, another was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Moreover, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other’s family concerns and history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a huge commotion last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is partaker of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What’s more, it’s about the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or less “bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem few. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate that rule and don’t try too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who obey the principle of Pauli wisely.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories that, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", for which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it might be underlined here, they are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, from infrared, from ultraviolets, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide down the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the large hadron collider is a 27 km-circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don’t: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself attached to a refrigerator door.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can they" bring all of those investigations? asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For their part, many fervently want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes of the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research in our day to day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
To see: in the early 60’s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They swayed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who made the first continuous laser (the first was pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "lab apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light picker in 1969 in the course of his optics research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate must be resumed soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two-year breath.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've already been like this seven," he says, a pass, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived at the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in the face of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who dedicate attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for diarrhea to heal me, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to their childhood, for certain people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he said.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “healing” care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes left in this life,” she says, before accepting that she is put on a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a final visit of his son living in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps feeding.
They are palliative care that they are given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we know we'll all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether on a physical, emotional or spiritual comfort level.
The dying man is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar rate.
Death is part of the everyday.
We served a beer to Mr. Last night. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," said Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who are sick with cancer," she said. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to the care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the home palliative care society of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack in Quebec’s health care that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to address the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulated to demonstrate his opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it is agreed to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," she says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pains without having done what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients wish to die just because they do not receive proper care."
And in parallel, many oncologists are obstinate with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already under minimums when he left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
The Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request to die thank their caregivers who have not been treated in their demands once they have been relieved of their pain thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of their death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
The conduct of this report has been made possible by a journalism grant from the health research institutes of Canada.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP businessmen, fundraisers from political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
An "industry" that went too expensive to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It's funny how the system is pulverized once we've hunted big media," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former head of the Montreal police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into the embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved itself a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while waiting to come to "demonstrate the existing ploys behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of controllers, researchers and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "the Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made the "sewerage cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded with the serial registration of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, third city in Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin have been formally charged, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to right and right during the 2000s, awarding more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to the developers in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% of the election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the guilty."
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that doubtful practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned about the role of the "politicians who are informed of the ploy".
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete revision of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: "we can not fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-by-day advance beside you.
The technical staff has also provided me with a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a match, that's easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't heat myself.
From my beginnings in the preformation center of INF Clairefontaine until my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Those drafted this summer are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it their all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is supported by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like it in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away the position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth round in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
On an economic level, PSG is dedicated to its means for this project to be realized.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we took a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year he'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have accepted it completely.
After we won 4-0 at home Troyes, still meeting things to blame for us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to launch a game project.
A team is built on time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better let's say we have a "Zlatandependencia."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the Star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams that he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all of us to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playtime.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the team.
It's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is because today we have exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
Quite the opposite of current, central bank-based monetary exchanges, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the quotes are registered on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s not impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency,” “vying for the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both book depositors, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file chopping, that is, transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the 100th, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "giant sales" were launched.
“30,000 dollars were changed,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes quite a bit in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, equals a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in merchants, who do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to supply an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to re-evaluate the various risks, today considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond hills planted thanks to the French credits, was made in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to resell them as plots of land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid for mobile phones. The television and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have big fans throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, suppressing the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country depends on foreign aid from the 50’s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a ruined country after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining riches.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excapt the immense buddhic site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the country on which imports and exports are widely dependent, to restore their normal relations.
French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These works, sweet to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of lawsuits written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forces in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to the Assembly to finish its work.
And it has been almost two years since Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embroils.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "track on the right."
On the part of his supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organised in the next 15 days.
A very short span of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their draft of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimation while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist for the most part, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As expected, the articles voted have been unanimously.
Commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia law constitute the main source of law”.
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider that it is nothing more than an advertising ruse.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm his conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be quite less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of marital status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are the civilian judges competent to rule above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that there are few compared to those that were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the military's wish, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Civilian prosecutions in military courts will also not be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also expressed concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to leave last night on television, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are being expected by the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why Israel should visit.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the nets full.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Praetorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgota, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress was what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC. C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who engage in climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Even there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
In one trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Scrolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Art Museum in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha museum-bathroom, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily holds even those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend courses treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you are traveling to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not advisable to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shéquels (currently 1-3$.8 shequels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
It's actually from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shéquels and for this price you can travel by transhipping for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new workweek begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, flakeless fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is offered a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a great variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities you don’t see stray dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk to their liking” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The purrers love the crowded places and do not reject the treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will go out for 15 shequels a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The big and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law would bring on the mandatory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who trade with "false" certificates
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
From December 1 a law enters into force, according to which each working immigrant must take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language should even be confirmed to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centers will operate under the Swiss Language Institute, the People’s Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, managed to make this question to the press many times: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries,” confirms the Chief of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be upset, little boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and buying them what is necessary for the school.
When they reach adolescence, these kids venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders point out an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
Counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: to fire gunfire during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which to squeeze seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun possession law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy.”
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "meaningless rigor" be desisted.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior were committed, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to address the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting weapons orders
The first, "vestige of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials are included.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditatedly set to cover the fault," a former military official said.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
“Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute rope-under-string weapons, including Moscow’s,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to “illegal archaeology”.
The dependent of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal bulldozers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two magazines," he says
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be met, they make test purchases to illegal arms traders," he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "corner" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out just there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store’s dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get there, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that his daughter had fallen out of her daughter."
I can even get a couple of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I won't give him away.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "not everything".
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military said.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, is not offered a hare cat: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal encounters.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the “Buy a Gun or Machine Gun.”
There users place their orders and put questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"I buy a TT gun. Moscow," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and two-handed captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to let him know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary "The Right to Arms," Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and two-handed captures those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
You must wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics from the ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of anti-low-wage protests has been initiated in the Walmart corporation’s supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast-food chains, such as “McDonald’s,” “Burger King,” “Taco Bell,” “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.”
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it has destined to lose strength and dawn in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by Walmart workers and those from the fast food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some Walmart corporation workers, who employ 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, game rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the largest supermarkets.
That’s why many underpaid Walmart workers buy only at work.
Product availability and assortment have made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation 3.2 trillion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than what you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the pay raise on consumers’ shoulders, each store visit will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12.39 dollars more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say the protest took place in nine states alone and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than “another public relations stunt,” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the Walmart department store (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and that is why for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal law and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive 8.90 dollars per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few were the ones who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the fast food sector, workers’ unions be created.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing labor movement activists with arguments and layoffs.
Moreover, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the staff.
Discordants
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the McDonald's rally near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians, notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support fast food workers to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the biggest such manifestation in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy"
The issue of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier in the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and subsequently, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group in the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes it touches it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Even though Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world must be freed from our computer science, the physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can not be considered a panacea, you are waiting to resolve the question of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for device control in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda to you?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be really hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you lacking in resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects the human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for the frames per second to be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second is the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible tuning fork sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- From what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Doesn’t it seem to you that, from the standpoint of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all your time holding a smartphone up in your hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is what your strength is in (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the octave might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in support quality for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared towards bringing tangibility to these “images in the air.” For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to what one feels if someone was blowing it into the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make you think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space thinks that he goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes the work with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front of them, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from the top down, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosopheric storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg’s avant-garde from the late 80’s – early 90’s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and lifts everyone the mood.
Recently, he took an organillo in his hands and became the organillero of St. Petersburg, since he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to the appearance and the image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at a conversation starting.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with those after those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who took "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined in the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together at your art clinic... - For me it was important to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our regular employees and customers went there.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One may be popular but very little cultured.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the currentness and occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns everything is smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by clothes, orienting themselves externally, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person should not even be given the hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organillero. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simplons others.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to like them all.
Now we have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they're coming in the thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which usually people end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: a culture officer.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When kings were right everything was otherwise, kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level to properly evaluate them and make their way.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a st. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says the head researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to address reproductive problems in space with flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were not different in any terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophilics.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks randomly flipped.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will travel in the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was spent by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
There are few of us, astronauts are counted who after long flights have found everything well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In zero buoyancy conditions, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his native element.
The small men-amphibious seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity is necessary.
In the weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles are decrepted very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, trusting in the action of stimulants for childbirth.
It can, of course, be given birth in a special camera, it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear it in a special workout suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally misfit person," said Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
UNHO Chief: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limps.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," the current situation describes.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb businessmen with inspectors. Is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in any way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, not the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, within the framework of which the legislation concerning public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to perform about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regularizes how public awards should be organised, followed by existing legislation in each country and, then, the practice itself.
We have brought it all together and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely a common control of this type could contribute to us stop investing efforts in the realization of the laws, reducing and improving limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economy means getting a right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because we reduce the limit of the awards means that we will get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papering", that those who want to look for system failures will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, like the NKÚ, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the competencies are to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not usually like to draw a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be pinpointed exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That's sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparison.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it were not so, it would not be any benefit to collaborate with our office, do you think?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is their incidence manifested in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we perform ex-post checks, some delay is required.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you think that the passage of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each unrespected law on public procurement meant violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to tighten the law in this way?
I think not this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path leads us.
The prime minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb businessmen with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if prohibited, then not even the prime minister of government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but it can't say we'll do like we're doing anything.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict as to how formally action should be taken. This is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly passable
In various places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, in some there should be extreme caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, in the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to information from the control center of operations of the roads of the region.
The R6 fast track and the top-notch road in the region are now walkable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to exercise extreme caution, especially on some bridges whose surface can be frost and slippery.
Also, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with traces of ice and rammed snow.
Road attention needs to be increased, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow cover may have formed on the tracks, reports on its pages the Road and Highway Direction.
Road workers warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše Mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of rain-off snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although caution should be exercised and time-consuming will need to be adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some pathways could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to exercise extreme caution, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most top-notch roads is dry and ice-free.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, it is also warned of stretches with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less traveled tracks in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will find themselves with partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow was still left in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers removed the snow overnight; on the Šumper road about three centimeters of snow accumulated, according to the track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorske will find medium snow discarded in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the Šumper road administration confirmed today to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also went to the Jesenická their colleagues and, after the chemical treatment, the clues of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are walkable without restrictions, in the road of Šternberská drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still humid.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
At the moment there have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news that we like to grab on.
The music group The Tap Tap we like to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoiding the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the World, Canceled".
Nowadays it is very popular on YouTube, can you hear in the charity concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
She will be sung by all performers at the same time at the three concerts.
The anthems will link together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the starring role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world go to?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we carry out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not that hard how it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned from, everything came out without problems.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it remains uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair by elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been created that strives to thematicize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take an example from more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that perfecting and improving the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers arise, it will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedličkův ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we left a little of our hands (laughs).
However, popularity did not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we were quite helped by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We conclude that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done otherwise.
The show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is cautiously welcomed and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the early 1998 year?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t help.
Anyone who has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, canceled"
The objective of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Prague’s Jedličkův ústav, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech kronor.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission in the option of early sale in Bohematicket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of European Space Agency country ministers held last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth ESA member. It is the second ESA member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland initiated intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the A conference. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named himself to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the dresin or for braking.
The information about this dresin is limited to the one collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile techniques projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, from the teacher. M. Subotowicze, it was proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a heyday of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a heyday of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, the space available for volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum heyday in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law working social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in the labor cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "provokes a decrease" of the price of the competitor in order to take most of the market and, thus, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This whole situation promotes the total disinterest of entrepreneurs for paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is universally so well known that there is no need to submit specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes of the laws in force.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictation of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with the increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot be sustained by their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of help already reaches a million.
Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
Such a scandal was made public related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
Savings measures from virtually every southern EU state lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate like in the 19th century or to survive with a lousy wage at the edge of society, hoping that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Do you need to ask yourself where it comes from?
In the event that it is other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to satiety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by intruding on control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its egoism in political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is this: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation as the one described by Appiános in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long been disintegrating and the administrations were forcibly occupied."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people went to the polls with the vote spoken out in advance" ... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls" ... "He began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Although Appiános thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, just as in seniority, is that today’s society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual profit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of the time, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really demolishing fact is that the current elite completely ignore the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other avenues to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Lab of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have arisen, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right to self-defense and pigeonhole the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I don’t want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look at discovering who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small land area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is in the front row.
In each era we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack by Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschilds' Bank of America central bank, began during the War of Secession to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd grade.
The first war was set as the goal of eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the land by half a million to a billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution)
The method with which the group of the wealthiest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always carry a worsening situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the year 1907 was not repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, in the wake of it, the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare for the terrain of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflicting situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for the Germans to serve the solution of the Fuehrer, who was strong and simple enough and pointed to culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that he had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, that he lit the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to the Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it’s hard to tell if Hitler pulled too much of the rope that the international bankers initially tied him to or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers were to succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim on the front lines, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Take as an example how the supporters and detractors of Israel are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the world economy
In what light the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994 are now shown: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it forces everyone, small and big, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, who adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Movie Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive outlook: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently further intensified with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director and actor Ben Affleck's film "Argo" tracks an episode of this story, which garnered a small hit for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this a covert story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
For the lie to seem truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez’s memories.
The Affleck film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, moods are combined. We found well-documented sequences from Tehran on the one hand. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: sucked men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the halls of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Likewise, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran "wheels" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on fictional scenes (the impostor team at Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages pretty well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything does not come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks in the airport in Tehran, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its runway become crazy).
Argo’s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, by far, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the Affleck film loses a little dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70's.
But let it collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services may be, is sufficient.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"We came up with it after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were getting ahead of better prices on life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop may be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU’s contested regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shades the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the term "smear butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of either commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise non-homenoized national standards to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s U.S. prescription that in the inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applicable to the use of mother-of-greats by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the Macedonian name. In order not to hurt Greece’s sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Afterwards, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which meant a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage due to the fact that we have no sea.
We asked the European Union for compensation," then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in the autumn of 2004.
He argued with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the subject of criticism, the EU's efforts in regulatory matters and, likewise, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have the sensitive fibre, as well as other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beets.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the marzipan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the pot of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops of Ž
As protected EU maras, you will be able to be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Mr. Senator, how did you think of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were good in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age are increased.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have of changing things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out on the way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
To this is added the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
For this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guide craft to be recognized as autonomous work, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either right or left, is purposely rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have the greatest potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholings or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get ahead.
I don't care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
It's joking when it's said of you that he's a populist.
But you're not showing it with what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, he has only slogans left.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to do them on my side to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character pointing out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take by case the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I claim that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I just started in politics and I try to get the most possible support for my program.
I try to get things through myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, six years from now I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that is why I have visited a series of well-known personalities, in case they were best encouraged to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scales.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for it, to check the blameless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kronor.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against evils and injustices.
Does an Aston Martin drive, your property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get in debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
But I couldn't live on it. For example, I could not afford my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month.
If I wanted to only make money, then I wouldn't run for a candidate.
So you will continue with your business to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in spring.
People would want him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much do you get monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I continue to win.
If I were president, then I'd leave business.

The architecture studio MVRDV demonstrates that the real adventures are not only in the head – in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly finished “montain of books” – 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one comes in for pleasure in those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city located at the gates of Rotterdam that is barely worth a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings while cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called `Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises at the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the 2012 "Dutch National Wood Award".
In this way, the small town lacking in history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can get to visualize the park benches, dogs and children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of mural cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most everyday architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse, told us.
And that’s how one day, in a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of few millimeters thick has been used in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands as a basis for holding crop roots.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This thin fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Even if it is difficult to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is situated under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transverse to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is an automatic blind.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to step foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has also visited the library. She calls Spijkenisse's "Boekenberg" the "late soul."
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; at present it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are packed.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in that discipline that reigns that in specialized slang it is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spikhenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and unfinished it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S. relations Europe, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they are still testing what their role will be, but they have already started the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US. U.S. by refraining from voting in important decisions like in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a tremendous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has managed to earn a certain respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US. The U.S. has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US. US and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities because of American domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation in here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the scope attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must push things out from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of major international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or maybe it’s still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has a harder time playing a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US. The US in European politics is declining more and more, but the EU does not cover that vacuum for the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more protagonist role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular village, c’est la vie!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a denomination officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the real eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be right.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet in which it stores seats in the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch cases are of another nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros a year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that grows at the fastest pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of doubtful legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The processes can be prolonged up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name subject to the lawsuit had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely was initially using a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the 10th consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the Muniquoise.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been right, but the opposite side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files of up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care about," Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if the imitators secure the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial area, however, it managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely cautious about doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights law, but what needs to be done is to "also record in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball slippers, heels and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to slowly rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes almost by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
Over 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school tuition, uniform and guarantee you one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story narrator" or "panegyrist".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir rehearses songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8.733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years old has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without school title, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" that has since been professionally busy with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Carbs and scabies are among parasite-borne STDs.
What are the main groups of those affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years old.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been trending since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise enough money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini herself a confident woman and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that the orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
"Gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof to live and take care that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people of the town to have undergone an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite how evident this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually spoken openly about it.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years in southern Africa by singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to rip a couple of tears from some other rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice sheet is up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet permanently in the shadow a layer of ice has formed.
It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief Messenger probe researcher, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This sunflower image of an extinction star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Propeller Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is still one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two melting galaxies rush toward each other to end up shocking irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Austral Mill.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light-years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a modeling moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continuously emerge; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe you could find mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are increasingly deep.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA. The U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope is lifted.
It allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone who owns a computer can help, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 candidates for planets had been located.
The image shows the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the base that at Mercury’s south pole there is also ice.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is so.
Drinking butter every day and living 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strepy through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people from which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and that are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest celebration and next year we will be celebrating the Most Elderly People Festival in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen local talyshis who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the museum’s undisputed star is sheepherder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we consider that the oldest man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov’s age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Have you then been wrong Şirali Müslümov in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly of this Central Asian.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very elderly people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believe instead that the cause resides in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it tirelessly moves a huge butter tub.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also jump from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with a bulging shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son discovers to us proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, that is why it has never fallen out and has maintained its color.
“I have never used a shampoo either,” says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life I have never gone shopping for a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his course when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes itself to the father figure of the nation, which directs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, at which point he gave the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's graying son is right: "in our culture the elders are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this was not reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as a basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no patho.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular.
All of them, hopelessly plunged into confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a Nile-shore theocracy for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of your power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the “principles of Islamic law.”
What does “principles” mean?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver that it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia law it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islamism.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it aims to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exercise a harsh repression of the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were being held in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, it is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it is to be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits the "offense of people"
Is a president cartoon or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in the Cario and swore to defeat the Act before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election charts.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the garbage can of history."
Through Twitter he accused Morsi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
"When you convene the referendum, we will go to your palace and overthrow you," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for counter-protesting; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi "cleanse the country", while proclaiming: "the Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk something like that happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and supporters of the constitution would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists’ draft is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were being held in prison or had to face trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three branches of government caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda is also abandoned by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The World's Most Fluffy Fish?
Norway’s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country is related to its greed for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on how smelly you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets dark and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most-of-the-say, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also what is known as the “General of the Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, if quite smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be purchased.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or sandwich costs you a whopping €10 ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway’s current wealth, there has been the growth, since the early 70’s, of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we do so well," says Anna, our waitress, while passing rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde hair and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that they didn’t have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a wrench.
I'm in the snow queuing to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moroon burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that smelly fish is back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nostrils.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears a bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation’s management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been obtaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," he said. Peña Nieto earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulder over with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña was governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism on the spot and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr.'s new roads. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with its name on the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he will make real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy of Mr. Olvera Hernández’s party. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, when it comes to security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic stateman and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called for intervention to help fight drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
On a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr.'s critics. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while he was in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got home, it seemed like he had had his body cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross on which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a rioter, a whim.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning’s allegations of abuse during his prison stay
The trial focuses on Manning's term at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution carried out to Manning in a preview of the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits by officers from the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which was carried out during a hearing following the defence's request to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned on a maximum detention basis from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had called the treatment given to him by the guards as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms show no report of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had discussed these problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
Army Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regimen under which he was.
The military said it had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from the outside pointing into his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 on the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an argument she had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in her Quantico cell, she was forced during a morning recount to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the guard who was to drop the blanket he could have covered with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip-flops to self-harm but that he hadn’t.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
Her lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she went through during her prison stay and dramatically reduce her sentence should she be convicted on the court-martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with enforcement rules to any detainees in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally prompting the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and arrived in the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, I have been called "Mexican" throughout my life.
It’s about ethnic shorthand, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends call themselves “Italians.”
Later I decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary level and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that time this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading block in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that entails the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is what they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about spite?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are your descendants and we are loyal to you.
Not to Mexico.
And, although perhaps we are living now the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over our shoulders as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either of them.
We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate matters even more, so I’ve heard during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much spite.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, folks.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles coming from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though the Israelis and Palestinians appear to be anchored in their old conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make your fight even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to think that his lethal impasse could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten well.
And despite killing some of its leaders and put pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has been unable to wipe out Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have gained influence all over the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurring regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia-party dominates, passing through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’ brother cousins and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist who cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for having initiated the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on Jan. 22, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their countrymen have done in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their head.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Sr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire bodes well and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that proclaimed by sensible people from both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel’s cession of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put the brakes on the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, are in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic tobacco packaging law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts look on packs of a green off, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian tobacco law and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of a muted olive green, a gruesome image of body parts with diseases and representations of sick children and babies because they are children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of font.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
Trust studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance that he will never.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited after the law passed.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for skinneckers and silicone covers to cover up the unpleasant images of the packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a recusal of the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Mrs. He claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was expecting more stock.
"For us it's a good deal."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone on to be done online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and you just have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw a rise in reviews of brands from “foot citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It may be asked if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry is focusing more on what new regulations involve than marketing.
Industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to recuse the new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek claimed that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
“You take the cigarette and save the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in central Sydney, says the uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unfavele a delivery; now it took me four," Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that’s it, it’s okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving holiday, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not forgetting about duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since, currently, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good spirit?
Yes.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating from the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a very different way," John D said. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology, University of York in Ontario, Canada
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group made up of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He says the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be the problem to be.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants heard a tape from a person reading the journal article.
Some groups listened in the next room to a full-fledged television show that was unrelated, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the show with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom," Mark J said. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like spotting faulty parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
“In fact, we currently know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "boredowth-tend scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do it all."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teens are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you’re bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer get bored, but he won’t have learned to entertain himself or dose,” said Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in Southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution over something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes each carrying a fine of 100 U.S. dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession causes depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was approved.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has taken effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from suburban Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," Daniel J said. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in Washington state are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all this before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” Brian E says. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that will serve as a model," he says.
Washington’s law, dubbed I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which two waters will swim, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer an “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition to conduct cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s police chief, emailed his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop bringing legal action for minor misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that police would stop pressing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing city regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal proceedings against those faults that at the time they occurred were a crime," he said. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like Mesa’s rural county, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana use for recreational use into the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've spent so much time taking people in court that, in reality, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become nationally tested for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to knock downdoors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to run for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed in the new law,” Kevin A said. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted for in favor of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any time in my life when I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed it was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 80’s to pursue the history career, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and burst into tears.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had left because I was forced to drink in squarred cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You might wonder what that's coming from now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of the students of the Conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights that homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of the JCR (undergraduate group) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are “often seriously removed, personally attacked and treated as unpleasant people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s equal opportunity committee to ensure they can freely express their opinions.
Their situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which featured the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and a cane with the silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery that was made of conservative university students, but they participated in it willingly.
The policy of the miners strike, the privatization and the government’s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first one I attended, French texts from the 18th century were to be translated into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like a cake dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
“Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just fools?” he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to hold.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on my back.
He was a sophomore English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything that Mrs. said. Thatcher.
That trick turned out useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60’s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who thought like me only after dusk?
Should I become a Labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were waiting for me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
He was hated for being not only from the Conservative party, but also thatcher’s adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
I was barely over there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, finding refuge in my most open metropolitan-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40’s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His sore eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and resigned his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed me" and I called them "old fools."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was in scavenged with fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak weeping.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by her "maison" for the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signorere" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble dressmaker in the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty is nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off their skinny butts on your gorgeous rug like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60’s and 70’s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt its spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model,” which began working with him during Paris Costure Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of style because their designs are works of art," he concludes.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-required loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dream "audience" that sports masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti used in "theDiba.
In that public of mannequins light names such as the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Dressmaker, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fair.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtano can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of being old and the opportunity to wear one of their evening costumes...
The time finally came in the late 90’s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a skirt of blown-outs, "corsage" draped and cleavage word of honor.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless thing," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses from the dressmaker with "the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it entails."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of high society".
Obnubled for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was flawless, time is not passing for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After starting large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that loads on their shoulders through rugged stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at the passage of a turtle, keeping the balance and sluggishly measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall by the cliff.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell for years ago for the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatigoously carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, to its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three sizes a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhumane effort, it is three times what it would gain on the field.
"The day of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)", clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the pit was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing his skin for three in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to take his toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano fires.
It is the price you must pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wooden cabin with other porters, he rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defiing the shadows, Anto descends into the crater lighting with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and to the extent of the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge per camera that, together with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavy bearer who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says that he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of serious illness ... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions rip 15 tons of sulfur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a goat road between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works by loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The Singaporean population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let us fulfill our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the announcement they will get attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to enforce people with “their national duty.”
This is purely internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make as creative as possible to fix this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spend US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population divide, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as a replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy for the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that has a hard end in dramatically increasing immigration to address population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, abounds who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s governing party experienced its worst election outcome since independence.
Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as a "shoebox", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there are concerns that they can promote a single-life lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who used to be hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city in the state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district seems not to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the motives that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the final say.
The private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the field of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing on the Internet situations that you surely would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name", when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t be uploaded to a post,” says Jorge, ten, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who’s making a fool of myself,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been hinted at or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressed me or demanded it simply from my account," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of my friend was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"He just gave him privacy."
It then explains a number of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I like it or I want it.
"Even though I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion about what is convenient or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Below, Porras lists a few options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like you posted about a friend?
Do you know what the others post about you?
When you tag holiday photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you’re doing each moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must still be on social networks," he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read social media policies conscientiously.
By understanding each of the subsections they have solid foundations for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guard, it is key to remind the children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially pointed out that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later claimed that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government website.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists' access to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents attending, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for greater data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were transmission systems secured for all journalists but limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that would lead a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are leading to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful resolution of disputes, of international treaties and tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenry for which we are expanding the agreements on residence."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the Internet at a low price in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give greater details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional event that he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute in a respectful way after a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Today (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
In that regard, he advocated the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum.
Correa said he was not sorry for that decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish court for requiring him to submit to the interrogation in his territory for an alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that I had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe-conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the lockdown of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of proceedings in different European bodies," he said.
And he said that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe passage this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate for freedom of the press and qualified that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, it was congratulated that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup lined with legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That failure is not being complied with at the moment.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion of the maritime boundaries litigation that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is correct for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries commit to accept failure however hard it may be."
Referring to the eventuality that is presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador’s that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse into President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNAUR) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid him from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to learn about it; with such a commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut".
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that patients present when initiating diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "while staying in control, can live without problems until the age of 75," explained the interviewee.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
I visualize it, so it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to have the test of a private laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better burst three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they had a risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle slogan for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
The biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "indeed has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that is very well but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you love them?" is a common question, with snore and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, who are not wanted to expose the adolescents, said the communicator.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred are in public toilet dispatchers of the places that the young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13° of HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood stream and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a court of appeals of the United States a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario places a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in the guarantee of survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, against the hair of international conventions.
In the practical field, the endorsement of the sentence issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties in the beyond el Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s top glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main proceeding is the commercial tender filed in Mexico.
The first point would imply not knowing the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profile.
In fact, towards that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompanies vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts that had with its parent company the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts endorsed the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the straws of the country.
For the moment, the signing of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the latter, that is, the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not prosper, Cerciorare’s appeal will be demanded, which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious thing about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law of Commercial Contests, stating that it was vented with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they beat Vitro and hit the country.
Balance General
Asleep for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviation Pilots already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to Dragon Mart
Meeting the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society generally approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a quiet housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that swept part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the friends against the industry.
ACTA died
Heared by the government, a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action came despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting those of short, the housing developer Homex is placing in the market Certificates Stock Market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identicals to offer to pay interest every 28 days.

Composed of the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, has just been born a consortium with corporate name Competival, whose objective will be the service market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the field exceed 1.5 trillion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Troutworlds of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, the whole world traveled.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, player of the National Upper Basketball, agent and leader in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put a lot of hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate to make that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote his extensive trajectory, thus attest.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those who recall his passage through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 serving as a co-apower or proxy for the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-apower or manager.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a strong, 6"7" tall player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because for 1988 it was already figured of mandamás federativo.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth place and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world championship.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90's due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan American de Mar del Plata mess, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that without counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the Ponce guys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman Dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980's, he has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved Dallas hometown, again playing the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she encounters an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two comedies that were on the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received critical roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and risky millions of dollars in bookmakers.
He also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it in and turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.’s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to cross her out of a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to be interned.
"I know what I want on the J.R. tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, on Friday recalled Hagman as someone "huge, on and off screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no warning from Warner or TNT about how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I believed would hurt someone or affect them in some way," she told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise you, I give you courage, I meet with them when they come for your surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they're going to be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They begin course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deudarmageddon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the end-of-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there ever was," Charmé told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If you look at what’s been going on in the world today like we’re 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said he believed in the Dec. 21 expiration date.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we somewhat discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a senior in Temple, 21, and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"Elsewhere people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a La Salle University religion professor who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "the end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
