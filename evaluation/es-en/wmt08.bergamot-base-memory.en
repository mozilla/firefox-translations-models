European inflation slipped into food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is first due to the rapid growth in the price of food products.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistics Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the North American, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "you have to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene in this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
The completion prices of wheat increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold almost 100 dollars a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, by contrast to 2009 it will decline to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double the interest rates by the ECB during 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) compared to the support of a fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scale: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - the proportion of those who judged the economic situation in the country has never been so high, 41 percent, while another 46 percent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the hopeless expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deteriorating situation and only one tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of Government rather detracts badly than his functions.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population do not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots of last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the stake question responded that they would participate surely and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would participate safely only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the service of medical consultations and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would refuse the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and that of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price level rise of 16 percent maintained the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that this year has not increased VAT.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the HUF thousand.
As in December of last year, prices had already "skyrocketed" in food supermarkets, so a drastic percentage increase was not experienced compared to the high starting point.
However, it is evidently terrifying for consumers that what the past year could buy at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest-value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of the past year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of the past year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
The average price growth last year was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
This process was precisely the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader poorly plans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF at the value registered in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only an 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than the past year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets grew more than 30 percent the price of basic consumer items.
(However this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foods, registered in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case just a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking preserved food by pallets.
In Wednesday’s morning, large queues were formed in the three stores ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals in the first place due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then a significant surgical intervention has not been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, medical-head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals surely this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents has been recorded, the rest of them have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to the MRSA, i.e. the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
SA infections (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is exaggerated or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or sepsis first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened organism, elderly or low-weighted people.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Hospital János there is nothing special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nurses care for them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-screened to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even so infection can be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of the MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients who carry the MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when visible MRSA infections already occur in the patient - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict entrustments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
It must be emphanized that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological examinations should be done to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent for traveling patients or basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, a very important role plays a lot of hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, however also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of contagion with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data supplied, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including the MRSA) and that of hospital infections that are due to these pathogens.
Negative the alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident by the district police commander XXII has been made.
It can be excluded the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state the since then resigned commander of the police of the district XXII, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passerby - reported on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverage before getting behind the wheel.
The then-district police chief XXII police officer, on Tuesday with his private vehicle, turning to Kossuth Lajos Street in District XXII, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian-designated area.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always give way when folding.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
For what happened the police leader of the district resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation into the case is handled by the Budapest Investigative Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian finance minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euro to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out of the subsidy of the cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit agreement of 150 million euros is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be made later, when extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will employ mainly for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
Agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalized the details of the Metro financing with the EU, they will return to the issue that whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this can take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth 8.4 billion euros.
The interest on the claims is in accordance with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging commission for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and those who buy in the even cheaper market in the EU, that will be quickly expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slope apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts at Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and can thus be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital properties is constantly growing, since demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six for hundreds Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the level of experts will be completed on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations will continue at the level of ministers on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map available on post-emissions reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, up to 2012.
There are currently lively discussions about the particular between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach the agreement that compared to the situation of 1990, until 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect decreases by 25 to 40 percent.
Another big theme of the conference is that whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on aid to provide developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 20 percent, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the world’s other large developed regions and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, among this the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with – the press release of the Ministry of the Environment is scheduled.
Much is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association that deals with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of more than 2o C of the average temperature of the Earth, a fact that according to the scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - declared to the BBC the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the highly edited and censored recordings, the distributor also includes amateur videos, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have already uploaded to the Internet numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way for recruitment with the free downloadable shooter video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put themselves directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salted cupcake at the Christmas party of the ministries
The working minister Monika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the 2007 year with salted cake and coffee.
There is ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power is amused.
Also the state offices are preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
On the Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad are invited. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and the six hundred workers of the ministry, the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
At the party of the wallet will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for the Economic Development of Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we fail to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origo] reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will have only coffee and savoury cupcake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own auditorium with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of HUF 2500 per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF all the years celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a reception of Ano Nuevo on January 20, Christmas will not be held in the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing up, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions that are celebrated every year, begin with a brief speech of the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas holidays - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they could not report on the budget of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The Liga Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will constitute on Friday a strike commission to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will surely cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will completely stop and until 13 hours will also be on strike the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
Likewise, the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Drivers will be constituted that will coordinate the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will pronounce themselves on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, significant difficulties in transport will have to be had: in the railways you will stop working indefinitely, by the morning you may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity transport of buses of the Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others in definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received until now, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours will be striked the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, those of Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Unions of the Electricity Industry and Thermal Energy, the Unions of the Educators called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will speak on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is for them to gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into effect next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for the case of advance pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital: The country increases the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region has increased.
In the "risk warning" of the company it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy people of Hungary, even in the short term there may be violent ethnic confrontations."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this nature – added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006 it received increasing publicity and momentum the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been constituted in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the State" - they add.
They affirmed: all this occurs in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
To highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, in numerous neighboring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way than for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungary’s Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense – can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The director of research of Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the question of the news agency, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year publishes their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by issuing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the coming year will be less - the working hours are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America are the holidays unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and festive days.
The holidays are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical events.
We celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st the party of work, on November 1 and 2 we remember our family and deceased friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is a single workday.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of work who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory instead for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically the life in the country stops, since according to the experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 is a holiday.
The other change is related to the feast of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes during the end of year party can rest, since from December 24 will not be worked on almost anywhere, or even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small deterrents to bitter the lives of your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: they are all part of our daily Folklore" at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to the small discomfort or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
$iscule, I forgot to let you know you've been wanted from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to repair the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
In most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it’s worthwhile to meditate on the things with which you can bitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to take a document, an office tool or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you placed the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Can you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for subtracting their things.
Don’t take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass everyone on the information (conjecture) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Do not abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares with you his innermost secrets!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you phone the office and say that you are sick and your head pains unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your undelayed tasks, your work on term.
Don't bother your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Humming, gues, phone calls
Are you in your work, but they abruptly take the latters out of it from your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your humming, singing, conversations out loud (except when you do them over your head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message!
You don’t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be unready, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is slowly advancing in the usual jam of the morning.
It sounds an extra compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National musical life didn’t spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this jam when you are listening to the new album of Zagar.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the national digital underground are gradually changing the image and although again it is fashionable the garage style rock, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi team until he began his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of selling also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and its ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they are pleasantly wearing this label.
The team reacted as they should react: they prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Záger.
It is fine the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that lately broadcasts from the morning to the night popular music. This station carried to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivas Underground").
Well, everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balazs Záger.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How much do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, we trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in their group and from there we undertook another path.
hvg.hu: On the hit list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar’s name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the good voice soloists of our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you exactly write the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something is still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice I wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead we did not consciously want to distribute solo papers.
The song also talks about it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, the one who from where he came from and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work for?
Zs.B.: In musical composition actually none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little everything got to its place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I have already "let go" of the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
An embezzlement disloyal.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good capabilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" he let himself be heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he said in his replies.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1,600 million euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that it was not disclosed.
He even deceived the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in their businesses.
The risk became a benefit
Did he fear that he would discover?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position, we had to work gradually.
He went to work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing school in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled among the 51,000 dollars.
Two years later he was already assistant brokerage and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they looked at me cautiously.
Due to my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a 500 million euro title.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball," police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or that they rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
Only, later, the coup came earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all footprints.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of it.
And how did they get him to locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no vacation is a runner who does not want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
It is practically half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kroner will emerge from seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should be funded for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them least.
Twenty-year-old sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court ruled
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua on Thursday decreed the 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropili.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP that, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison agents if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán was constantly transferring government money to a company’s account in Pánama.
This society was fictional and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supportersT.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how they approved the budget
That's it.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional sight although the most influential, quietly approved the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public financing deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to obtain other sources of investment, other than tax money, fees and bank credits, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks that received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which boasts ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to bring order to the state’s finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, except for some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why the massive social programs that, unfortunately, in recent years inutilly swelled with gigantic measures, are not necessary.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform soon will be the end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical deliveryrs of most of the money from retirement taxes and social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending by the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for preparing other law reforms.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the finance market crisis.
In the Monetary Marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to tender forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and diminish the consequences of the finance crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," Bernard Bamohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to customers.
"This coordinated action by central banks likely decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what’s still ahead when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more dear to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR fee, a London interbank fee used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of lending themselves money even as the U.S., Canada and Britain’s central banks cut their interest rates several times over the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself regarding the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Azul, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are word fireworks, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy in discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only find myself with the caricature of my ideas".
Now those interested can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the capacity to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on the global warming between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about it in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people did not change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers had the date and therefore did not change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year’s hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of licenses, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and the interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues a half hour is expected.
In Prague, the new card has not yet been removed around 140,000 drivers.
The broadcast of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to ask for the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred kroner.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The policeman can fix the violation with a warning.
If an administrative violation is, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, a fine could be received by a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of a thousand kroner, at most.
According to the member of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand kronors do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand over the driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will gradually need to change the other types of driving license.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with offender David Berdych will spend thirteen to ten years in prison.
The High Court in Prague decided as a final maturity to reduce the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the Prague department against organized crime were originally going to fall between 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case charged but he is first awaited by the court of first instance verdict.
Despite this, in other proceedings he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the heist of 19 people and the higher court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation for being fabricated cases.
According to the central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment concerns criminal acts performed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Regarding theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permit.
In the home search, police found pistols, steel-cored ammunition, a laser handler and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of kroner.
Except for nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already convicted Berdych and others accused.
Other men related to Berdych’s case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change children: 12 million
For changing children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million kroner of compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers at most 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescistory value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň’s family wanted, for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared in the hospital of the Faculty of Motol in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men although they fought with recriminations over the change of the girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently living and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 kroners to each family at the end of October as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask the administrator for help.
The court until today recognized them with proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and especially of a million kroner.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not show up today for oral sight.
According to your attorney the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polivka's lawyer said after the process.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for that reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Wallachia brand was first used by Polívka on his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about orienting him towards the creation of a fictional realm.
Some years later, Harabiš came to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comedy origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to his farm speakers and attended to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team which were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, among the now broken downs, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Poland the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the one chosen forever".
The lead role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, resulted in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society that until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clearly could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal even more data or dates.
"We have no rush.
It would have to be something like the king's path to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka may come forward," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Prejudices overcome
To tell the truth I have never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I have only to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the header space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I step inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the headwaters disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
I should rate it as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic terms it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same-selless vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child’s stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that is quite flat after knocking down the backrests of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection inlet over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that despised the relative five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the škoda era of then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 by 329,900 kroner, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only that we would still have airbag in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kronor.
It is a lot, but it has the complements of the team in the Fabia and will reach a very similar number.
Now it remains only to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools children from countries of eastern Europe attend and therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between migrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, storry and anger between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her son with racist slurs.
Police also had to act after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls entertained him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy walked up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him he made us in addition to throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt," described another nasty incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the migrants of eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it really is the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy, golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
palm trees and the all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 20’s.
He was ordered to be built by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba such as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50’s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Havana Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 50's, until today they are still operating in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived have long since rusted between these humid and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels grew not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by rail lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from immense plantations to sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most speakers does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Lush vegetation growing on limestone earths.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and rocks of steep highs in the falls of the valley, and in its caves are acclimatized fertile lands thanks to which rocks that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the cigar factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone finds it interesting that there the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot.
Trinidad
Old abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so secluded that even in the 50’s of the last century there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
That opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that came 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, from all this many pages could be filled.
However, as they say, better to see it once.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say the Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission’s march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mison in Afghanistan is not turning out as it was thought, the representatives of the countries who have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time that the conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert gates, encouraged NATO forces to increased activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development," Defense Minister Des Browne told BBC broadcaster.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to U.S. military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent stocks grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organizing and equipping the units.
Exactly they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We'll have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and the way we'll achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, the controversy prevails of whether all allies make the most in Afghanistan.
For liability, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands for struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The Sun, this week, called German soldiers vague.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troop was playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will reach a trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion kroner.
This year the government planned to lend itself 159.2 billion V-kroner.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to improved evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic’s state debt grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June, it has declined 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state in early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
For all last year the state borrowed more than 111 million kroner.
"For now it seems that thanks to next year's low deficit we could pass the trillion-crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroners," said iHNed.cz, the economist at Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance economist Vladimir Pikora also sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to be seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state’s debt is paid through treasury bonds, state obligations, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment bank.
The state’s indoor debt this year grew from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kornae and since June it was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt of the first to third quarter grew by 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform, "said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and management of the state’s debt for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
In early December, the ministry declined the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to improved evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million kroner in vey of the expected 91.3 billion kroner.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner to finance the state’s obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments on the loans of the European investment bank.
He compared Khartoum in front of a court today to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam has been convicted Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having left 6 to 7 years old students to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was a matter of a whiplash.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, serving at the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, resulting from several complaints from parents of pupils before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear he - himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry just that she asked the children to vote for a name,” it’s just a “nothen-and-key mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " who never speak of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the most given middle name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name I often choose by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their divergences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called for Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated to 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council, by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned by the UN, last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the concession of independence in Kosovo in the security council, insist on a persecution of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and is compromised in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the UN of Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade says it is particularly afraid of a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990's.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the final word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush opens agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference gathered by himself on Tuesday to Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately strike up negotiations in view of finding a final regulation of the 60-year-old litigation point between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides to their obligations to the path to peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This denomination covers the three main conflicting problems of the Israeli-Palestinian litigation: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the coming negotiations be “global and deepened” and referred in all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jeruslaus, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Once up his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged what the upcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush fixed the end of the implementation of his " vision of two States " of Palestinians and Israelis coexisting in late 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had won an effort in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose involvement in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a blueprint, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud estimates in his periodic Arabic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, last Sunday?
Just as each time in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " at all gas ".
"He hampered the police car on the left side, after a breach of the yield the step to the right," the police say.
The alcohol control practiced on the vehicle occupants was revealed negative.
The condition of the car (the defunded front, cracked windshield, bumpers started) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " facts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of help " to the IGPN, co-co-co-collected with the departmental leadership of the public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specifies that the investigation of the IGPN, to this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-cyclet arrived relatively quickly to his left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the footweights on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been put in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been shrudded and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been autopied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing relief to both young men.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious misconduct " concerning this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, about which you have to be very cautious," said one police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these some moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely hits the scene.
" We came down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw " a completely frightened policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone."
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had leggan on the site.
Always according to this witness, the reliefs arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march."
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them, "said the prosecutor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the framework of the state of emergency have been injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone gunfire, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
To Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court required a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of some 500 arrests over the course of the weekend of opponents, male rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement picked up the support of the regrouped religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “exhorted the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste they took the oath to in front of Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's promise does not fulfill any more "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referred to the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak out in the coming days about the legality of re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect vote, of President Musharraf.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry has been eliminated and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president " does not value any more " after the establishment of a state of emergency, he told Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into consideration unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly overcome births.
Still today, more than one pregnancy out of every three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth vote that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into consideration unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly overcome births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "domain of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of pill utilization among women aged 20 to 44 is past 5 % in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated just about a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of their duration, their departure from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "slopped" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday at the time that the astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece tasked with soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing platform for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was thus to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having displaced it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfolds as accordions, has been damaged in little more or less than a meter by a cable that was bowed.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who were initially having a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go repairing another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to engage in the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters in length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space giver) of NASA.
High, resistant, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been in charge of "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having inspected precisely the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "slats" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" that had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-handed horseback riding with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "sloppy" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a mid-off before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS share is currently on a sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays in the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational outcome of EADS failed at 86 % in 2006, essentially due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group expected a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Poutine, Russia united.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs voters a televised message about public broadcasters, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his issue of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Denounces a campaign stained by pressures.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is "never had such dirty elections, until Eltsin's time."
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former checker champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are banned according to his lawyer.
" The Russians guarded the homo sovieticus mentality "
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that elected the government and the president?
Whatever it is, legislative elections like the presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the state university of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society fell behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90's, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief," estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " will of their own free will renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches on all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plan to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, like in the 90’s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Aren’t those in power too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential nature, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerite regime, are in free access.
The 47 million documents of archives, stored on 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only in a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow search "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of the forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war in a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent wage earners deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Search for Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
European Union foreign ministers had given their approval to the European Commission last April to begin negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will very much dope both economies " and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". L'European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a ten billion-pound offer to the 5.75 percent base index in five weeks, an unusual offer.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tightened by the end of the year, and to give banks a greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the Bank said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12h GMT, the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the English bank BoE puts liquidities on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "prepared to take other steps to keep interbank loan indexes " up to date in line with its base index.
The interbank rate per day was on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty index that had discouraged banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European central bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist proposal for a law on purchasing power, which amounts to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (inland rate for oil products), a cheque-transport or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition some hours after the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amendment finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current movement of festivals in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 confided to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known under the name of Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the UK, which annually attracts about 80 000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn also took care of the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as a " most inspiring event " he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and were working with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional site that will ultimately take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, having unmarked in the landscape of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and 11.3M$ in 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban atmosphere.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are held rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states " that they are quite interesting to allow investing in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very big", in the example of the 80 000 people of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been thrown at the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate’s duties.
A mandate — “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governator"?
"You have to be cautious, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that are going to judge the best,” he says.
The race to festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of the cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec movies, give them value, and make sure filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30° Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the bill for Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks to lay off the close of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will occur.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favor of the stock market taking rail in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values in both long and short sections."
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially since the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs scored on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert says that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news that comes from the United States in terms of the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if given.
“ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we expect other construction companies like Ferrovial and FCC to go their same way,” the expert explains.
Cycical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, only two times December has been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally was experienced in 2003, a year in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to have its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to make the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to point or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not represent a great investment, although if a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, explains Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that rightly, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very large schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to do the competition to our customers,” Rivero said.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of rival Antena 3
We have achieved it.'
With that phrase, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the market, when he found that the chain that he directs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect marked his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we have fallen less.’
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain places its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five-Day publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison to Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed one billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this data was made real, the television network would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution on the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol.'
According to analysts, the market shows at this time a certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to which it has cut expected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend profitability and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of getting both into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and internalization of orders systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose in the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep track of all operations they perform, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it emphasizes that the securtized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of subprime mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was taken advantage of to legally delimit the functions that can be carried out by diplomas in Economics and Businesses 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require authorization the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing of products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, has said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42,000 million euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time he amassed record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the one hundred percent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and that will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the bank with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the target of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve his purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, such as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats of the council and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and who according to sources of the investigation consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'ringleader' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the Ministry of Urbanism and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As yesterday reported by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore aforado, was arrested leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions of Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE’s candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
The former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the Government and general secretary of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to top the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This has been announced at a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that has held this noon in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fight against climate change in the university environment.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political forefront since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and to make him "more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can not speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall in what, he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "arrogance".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change undermines both skeptics of their predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government’s action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain’s heading forward by the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what are the measures you will take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there hasn't been or will be those explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Detained the mayor and the head of the local police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, have reported today sources of the investigation.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose premises he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urban Planning and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the No. 1 Court in Totana.
The first six detainees have taken to justice today.
According to the sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today regional parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Sole de Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It advocates, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the sign of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction of Internet Downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal in the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than that imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be under six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films by the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's going out of his hand, a very long hand.

My GP I'm missing one of his articles on rare research titled, 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic MRIs at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were successful they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don't know if I required this conclusion so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main responsible for the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary of the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, 'The list of Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
What sure suits me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver before possible accidents, is a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of this, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment materializes in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of this, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the share to be paid.
That’s why both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of accident rate due to their caution.
Also, using the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it on the probability of having some type of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 find themselves with various inconvenience when it comes to contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a full-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a full risk with franchise, so that they get the coverage of a full-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the accident that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage to third parties, although not in the face of those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses, "clarifies Noguera.
After the 25-year-old range, drivers have it easier to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire a full risk with franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to being used in an accident, and even at the time of driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, to which he adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at full risk with franchise (can be this of 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third party extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is recommended a full insurance with franchise (this being 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the 'Champions' league, since the Italians are used to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified in the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives Benfica, who has four, does not advance him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would come first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's side could even serve a loss to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but can not be trusted because at nine points equal the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct match.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who hope to get into eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar that only is worth the victory, in the event that he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighth and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and with no options to follow in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they broke out in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out to witness the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that made furor at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls took the stage wearing bracelets that had been given by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that crowded the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria’s nerves had been banned days before.
In the lead-up to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our costumes, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"She was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought not, so I'm happy to have made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of affecting Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about transit rate levels [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The latest major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
NHS "will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records for employees outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scotland health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor-general’s report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign personnel.”
The President of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he said.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence authorizations.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely followed.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guidance of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was of great interest to be done to this work in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biopic about Joy Division’s late vocalist Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture award.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film, in black and white, featuring soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced with only 3 thousand pounds.
But also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the Joshua Tree album of U2, awarded with two awards - for best director and best debuting director, was also winner.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony – like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss from London, in David Cronenberg's film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently film the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard HArris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders who must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda militants in fighting allied forces and backing the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered a heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants – recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-West government – targeted residences of foreign nationals associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing financial support and support to the militants.
Climate of Venus may give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offers an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two such similar planets.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police confiscation "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon Nov. 28 were more ridiculous than the snow monkey that asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to climb the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The harshest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leader in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word of being nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and broadly speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of China’s toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
To Mr. Guilini was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr. Giuliani to stumble towards the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of the Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all expectations, first in Iowa’s most recent poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is ramping up in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, nor are they horbitant hotel accounts in Paris, or sucked from extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour ruling party, of more than 650,000 pounds sterling (1.3 million dollars), for about four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative slop.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s David Abrahams’ multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that it does not take him long, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is defensive and does not focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Even if I wanted to deny Tony Blair, it was his senior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock problems and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as the Treasury chancellor.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or ‘partner cash’, political party funding research — voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown is not as bad as it seems.
Gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown has always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political taxpayers are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those with power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr.'s agreement. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to convict his party for violating the law, but he is diluted in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a police matter.
Besides, there are other things than Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent boss for the Public Life Standards Commission, because he has not had one for six months, and must also push for genuine party financing reform.
This will require a hard work of Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that dorsal fins are swimming excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach 99 million dollars if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in office in its American consumer financing business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the 3.89% crime rate was nearly one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in American people’s bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a major loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payout rates, showing how much of their debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct crisis infection channels between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to burden credit card debt now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the emitters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt goes up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates, or altering credit balances.
That should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid asset retassion.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction push America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
We must keep watch for those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for the frauds with Enron's former head of the financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was sentenced as guilty of fraud collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became a celebrated cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the Enron collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron society, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped its spiral of falling in bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a 3-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
“It has up to 18 passengers,” says Gulfstream representative Dan Firer.
"But none ask for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract wealthy new Russians to all sorts of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Provisioned fuel from the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in a heyday.
“We lived the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies.
“Like the Saudis of the 70’s and the Japanese in the 90’s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of the wealthiest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealthy include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the brand’s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costumes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turvotsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pens, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy 30 euro tickets ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," Mr. said. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand in Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the vendors said the rich Russians with the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the eye-catching logos to the limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of the King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for custom, said it had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Non-millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) stuffed with billion-dollar fake bill stacks.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake up piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
"Slops" surgery could cause a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance go up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," Mr. said. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the Newark Police Department director.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but works at the 212 de la Av home. West Scott.
Authorities still do not determine what caused the death of the ms. Stream, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has a sorrow to the upper ranks of the Newark policeman.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police officer, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” says Mr. McCarthy on Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow said detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived near 3 P.m.
On November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead at the scene.
It’s been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not tell if Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rose bush is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - was located on the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in learning about the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, "you have to keep an eye on this one or that one," he said.
"She was always here when I was, and so was she was.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which rose with calming comments from the U.S. central bank vice president.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business would increase, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to close to 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the reappearance of credit tension in markets after strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001, was highlighted.
Pressure on the Bank of England to track the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London strained credit and three-month “Libor” loan rates among British banks, marked the high rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England take the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team who is on loan – with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to fill himself with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
The one who doesn’t get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and the sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it just enough time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, they would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless given the chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain’s eye at the same time taking a wicket and a hitter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium may be only a matter of opinion.
The option may break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In Shah’s favor is his brilliant and valuable proof of the early 88th debut in Mumbai, 32 hundred first-class versus just 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two turns in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next encounter, he seemed to have taken from his batting some of him than in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joie de vivere in swords.
He catches on for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for England’s car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked in the distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, driving out the exiles who were left without cash, without extensions of the visa and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he declares, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that a U.S.-allied force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of his stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops entrenched groups of armed “citizens,” who work in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian gangs of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring up sectarian tensions again and the fighting begins.
Little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlinders lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sardian who is not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle about itself from the smallest federal state for its centuentennaire.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system that in a study of the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their college career here with two or three dipolms.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saar is above average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a baccalaureate.
"In Saarland, the system of vocational education is used," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their high school in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saar is 7 points percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Saarland forced higher schools to do more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first study of PISA, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this one has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
The comparison with upcoming studies will show whether the students’ performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backlog students in school development declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlanders, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandis are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets change the schedule in the South American country, delaying the clock half an hour.
Chavez is currently coming as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass at minus four GMT hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in its day impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do it,” says Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where citizens of the country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, it could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said he criticized Uribe’s decision to offend Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk in Spain about Chavez.
A new ringtone causes sensation in the country: "Why not shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who felt upset about the continuous interruptions by the populists of the left at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to Hans Böckler Foundation calculations, German employees should have a lower real wage-account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in the value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of economic cycles told the newspaper "Bild".
Also the new burdens of unemployment insurance may correspond to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% when it goes from one year to another, is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the work office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German social-democratic party.
On Tuesday, it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices to last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere it is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that until now had not been considered. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that lightning might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays fall from a height of 54 kilometers of one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, told the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller’s life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it is not like this: if there was life there one day, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that sub-zero temperatures can be reached.
"Possibly Venus is a "diabolical" twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there have been no special missions, just for research on this planet, the launch of Venus-Express in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest research results to be presented in many Nature articles, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the well-known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the fastest spinning clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric terrestrial layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the almost equal mass to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called the alba star or evening star orbits the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not closely resemble Earth, scientists start from the base that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there was water that on Earth stayed in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated itself in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties over the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Foreign Ministry.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany’s reputation and that is why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as A Divided Nation," Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the field of foreign policy, emphasizes the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional One China policy course.
China also knows that," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of Dalai Lama and was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative policy on the outside world.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery provoked great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", it froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese chief government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception from Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those in France.
Battles with police in the streets, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They became barricades, the Vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We also have to look at the fact that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal state and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young men staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the performances are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
More vocational training positions must be ensured.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
Young people must be "given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday night around 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not because of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that you do not have to expect anything more from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
Regarding the reproach he was made for having repeatedly dedicated himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and so showed he made it clear that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was very clearly stated to everyone that this reproach was adequate.
You could feel no minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country’s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented himself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
An example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself greatly for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that a boost will come to people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without leaving by the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing he does is talk about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong to talk when it comes to supplementing children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, staged a showdown in a heated debate of Republican YouTube presidential candidates and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the beginning, tensions between the candidates are noticeable.
Mitt Romney blamed his adversary Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has not yet had a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small videos of 30 seconds, shot by internet users that were sent to Youtube, also do not have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding" as torture, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” Romney said, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf rules without uniform.
A day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took swearing in for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his term as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he seized power with a bloodless military coup, the former general first rules the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the position of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the Musharraf sworm will soon annul the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawyers in favor of Musharraf. Last week, the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the government’s controversial new elections on Oct. 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the Northern Wathiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70's continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written in the best time of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of them its box, its cables and above all its buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia made music again.
What needs to be revealed here is this: the questions accurately have shown that the band’s name rumbled in people’s minds, but it wasn’t something so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially since the equivocation Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their work of life, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in awe.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist life full of surprises.
They say that one day a Harmonia de Ottenstein singing association pennant appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band struggled financially.
Life as an artist was not just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and occasionally do rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has had more success than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was also discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Dr. is also present there. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock’s influences to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, she is left with the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
Deep down there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to be able to produce extraordinary shades with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently, electronic music is how it had to be.
Three people who delve into technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it is coughed, whispered and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in the schools of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage he reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does music start and where does the music end?
That can break your nerves or give away a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere is only missing more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again engaged in war in the Balkans.
But the two didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts look a lot at actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" also can't help in this case.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere was again discovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today do movie titles have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for sight: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, which as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm era Cobra 11" without highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about American reporters in the war who leave to spot a Serbian war criminal named "fox" could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not do and each time is a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when in the beginning we are introduced to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not let him simply be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of heads of the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It is so bad, that it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against film logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a profoundly human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić e Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned with pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, which hard is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it's hard to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Dranging Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good holocaust movie with the film "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some movies need more time. Classics such as the works on the Vietnam War "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because the script authors don’t have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" were in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
You may not have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general manager of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, said on Wednesday that he was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political momentum, sporting at the same level, could not be maintained."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in the organization of the Summer Olympics were not held until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust says at the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich’s request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity."
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too early to let the opportunity take away, if right now the plans are ruined," Günter Ploß, the HSB director, said Wednesday.
A resignation from the application is contradictory to the statement of the head of the Senate who made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sport of Higher Schools (Adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for the 2015 Universiadas not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of High Schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the application.
The German Social Democratic Party Fraction (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded integrated Olimpia planning for little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU underscored the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brillio-Box on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal research and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost one hundred of the others of "type"
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brightness-Boxes", he painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Glow" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, hundreds of cardboard boxes were exhibited in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Museet museum. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brightness" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but of specimens (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some Bright-wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of the fact that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Boxes" of "Stockhol-type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the curators of the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six museum-owned Brillio-Boxes and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and fraded their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brillio-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum and adds that if The “Andy Warhol Art” Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the exhibition copies/objects.”
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which it is boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered to a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that she could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been barricading themselves in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for trying a 2003 coup that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so suddenly he could deposit himself with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military policemen who were to watch him had passed into their ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councilor, condemned the soldiers’ behavior.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call people to get to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Big critics of government on Thursday called for a large demonstration against the president.
For months, his government has been rebuked for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
You have only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after Brendenberg bank increased its stake to Duesseldorf’s network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the equity for a third party.
United Internet already in the previous day made the telecom company Drillisch participate with almost 10 percent.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase placed 17.4 million of new shares that are worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on marketing cooperations for DSL-products.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration," United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded a company together MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not use their right, that is, they make 18.49 per hundreds of Freenet participate.
That meant that both companies kept all the options, especially the participation to the Freenet corporation.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the United Internet and Drillisch holding company directly had 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
They had then agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
