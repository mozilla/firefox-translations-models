European inflation slipped in food
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, is due in the first place to the dizzying growth in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after the 2.6 percent in the month of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only gave 3 percent as probable - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the North American, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to, two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: &quot;you have to negotiate&quot; on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro zone as a result of skyrocketing food and energy prices.
Wheat term prices increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, with the black gold already reaching almost 100 dollars a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while for 2009 it will drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent for the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats rose significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for the socialists.
The difference in the case of the secure voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) compared to the support of one fifth for the Socialists ( 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have a parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been higher, with 41 percent finding the country&#39;s economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation it&#39;s pretty bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
As regards next year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate and only a tenth expect an improvement.
In the month of December, 71 percent of those consulted, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the Prime Minister performs his duties more badly than well.
13 percent of those consulted trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
Whereas after the riots in October last year, 35 percent considered that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority ( 33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of those surveyed to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said that it is probable that they will participate.
By way of comparison, in &quot;general elections to be held this Sunday&quot; only 55 percent of the population would safely participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is probable. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the referendum.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying for study fees, 79 percent for the medical consultation service, and 84 percent for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco has quintupled its prices
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold business triangle maintained the average increase in the price level of 16 percent, with the difference that this year VAT was not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trading triangle, but growth was well above HUF thousand in all hypermarkets.
As in December of last year, prices in food supermarkets had already &quot;shot up&quot;, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below HUF 9,000, today they cannot buy for even HUF 10,000.
The Napi basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF by at least HUF 91.
And the basket with the highest value was 10,573 HUF.
(In the year 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, walnuts and poppy seeds.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coke with a redeemable two-liter bottle was less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, was only 257 HUF.
Still, in Napi Auchan&#39;s basket she was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
By our calculations, compared to last year&#39;s Christmas prices, Cora was up 15 per cent, while Tesco and Auchan were up about 18 per cent on Napi&#39;s basket prices.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of last year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year It&#39;s been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average growth in prices was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year the VAT increase was felt in prices.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly incapable of making a decision on the price margin to apply for each product and calculating the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the retailer misplans the velocity of a product&#39;s circulation, he or she may miss out on a significant margin profit that adjusts for sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the VAT increase, that the most expensive was 1,720 HUF higher than the value registered in 2006, while the difference in the cheapest was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest one also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic growth in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer items grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some staple foods, registered a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
Thus, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product, which was already quite expensive last year compared to the base, only 10 percent was registered, in the worst case. of price increase.
By all accounts, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose drastic price increases even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the golden trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, the majority of consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all products, taking preserved food by pallet.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed in front of the checkouts at all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics.
The hygienic circumstances prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of the infections - affirms the doctor-head of the department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals you save even with disinfectants.
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An injured person from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after as a result of being infected with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body .
Until December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, physician-head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this amount of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been registered in hospitals, there is no information on the rest.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, that is to say Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of human beings carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (eg, sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once antibiotics are excessively or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly resistant to antibiotics and are rapidly contagious under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or sepsis, primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened organisms, in the elderly or in low-weight persons.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, these infections are commonplace in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
antibiotic resistant
&quot;These patients are isolated, nurses attend them in rubber gloves and a mask and there are adequate antibiotics for their treatment&quot; - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their bodies, but even then infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital-acquired MRSA infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances are not conducive to preventing the formation and transmission of multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals the taking of microbiological samples is not fashionable.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when visible MRSA infections in the patient already occur - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict orders for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
It is necessary to insist that antibiotic therapy be directed, that is, microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always comply with this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples is even less frequent in the case of ambulatory patients or in primary care - stated Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however considerable shortcomings are also experienced in hospitals in this regard.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people; however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What&#39;s more, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often close together, although in order to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, one can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with a less favorable economic situation, savings are made with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater chance of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate prevention measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are registered or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, which is why it is fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
The breathalyzer control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident was negative
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district has been made.
The possibility that the since-resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passer-by, was driving drunk or in a dazed state - Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Capital Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, reported on Friday , after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary breathalyzer test, which had already verified that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning onto Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district ran over a 55-year-old man, who tried to cross the street, but not in the designated area for pedestrians
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the crosswalk to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always give way when turning.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
Due to what happened, the district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor&#39;s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation from the beginning.
400 million euros more for infrastructures
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements on Friday in Budapest for a total value of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, which will be carried out from the subsidy of the cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement for a value of 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit contract of 150 million euros is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be made later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
An agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes the details of the Metro financing with the EU, they will return to the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this could take place as early as the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth €8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a commission for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and chalets on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the &quot;Golden Coast&quot;, the &quot;Sun Coast&quot;, the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the environs of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being able to be an outstanding destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the clients are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They demand good communication and access, and the proximity of a big city, shops and generally a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included among the first 10 vacation destinations of the Germans).
The third group is made up of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly growing, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official opening, the negotiations will continue at the ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap that provides for efforts after the emission reduction period, established in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
Lively discussions on the subject are currently taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach an agreement that compared to the situation in 1990, by the year 2020 the emission of gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent. responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries that need it.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of directors made up of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the &quot;Piac és Profit&quot;.
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU&#39;s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its gas emissions, responsible for the greenhouse effect, by 20 percent compared to the 1990 level by 2020, regardless of whether or not the &quot;post-2012 agreement&quot; will be signed and is willing to commit to a reduction of even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 promised to reduce by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU Member States promised to comply with an 8 percent reduction.
Hungary&#39;s commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with respect to the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will comply with - indicates the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this In the event the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was noted in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the UN that deals with the climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and an increase of more than 2o C in the Earth&#39;s average temperature could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: the special units posted in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are monitored at the Kandahar headquarters, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their &quot;channel&quot; has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 under the name &quot;defense headquarters&quot; and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the British Commonwealth Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the forces Multinationals in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the British military&#39;s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruiting television spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead they inevitably carry some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d&#39;être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned by the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the &quot;official&quot; propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak as a maximum of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
Furthermore, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only lately taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting with the free downloadable shooting games called America&#39;s Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the shoes of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
The labor minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a work meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with a salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
The State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On Orphans&#39; Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and on Missionaries&#39; Christmas, the relatives of soldiers who are currently on missions abroad are invited. There will also be a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected to attend.
A Christmas atmosphere will reign at the portfolio party, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday at the National Council of Justice Administration (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent for the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development from community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we were unable to contact the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance on Lucía&#39;s day on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the words of greeting from the minister and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to [origo]&#39;s question, they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
The health, work and local administration portfolios are preparing for some modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests will be participating, who - as reported by the press department - will only have coffee and a salty pastry, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own assembly hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20, Christmas will not be celebrated at the Ministry.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the ministry, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
The press department of the environment portfolio could not report on the budget for the Ministry&#39;s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited to the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers&#39; Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will surely cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 pm the workers of the Public Transport Company of Budapest will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that they will celebrate jointly with the National Federation of Workers&#39; Commissions.
Likewise, the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will be constituted, which will coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike for an indefinite period, if an agreement is not reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report the date of the end of the strike that had begun.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their strike call.
On the other hand, if the law is approved, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on Monday&#39;s agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on very late at night, or perhaps close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, significant transport difficulties will have to be reckoned with: the railways will stop working indefinitely, part of the public transport in Budapest may stop in the morning and more of the half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the highways.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League&#39;s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a definite period.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as Christmas approaches, more and more people are They travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1:00 p.m. the workers of the Public Transport Company of Budapest will be on strike, those of Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators&#39; Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will declare a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS), which are part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal regarding the reform of public health and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway lateral lines and awaits a different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk for Hungary and the region.
In the company&#39;s &quot;risk warning&quot; it is written: in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that &quot;with the aggravation of existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary , even in the short term there may be violent ethnic confrontations&quot;.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: &quot;the protagonists of public life ceded the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base his political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians&quot;.
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists and increases the probability of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, &quot;significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country&quot;.
They remind us that: starting in the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and impetus, and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations calling themselves &quot;associations of national self-defense&quot;.
&quot;The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State&quot; - they add.
They affirmed: all this is produced in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
Well, highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy at the same time.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighborly relations.
&quot;In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger in numerous neighboring states, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by creating the Hungarian Guard. ,.
All this influences the political stability of the region&quot; - they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization&#39;s objective is &quot;national self-defense.&quot;
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was &quot;Gypsy terror&quot; in Bulgaria, however the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has caused a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will form their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian Home Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the Roma in Hungary will react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The director of research at Political Capital, Attila Juhász, when asked by the news agency, stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a general practice that around the holidays - which will be fewer next year - the working hours are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America are the parties unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and public holidays.
The festive days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical events.
We celebrate the New Year as well: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are festive - the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written in red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and on October 23, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1 the labor festival, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day festivals.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why bridges are often made when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for long weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor that regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or following the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for public employees and officials.
On the other hand, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the order of work can only be altered around the end of the year festivities: from December 24 life in the country practically stops, since according to experience, most people &quot;make a bridge&quot; during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with the middle or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First, the agenda around the labor party will be modified so that later, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return, Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the party on October 23: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday the 24th.
On the other hand, next year during the end of the year party you will be able to rest, since from December 24 you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to make your colleagues&#39; lives miserable
Emails we forget to send, audible messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: they are all part of our daily Folklore&quot; at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to small annoyances or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know that the marketing department wanted you&quot; - says one of your colleagues&quot;.
That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t go on a date?
At best they are sorry and try to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that they forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth thinking about the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to take a document, an office tool or your phone and you can&#39;t find it.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but this morning it disappeared?
Did you find your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don&#39;t take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightfully be mad at you for taking their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or post-its from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Do you gossip about your colleagues&#39; private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (guesses) that you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don&#39;t abuse your colleague&#39;s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know about him.
Are you going on unjustified sick leave?
When you phone the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think about what others should do your work, your tasks that cannot be postponed, your work by term.
Don&#39;t bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that you will not go to the office the next day or something could happen to you, for which you will have to stay at home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to deal with your absence the next day.
Hums, giggles, phone calls
Are you immersed in your work, but you are abruptly pulled out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a telephone conversation that it would have been better not to listen to?
Do not annoy your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (except when you do it over their head), kicking your feet, constant profanity, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if you&#39;re not delving into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don&#39;t blame others if you haven&#39;t finished something on time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don&#39;t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your lack!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don&#39;t be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange measure sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Turn up the volume.
The rhythm of the music changes and the bass is added to the previous tones and then the voice of a female choir like a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you&#39;re listening to Zagar&#39;s new record.
Yonderboy appears. Some new and interesting songs from the national digital underground are gradually changing the image and although garage-style rock, breaking guitars, is back in fashion, national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career, perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The ensemble, which initially performed only in small clubs, was introduced to the wider public when wan2 magazine selected their first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as almost the only national trendsetter. , capable of being sold in western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The group reacted as it should react: they prepared a new and even better record.
The recently released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Well, this title was one of the lines of the old set by Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, to the flight is fine, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs, György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the group The Puzzle, presented the album at the Millenáris.
The disc includes a real hit from the mr2 Petõfi channel, which lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivas Underground&quot;).
Well, everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: to what extent is the music you are performing dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select public means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can equally be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the West of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen and twenty year old generations attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public&#39;s expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don&#39;t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, we trust each other&#39;s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with Yonderboi&#39;s music, since many of us started our careers in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar&#39;s name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up to a broader layer with this style?
Zs.B.: We didn&#39;t intend to write great hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is something more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea to create this choir of well-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
This is how this choir of six women was created - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord drew the song.
Still that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came pretty much on the first try and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was super excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn&#39;t have worked as strongly.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay&#39;s brief solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than the music, so the music doesn&#39;t just accompany their singing.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Willfully?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about us forgetting our ego for a while, the one who, where has he come from and where is he going, let&#39;s let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you put in the most work on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition, really none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma in which I&#39;m playing on a concert piano or Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn&#39;t want to work for a long time and then little by little everything fell into place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with concerts and because I have already &quot;released&quot; the record.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions because of his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems more that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good abilities.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
&quot;He has a fragile character&quot; was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel&#39;s answers, according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to to their businesses.
Crisis not only in America
&quot;All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank,&quot; he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
He already saw this opportunity coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages being offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past, and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn&#39;t buy it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1,600 million euros.
&quot;When I already won my first 500 million, I didn&#39;t know how to report it,&quot; Kerviel confesses, adding that he hasn&#39;t left anything for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he declared that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even fooled the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk turned into benefit
Was he afraid it would be found out?
Rather not.
&quot;I thought that I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.&quot;
Where did he get so much willpower to risk himself like that?
In my position you had to work gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in the year 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between 51,000 dollars.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Even so, he knew that he was never going to win as much as the others.
&quot;In my first interview in 2005 I already noticed that they were looking at me cautiously.
Due to my training and also my professional and personal progress,&quot; Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after I joined the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he won, during the bombing attacks in London, gambling a title of 500 million euros on the downside.
And this was a starting mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
&quot;This is like a snowball,&quot; police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
&quot;While earning money, they closed their eyes.&quot;
Only, then, the coup came at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of him.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
&quot;I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn&#39;t have a vacation is a runner who doesn&#39;t want anyone to take a look at his file&quot; concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is practically half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will come out of seven operational programs for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about SEK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Program is the largest of the operational programs and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources for business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
When it comes to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newcomers that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the country&#39;s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for embezzling 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from jail to go under house arrest at his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not at all clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is once again behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they send him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Alemán constantly transferred government money to a company account in Panama.
This company was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest relatives and supportersT.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how our budget was approved
That&#39;s how it is.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first prepared by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year&#39;s budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and item in the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and for this reason they dedicate special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as the expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the &quot;silent&quot; ČSSD coalition. and KSČM.
The second one is the deficit in the economy as a consequence of the first defect.
The third limit is the public financing deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the deficit of the State Budget.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is found in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and bank loans, often senselessly issued bonds with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and through privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which ČSSD boasts about.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, except for some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that, within global measures, are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and the pension reform do not change soon, then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs only it will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
For this reason, this year&#39;s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not squandered in the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only civil servants, so we must be patient and concede to this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, tranquility for the preparation of other legal reforms.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Market, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through bidding.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of September 11, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
&quot;This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the ever-growing scarcity of free capital that banks could lend,&quot; Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, wrote in his report for clients.
&quot;This coordinated action by central banks probably lowered the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on bad loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
&quot;Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them still when they decided to take this step,&quot; said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
&quot;It seems that the situation is really bad,&quot; he added.
The central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that for this reason they will have to lend more expensive to their clients.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as the Central Banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times in the autumn.
&quot;It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the housing market in the US.
Klaus: The ecologists&#39; debates are amazing
Global climate change affects mainly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
Criticism now arose with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the ecologists&#39; debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality, is unacceptable.
&quot;There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,&quot; said Klaus.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, &quot;many times I only find myself with the caricature of my ideas.&quot;
Now those interested can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus reminded himself that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
In the main moment of the closing ceremony, he expressed his thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious. , nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against &quot;reasonable defenders of the environment, but against militant environmentalists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.&quot;
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people did not manage to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year there will be hundreds of thousands of drivers on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the towns they announce a rapid decrease in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and the interest for the new card has increased.
The City Council calculates around 2,000 daily customers.
Waiting in the queues is half an hour.
In Prague about 140,000 drivers have not yet obtained the new license.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their license and do not have enough until the end of the year, but will take to the roads without a valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can fix the infraction with a warning.
In case of an administrative infraction, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of a thousand crowns, maximum.
According to the spokesperson for the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, fines of one thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver&#39;s license is a document in which people can decide if they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will gradually have to change the other types of driving licences.
People with the document between the years 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdych&#39;s accomplices detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as final expiration the reduction of the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
Against today&#39;s decision can no longer be appealed, only by reversal by the High Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him first.
Despite this, in other processes he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You cannot receive more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the superior court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the defendants were rejected by the investigation as they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped the members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Regarding the robbery, its victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permit.
In the house search, the police found some pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser aimer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still testifying in other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their handing over to the authorities in the Czech Republic.
An account to change some children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns in compensation from the Třebič hospital plus court costs.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We do not approve such a demand, it is too high,&quot; said Dostál after today&#39;s meeting.
&quot;In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We&#39;ll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone,&quot; Dostál stressed.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň&#39;s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba used the specialist&#39;s report as the basis for negotiating compensation, except that it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better borne by the men, although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were exchanged by the nurses at the Třebič Maternity Home last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákovýs in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
At the end of October, the governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital that the region runs.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask the administrator for help.
The court until today recognized them a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Wallachian Kingdom trademark.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court, it was the first to use the Kingdom of Wallachia brand, but the project was created over many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear today at the oral hearing.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
&quot;The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites on Bolek Polívka&#39;s popularity,&quot; Polívka&#39;s lawyer said after the trial.
For him, at the words Kingdom of Wallachia, the image of the actor and comedian comes to everyone.
Harabiš also has the same idea.
&quot;We have been behind us for about ten years of work.
Pursuit of money and invention of activities,&quot; he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in money.
&quot;After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for this I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites on our work,&quot; he added.
a lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian Kingdom trademark was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it was not a question of guiding him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comical origin a lucrative business and entrepreneurial activity resulted, from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also found that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
&quot;It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,&quot; said the judge.
He added however that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have dedicated themselves completely to it.
The collaboration, between the now broken parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment conflicts began to occur between Polívka and Harabiš, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of &quot;King Boleslav I, the forever chosen one&quot;.
The main role in the kingdom, through the mediation of Harabiš, resulted in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In the year 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his company that until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabiš is already preparing.
The new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal even more data or dates.
&quot;We&#39;re not in a rush.
It would have to be something like the king&#39;s road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can come forward,&quot; added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell the truth, I have never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its driving characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, handling and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think better of it.
When I tested the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
flying around the world
I go through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value design invention more even though the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, gone are the days when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the 206 model, lateral steering has been greatly improved.
And the space? And here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
I must rate this as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let&#39;s stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters, which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the pram its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive, then I must mention the floor, which is quite flat after folding down the second row&#39;s backrests.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition with a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1600 that disparages the familiar five-door should look like.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it with the days of the škoda back then that looked as if the exhaust pipe was clogged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
prices respond
The price of the car is not for all budgets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headrests, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
That&#39;s a lot, but factor in the team add-ons on the Fabia and you&#39;ll come up with a pretty close number.
Now all that remains is to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and therefore, the locals fear more changes in the schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only brings a series of problems.
Even British schools register those cases where the conflicts between the emigrants and the children of the natives escalate in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants begin to grow.
Arguments, extortion and fights between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovakian woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense, he said that the girl was insulting his son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls showered him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
&quot;When we were going home, a guy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave it, he made a gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he dropped his pants and showed us his butt&quot; described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovakian student.
The complaints are from both parties.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools begins to be quite tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Great Britain who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
las palmeras and all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice creams or a variety of cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island in the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does he find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and loading port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew at the end of the 20s.
It was ordered to be built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba such as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
His guests included, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tall buildings arose in Havana, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Havanan Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those already cult cars from the 50s continue to function in Havana to this day, because those Ladas and Fiats that arrived a long time ago have oxidized in these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating remarkably, there are not as many marvelous colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the Holguín province and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for tens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models in other parts of the world can only be found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for the majority of visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone rock pylons and steeply elevated rocks at the falls of the valley, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocky areas are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco in Cuba is grown.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone will find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinity
City of old ancestry that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth turned into beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later arriving French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a secluded place that even in the 1950s there was no road connecting it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed either, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to spend in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the Casa de la Música, which enlivens the morning silence with its music.
baracoa
Small city in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two highways that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern part of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Pines, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves All this could fill many pages.
However, as they say, better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to the American defense minister, Robert gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not turning out as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time that the conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert gates, encouraged NATO forces to be more active, Great Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
&quot;Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development,&quot; defense minister Des Browne told BBC radio.
ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data from the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
The NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, a quarter of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
&quot;We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
In a similar sense, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
&quot;I am not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is not enough,&quot; De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
who is passive
Among the countries that have attended in recent months, the controversy prevails as to whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
&quot;The Germans have in Afghanistan a relative number of replacements.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands to fight there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country,&quot; Gates said.
The tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
&quot;Afghan rebels find out Germans are playing while our boys are fighting,&quot; Sun wrote in material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph of the British troops playing a rugby game in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach one trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crownsV.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the economic performance of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of economy confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the entire past year the state borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
&quot;For now it seems that thanks to next year&#39;s low deficit we could cross the trillion crown border by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns,&quot; Patria Finance economist David Marek told the server iHNed.cz.
The Next Finance economist, Vladimír Pikora, also sees it in a similar way: &quot;We could pass a trillion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don&#39;t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene is seen to change and politicians are able to save, then it could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don&#39;t see such a change,&quot; he added.
doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called tradable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroons z since June it was reduced by 13.7 billion kroons.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
&quot;Total debt year-over-year from the first to the third quarter grew 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that the growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that they are going to negotiate until there is a pension reform,&quot; commented Pikora.
better than expected
From the strategy of payments and management of the state debt for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend itself 159,200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement in the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is made up, above all, of the state budget deficit, which this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns in loan payments from the European investment bank.
He compared today in front of a court to Khartoum to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British professor tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The Britannica was accused of having allowed students from 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was subject to a penalty of lashing.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her 6/7 year old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
&quot;Eight names come out of the children&#39;s mouths, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed&quot;, says the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption &quot;My name is Mohamed&quot;.
The bear itself did not bear any tag with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons&#39;s Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and would never have done anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, &quot;I&#39;m just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name&quot;, according to him it is only an &quot;innocent mistake&quot;.
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as &quot;very attentive to her students&quot; and &quot;who never talks about religion in class&quot;.
Let&#39;s remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we for example give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute&quot;, declared the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was &quot;at stake&quot;, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
&quot;We do not foresee violence for now, but we are entering a very difficult period,&quot; he added, noting that &quot;obvious tensions exist.&quot;
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council, between now and December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing the negotiations beyond this deadline.
&quot;Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,&quot; Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners see independence under European Union supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not rule in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
&quot;Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,&quot; announced the president of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these &quot;last chance negotiations&quot; have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has shared his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade &quot;belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations.&quot;
&quot; Domino effect &quot;
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province&#39;s independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a &quot;domino effect&quot; in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
&quot;For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.&quot;
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
&quot;The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word&quot;
&quot;Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia&quot;, had declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
&quot;These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. &quot;
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that &quot;the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status&quot;, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made &quot;in consultation&quot; with the Westerners.
Bush pulls off a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference convened by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He specified that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with a view to finding a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a &quot;peace treaty&quot; before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle &quot;terrorist infrastructures&quot; and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush declared, reminding both sides of their obligations regarding the peace roadmap they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would try &quot;to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including the central issues.&quot;
This name covers the three main sticky issues at the point of contention between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be &quot;global and in-depth&quot; and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security , among other things &quot;.
Rising to the rostrum on his return, Olmert promised that the coming negotiations would be &quot;direct and continuous&quot; and to make &quot;an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008&quot;.
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of his &quot;vision of two States&quot; Palestinian and Israeli that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had gotten a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks &quot;a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because the roots of the conflict and its central aspects are attacked&quot;, estimates Prince Saud in his interview with Saudi capitals in an Arab newspaper.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What precisely happened, last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of event, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 p.m., Rue Luisa-Miguel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
&quot;He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating beacon,&quot; explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, &quot;not approved, that is, not authorized to circulate on public roads&quot; (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated &quot;at full throttle&quot;.
&quot;He struck the police car on the left side, after failing to give way to the right,&quot; the police said.
The breathalyzer control performed on the occupants of the vehicle was found to be negative.
The state of the car (the front part knocked out, windshield cracked, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the attorney for the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for &quot;acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance&quot; to the IGPN, in consultation with the departmental direction of security Public of Val-d&#39;Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who met on Sunday afternoon, confirmed &quot;the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left&quot;.
Yesterday, a type of groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck long enough for the police car to come to a stop.
The vehicles have been seized and are going to be the subject of a technical survey.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen had left the place very quickly, thus not providing assistance to both young people.
THE IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside &quot;any serious fault&quot; concerning this point.
&quot;It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, on which you have to be very prudent,&quot; said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
&quot;We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them, this witness says.
There was nothing to do &quot;.
Then he saw &quot;a completely terrified policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the aid arrived &quot;about twenty minutes after the policemen had left.&quot;
They also practiced heart massage, to no avail.
&quot; I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firemen arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,&quot; stressed the attorney for his part.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers who were demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone throws, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers&#39; movement gathered support on Monday from the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president &quot;urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and waste to the who took the oath in front of Musharraf.&quot;
&quot;Musharraf&#39;s promise no longer keeps&quot;
The Pakistani Supreme Court is referred directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The president of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
&quot;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,&quot; the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president &quot;is no longer valued&quot; after the establishment of the state of emergency, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem declared on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform between now and November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Still today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is unplanned, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law was voted to liberalize contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception allowed, however, a better &quot;control of fertility&quot;, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years of age has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated more or less every month for one couple in five and if possible for spring, the season judged to be the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of station.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments &quot;botched&quot; by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module for the production of electricity with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began rearranging the module&#39;s solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged by a little more or less than a meter by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment has been stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who had at first to carry out a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to work on the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go caracole at the end of the 30-meter long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best &quot;spacewalker&quot; (space walker) of NASA.
Tall, resistant, very skilled, he has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to &quot;operate&quot; the &quot;injured&quot; solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of &quot;slats&quot; in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who had stayed near the airlock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, was conceived and &quot;tinkered&quot; by astronauts aboard the station.
With the operation complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to fully deploy before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS share is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M .
EADS currently loses 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of engine development for the A400M, which sets up the aircraft&#39;s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, amounts to &quot;between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus,&quot; announced the parent company. of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It must be remembered that the operational result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, essentially because of charges linked to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group envisioned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, after the polls: the Russians are going to massively vote for President Putine&#39;s party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses voters today a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in the capacity of leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to be revealed by receiving the foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,&quot; he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign sullied by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says there have &quot;never been such dirty elections, even in Eltsin&#39;s time.&quot;
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion of checkmate Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
&quot;The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus&quot;
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; Candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is ineligible for a third consecutive term.
So no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful United Russia party that would choose the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative elections as well as in the presidential ones, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
&quot;The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny&quot;, estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of Saint Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society in this Christianized country was five centuries behind Europe; the famous spirit of community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, &quot;Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief&quot;, estimates María Lipman, from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians &quot;willingly renounce personal responsibility&quot; for whom they had briefly given proof after the outbreak of the USSR.
&quot;Why reflect?&quot;
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: &quot;Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them? &quot;
a heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
Until now, the 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only available for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes, that is to say individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or of their successors.
The eleven States in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them up to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective as of yesterday.
sensitive information
Historians&#39; access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to search &quot;particularly on the movements of the prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers&quot;, explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to opening these registered documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or forced compatriots and, eventually, provide them with proof of their internment. in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
&quot;There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,&quot; Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin, had declared in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India&#39;s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The foreign affairs ministers of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (EFA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeastern Nations Asian (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already amounts to about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India&#39;s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its number one foreign investor, but India is only the European Union&#39;s 9th largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
&quot;A free trade pact will greatly improve both economies&quot; and &quot;India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans&quot;, justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner. The Asian and European giants trade annually for &quot;47 billion euros of goods&quot; and for &quot;10 billion euros of services,&quot; Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, had declared this week, feeling that bilateral trade &quot;has not yet reached its potential&quot;. The European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10bn in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current round of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a £10bn offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer lasting unusual.
&quot;To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank has the intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,&quot; it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market like this on December 6 at 12:15 p.m. GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
It seems to be the first time that the English bank BoE has put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that &quot;it is prepared to take other measures to keep the rates&quot; of interbank loans up to date in line with its base rate.
The interbank index to the day was on Wednesday of 5.829%.
The index after three months settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were matched to a significant penalty rate which had discouraged banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, at the most advantageous indexes and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the proposals of the PS party on purchasing power
The UMP group and the Nouveau Center refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist &quot;niche&quot; (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a check-transportation or the restrictions of the rents.
Since the UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and the opposition a few hours after the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the rectifying finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn&#39;s Festival Republic.
&quot;For our company, it&#39;s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less, the current festival movement in America,&quot; C3&#39;s Charlie Jones confided to Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago&#39;s Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as the Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, Festival Republic created Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also handled production, licensing and organizational duties for the Glastonbury Festival, which can now hold up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the &quot;most inspiring event&quot; he has ever attended, C3&#39;s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn&#39;s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
&quot;We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and were working hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
&quot;We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in menial politics because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place, ultimately taking place in Philadelphia.&quot;
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in 2005 in Chicago&#39;s Grant Park, after breaking out on the festival scene in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events posted respective grosses of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
&quot;Melvin Benn&#39;s European model is a country festival, whereas ours is more in urban parkland,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way. &quot;
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports holding this event,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but affirms &quot;that they are quite interesting to allow us to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life.&quot;
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer for this festival is &quot;very large&quot;, following the example of the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
&quot;Vineland will have a rock flavor, but the music will be varied there, hoping to appeal to all kinds of audiences,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
His C3 mates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal stands up to the Terminator
It&#39;s not easy luring Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when nothing but the Terminator stands against it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - &quot;politically difficult&quot; because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the &quot; runaway productions &quot;.
Is it difficult to compete with the &quot;Governator&quot;?
&quot;You have to be prudent, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are going to judge the best ones&quot;, he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte&#39;s priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The race to the Oskars is started.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it be Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and ensure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is out in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also submitted four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the crisis &#39;subprime&#39;
With less than five weeks to say goodbye to the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will occur.
Banif believes that &quot;from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market tends to have a positive behavior.
However, it is not convenient to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.&quot;
Although they are not in favor of the stock market picking up a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that &quot;the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected due to the flight effect towards quality values in both long and short stretches&quot;.
For this reason, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility &quot;above all because the impact of the probable decrease in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulus from inflationary pressures.
Javier Barrio, BPI&#39;s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be a rally.
&quot;The thing is not for many joys,&quot; says the expert.
The Ibex has lost close to 4% since the highs set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert qualifies that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be brought forward to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that the volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and &quot;therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, affirms that &quot;this year it is the turn of the great values&quot;.
The expert would include the two large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio &quot;because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive.&quot;
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, assures that the increases will come from the banks and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
&quot;ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC follow the same path,&quot; explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a bear month twice.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, the year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 branches 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. .
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular&#39;s experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports store hours.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, the self-employed and businesses on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 branches open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers in the different streets.
In this way, the extension of hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design, with brighter colours.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although it does require more staff, since it goes from having about six employees per store to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches on Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that they were right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in immigrants, also with very long hours, even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax stores they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to compete with our customers,&quot; says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with personnel from outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We did it&#39;.
With that phrase, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he directs was doubling the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: &quot;it&#39;s what hurts me, it&#39;s not because we&#39;ve grown more but because we&#39;ve fallen less,&quot; he said.
Even so, he stressed that in a weak market, &quot;we have fallen less.&quot;
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
This gain places its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which lost 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that &#39;we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are capable of doing, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience&#39;.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group&#39;s advertising.
If this announced data becomes true, the television channel would register an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing this year compared to the 965.4 million of the year 2006.
For its part, the net invoicing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (until reaching 734.4 million) while the net income of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 millions).
One of the factors that analysts point to for Telecinco&#39;s better relative performance on the stock market is the high payout it has maintained up to now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
&#39;We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with 33% of Endemol&#39;.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of a certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the fact that forecast revenue growth has been cut from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast for Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) due to the &#39;attractive multiples&#39; and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases as they have &quot;similar threats&quot; (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
Parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups coincided in highlighting the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Law, entails the modernization of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulations will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and individuals or legal entities and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs), which join stock brokerage firms , brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are added to the multilateral trading systems and the order internalization systems, which will compete with the current stock managers.
The Law also obliges investment service companies to disclose to the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it stands out that securitized debts are considered a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument given their high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the US subprime mortgage debt.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can carry out 30 years after the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for others, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a preview of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) of offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is for guidance only, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
&quot;The CPI will continue at relatively high levels&quot;
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the 4.1% rise in the CPI in November is a &quot;temporary figure&quot;, but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at &quot;relatively high&quot; levels &quot;in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that &quot;although the figure is not good&quot; the inflation differential in Spain with respect to the monetary union continues to be &quot;more or less&quot; the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November &quot;there has been less surprise&quot; than in the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a high rise.
&quot;We were expecting a figure of around 4%&quot;, the Economy Minister acknowledged with respect to the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42,000 million euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it entered into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, it amassed record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the distrust of its clients and despite the one hundred percent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the entity under its Virgin Money financial trademark, needs to capture around a quarter of UK bank deposit revenue over the next three years to raise the remaining £18bn to reach the £30bn target. millions.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its flashy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and who according to sources of the investigation consulted by Cadena SER, could be the &#39;ringleader&#39; of this plot.
The agents continue to search the municipal offices and the Urban Planning Department and more arrests are not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported by Cadena SER yesterday, the lawyer of the &#39;popular&#39; deputy Juan Morales, therefore registered, was arrested leaving Morales&#39; home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Organization Secretary of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because &quot;it is important to have the best&quot; in political life and Bono &quot;is among the best.&quot;
In addition, he has pointed out that &quot;it does seem&quot; that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to stand in the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change at the university level.
The former minister has recognized that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he has indicated that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an &quot;act of transparency.&quot;
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the Chamber into &quot;the house of respect and not of insults or shouting.&quot; and make it &quot;look more and more like citizens&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you cannot speak calmly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government was interrupted 26 times in the Senate on a certain occasion.&quot;
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and &quot;his good work&quot; and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has indicated, his adversaries could see as &quot;arrogance&quot;.
climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change mercilessly persecutes both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron consistency.
And even more so a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and he even intends to sign a &quot;new contract with the planet.&quot;
This approach forces him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government have contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why your government, the one with the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he is going to take to stop climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But neither have there been nor will there be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, cumbersome, and threatening to business and individual accounts.
Even the cent for gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it limits itself to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not expect us to travel by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local Totana Police have been arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the &quot;popular&quot; José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the City Council secretary and a hotelier for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today .
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Town Hall, in whose premises he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Town Planning Department and the municipal company for the management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rural land for development so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are accused in the summary, which is instructing the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have gone to court today.
As reported by sources, the former councilor of Totana and today a regional parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who lives in the capital of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo Manuel NA, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José MG, director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which they would have made the bribes.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operating Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested then in Totana, specifically, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with spas.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were reclassified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks on Calle Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment from yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (incidentally at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what was published on November 18, the same day when, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn&#39;s book appeared there:
&quot;The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The person responsible for the deaths, a high school student, cited the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes &quot;.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Penal Code of Internet download crimes:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records worth less than 400 euros from the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than that imposed on unloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to be involved in a fight than to be involved in exchanging compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous fight has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is punished more than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is getting too far, too long.

My GP hands me one of his weird research articles entitled: &#39;Money triggers brains, especially if others get less.&#39;
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&amp;Brain Institute in Germany: &quot;The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.&quot;
The researchers observed that if both received the same payout when both guessed correctly, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don&#39;t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans from the prosecutor&#39;s office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still in power. freedom.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, &#39;Carla&#39;s list&#39; (2006, not released in Spain) takes its title, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to track down the fled criminals and put pressure on the governments involved to tighten their noose.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of this one, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it. , among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices based on statistics, so that the greater the probability of suffering an accident, the greater the fee to pay.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, using the tallies, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age encounter various inconveniences when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is comprehensive insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk with excess, so that they obtain the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the claim.
&quot;The part of the amount of the claim that the client contributes will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,&quot; specifies Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the client ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against damage caused to his own car.
In addition, you would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company has.
By contrast, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fare.
&quot;The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses&quot;, clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when it comes to taking out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an all-risk franchise.
&quot;Normally, young people cannot make use of the previously acquired experience when dealing with an accident, and even when driving,&quot; says the director in Spain of the European company, to which he adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the &#39;newbie&#39;s fear&#39; has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that they negotiate all-risk insurance, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, married couples with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with an excess (this could be 300 euros), or, when there is a high level of bonus, one for third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle&#39;s life.
&quot;They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise,&quot; says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, an all-risk insurance with excess is recommended (this being 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the round of 16
Milan and Celtic meet this Tuesday at the San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the &#39;Champions&#39; league, since it helps the Italians to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified their pass on matchday five with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that they host Benfica, who have four , do not advance.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, since Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they make their debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final on the 16th. .
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that by winning he would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the round of 16.
Gordon Strachan&#39;s team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but they cannot be trusted because at nine points the pass goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanistas will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who hope to get into the round of 16 for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 in the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the &#39;rossoneri&#39; will be the Shakhtar to which only victory is worth it, in the event that Celtic lose, both to get into the round of 16 and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), before some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
&#39;Posh Spice&#39; (Victoria Beckham), &#39;Scary Spice&#39; (Melanie Brown), &#39;Baby Spice&#39; (Emma Bunton), &#39;Sporty Spice&#39; (Melanie Chisholm) and &#39;Ginger Spice&#39; (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver&#39;s GM Place stadium that the group&#39;s reunion is &quot;brilliant.&quot;
Around 20,000 people sold out the tickets to attend the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that was all the rage at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, &#39;Headlines&#39; and &#39;Voodoo&#39;, which is published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls came out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of &#39;Posh Spice&#39;, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the public that packed the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria&#39;s nerves had prohibited him from doing so days before.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star &quot;hasn&#39;t seen our wardrobe at all, so I&#39;m nervous about what he&#39;s going to think of the show.&quot;
&#39;Sporty Spice&#39; whose departure from the group in 1998 &quot;because of the differences between us&quot; caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed her nervousness during a meeting with the press two hours before the start of the show.
&quot;I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I&#39;m glad I made the decision,&quot; Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, &quot;things have been fixed and we all love each other very much.&quot;
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
Between the five they add seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia&#39;s export of the fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
kyiv has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between kyiv and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, gas monopoly owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has agreed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
&quot;It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,&quot; Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
&quot;Changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.&quot;
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and kyiv, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which pushed prices up rapidly.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU&#39;s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS &quot;must test foreign workers&quot;
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black&#39;s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign personnel recruited from outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep outside the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
The NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal records checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Great Britain.
The auditor general&#39;s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
&quot;Although we did find some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review,&quot; the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: &quot;our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of foreign staff of the NHS.&quot;
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
&quot;The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value is of the recommendations made,&quot; he explained.
The Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the checking procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely adhered to.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the NHS foreign pre-employment policy and guidance.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon says: &quot;I had a vested interest in having this work done in the aftermath of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment screening guides for all work groups - including foreigners. what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including best film.
Trophies were also given to leading man Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller &quot;Notes from a Scandal.&quot;
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for bringing a British film to the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis&#39;s rise to fame with Joy Division, up to his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - which has a soundtrack by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2&#39;s Joshua Tree album, won two awards - for best director and best new director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - Julien Temple&#39;s film about The Clash frontman Joe Strummer won best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the chauffeur of a London Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg&#39;s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.&quot;
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
&quot;It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,&quot; he declared.
&quot;I was lucky to run into Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it&#39;s really an honor.&quot;
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants from terror cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world&#39;s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report stated.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world&#39;s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a &quot;missile launch expert&quot; that has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of those detained were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders to be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants, fighting allied forces and supporting the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by Sunni Saudis. more extreme.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many clergymen in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country&#39;s pro-Western government - targeted residences of foreign government associates, government buildings and energy facilities.
&quot;This was a great effort by the security forces, working for five months,&quot; the interior minister&#39;s spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person &quot;media cell&quot; in Medina whose aim was to promote &quot;takfiri thought&quot; - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes another 32 people accused of giving support and financial support to the militants.
Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more similar to an Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth habitable, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is eroded by hurricane force winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a picture of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: &quot;It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two planets so similar .
&quot;Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.&quot;
Police seize &quot;enriched uranium&quot;
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
still open
Mitt Romney says it&#39;s not dignified for presidential candidates to answer a snowman&#39;s questions.
However, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and submit them for broadcast among the candidates.
None of the questions submitted on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28, were more ridiculous than the one about the snow monkey asking Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube GOP debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party heading into next year&#39;s elections.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who are co-sponsoring the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the candidate candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest ever devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noted approval spikes when candidates made extremist arguments.
The harshest exchanges of the night came between Rudy Giuliani, the national trailblazer, and Mr. Romney, who has led the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney&#39;s reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate would support an &quot;amnesty&quot; (allowing illegals to regularize their status and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, won agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race, perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: increased surveillance at the borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This platitude, along with fears of China&#39;s toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned awkward when other issues came up.
Mr. Guiliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, in first place in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to run in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee rises in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul&#39;s fundraising campaigns, and his heated debate remarks on Wednesday.
They both have come from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not reach an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about great America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one isn&#39;t particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have been sold influences, nor is it exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor extramarital finger-licking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the ruling British Labor party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounced.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have pitted business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative botch.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers for the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it&#39;s the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labor general secretary (and former confederate) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don&#39;t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is unnecessary: civil servants begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn&#39;t focus.
In one part, Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he can&#39;t defend himself on the grounds that he&#39;s new.
Although he wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
Northern Rock&#39;s problems, and the authority registration tax, are related to decisions Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer.
And even if he&#39;s not directly involved in the Blairish mishaps - or &quot;cash for partners&quot;, the political party finance investigation - voters can assume he is.
However, Mr. Brown&#39;s situation is not as bad as it seems.
Gaffes aren&#39;t as bad as the Tories want to make them out to be.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has anyone been directly ripped off.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donations scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who likens his donations to charitable giving, says he doesn&#39;t want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of the agreement of mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr Brown is so far not implicated: there is nothing to suggest he knew of these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Also, there are other things that mr. Brown must do, like find a permanent, independent head of the Public Life Standards Commission, since he hasn&#39;t had one for six months, and he must also push for genuine party finance reform.
This will require some hard cooperative work by Labor with the Tories, and perhaps a relinquishment of special financial status with the unions - bitter moves for a partisan like mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way you can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competence.
sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there&#39;s blood in the water, it&#39;s natural for dorsal fins to swim around excitedly.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country&#39;s market for credit cards.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate credit card losses could be as high as $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and delinquency rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been paid off or that are more than 30 days past due respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 million charge on its American consumer financing business, partly because of weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early to panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody&#39;s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American personal bankruptcy law (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for the borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection from the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to load up on credit cards now that lenders are going bad.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than asset value, so falling prices don&#39;t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers&#39; creditworthiness.
They may even work to outperform issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying off the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, paying off card debt moves up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions from mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
&quot;We&#39;re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,&quot; says Gary Perlin, Capital One&#39;s chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime infection of the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If lower home prices and a credit crunch push America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in fraud with Enron&#39;s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty on seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was found guilty of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a cause célèbre in Britain over the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the weak end of an investigation launched after Enron&#39;s collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they tipped off Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the &quot;NatWest Three&quot; - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, which was the mastermind of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which aided its downward spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew that it would value upwards.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank&#39;s interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiring in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of Brits were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial took place.
Enron, one of the nation&#39;s seven largest companies, declared bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than 2 million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were indicted last year for their roles in the company&#39;s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay&#39;s sentence on conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
Pricing for a Gulfstream G550 jet, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
&quot;It seats up to 18 passengers,&quot; says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
&quot;But no one asks for that model with so many seats because it is for private family flights or for presidents of a company.&quot;
Mr. Firer was a Gulfstream booth manager last Friday at the Millionaire&#39;s Fair, a four-day drinking orgy held at an events center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury vendors had set up their exhibit booths, hoping to lure new wealthy Russians into everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer warily eyed a bright orange Porsche in the booth next to his.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful car, but it&#39;s nickel and bucks compared to us,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.&quot;
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was in its heyday.
&quot;We lived through the same thing in the 1890s, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,&quot; says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at Harvard University&#39;s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
&quot;Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world&#39;s biggest consumers and spenders.&quot;
The world&#39;s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their slice of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference is taking place this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires worth as much as $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, authored by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think thank local.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She is attending the fair for the first time together with the brand&#39;s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
&quot;The women are impeccably prepared and the men are very dignified.&quot;
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening dress, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
&quot;I was looking at the cars and I&#39;m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,&quot; said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the nouveau riche, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to spend several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknifes, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
&quot;Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and which is the best,&quot; said mr. Gijrath, sitting patriotically at a booth of Royal Dutch Delft Porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
&quot;Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.&quot;
In fact, sellers said that older wealthy Russians (10 to 15 years old, by Russian standards) have shifted their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which wouldn&#39;t be on display at a trade show.
Yet several thousand people—cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires, or tourists—fill the aisles each day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of the LA Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with spokes encrusted with colored Swarovski crystals to resemble a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,&quot; says mr. Karapetian.
&quot;He&#39;s going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars.&quot;
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase &quot;Russian millionaire&quot; does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
&quot;If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;
Those who weren&#39;t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich because of the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths stuffed with stacks of counterfeit million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking friends to take cell phone photos of them resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple million.
&quot;You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,&quot; says Karryev.
&quot;Sbotched&quot; surgery could cause one death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the &quot;A Little Healthier&quot; restaurant and saw an ambulance drive up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
&quot;Then I saw the ambulance come up,&quot; said mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
&quot;That&#39;s when I found out someone had died.&quot;
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by police, but who works at the home at 212 West Scott Ave.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but they are waiting for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has grieved the upper ranks of the Newark police force.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
&quot;She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,&quot; says mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
&quot;She was my guardian.&quot;
She protected me.&quot;
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
&quot;That&#39;s one of the possibilities,&quot; Walsh stated.
&quot;It&#39;s an ongoing investigation.&quot;
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the home&#39;s owner, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say if Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was used as a doctor&#39;s office.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro&#39;s home, where a withered rose bush stands at the front of the house and a barking Dalmatian at the back.
A blue drum labeled &quot;ethyl vanillin&quot; - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - stood at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was an invaluable help in learning about the new island city and its tough political culture.
&quot;She&#39;d say, &#39;You have to watch out for this one or that one,&#39;&quot; he said.
&quot;She was always here when I was there, and also when I wasn&#39;t.
It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;
The federal reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were raised on calming comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stocks loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke&#39;s number two Donald Kohn declared that policymakers must be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in responding to continued tension from financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets amid growing displays of credit sacks, mr. Kohn said the recent turmoil was &quot;partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and through October.&quot;
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and make subsequent interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by an announcement from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that it will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to find their way into London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39bn to the value of Britain&#39;s blue-chip companies.
Germany&#39;s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France&#39;s CAC40 was up 2.3%.
Earlier, the reappearance of credit stress in the markets was highlighted after strong demand in an auction of three-month funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the actions of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, put pressure on credit and three-month &quot;Libor&quot; lending rates among British banks, which It meant the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant rise since November 12.
England takes to court the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat the No.6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none the less in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan - with that particular title at least - is here to help Peter Moores, the manager, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part-time one.
The one who does not get the sixth place bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is not easy to throw away what a man at the top of his profession does, while another never gets beyond the bottom level, sometimes through lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, were to be promoted to the board: there&#39;s only room for one of them.
Who is to say what is a good standard for a cricketer, unless he is given the next chance to sink or swim?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batsman for chances to turn the order around if he is to make an impact as a player one day.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example James Anderson who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
Shah&#39;s or Bopara&#39;s games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
Choice can make or break a man&#39;s career, or it can make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first few, taking 5 wickets and a useful 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time, who rose to prominence. and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in today&#39;s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their self-preservation instincts and favor Shah&#39;s more experienced over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah&#39;s favor is his brilliant and valuable debut Test of early &#39;88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds to just 6 for Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling. .
But Shah made just ten runs in his two outings in May against the West Indies in the test at Lords, his Middlesex home, and that caused an immediate pushback from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, appearing to have taken of his batting something of élan that in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex team have joie de vivre in spades.
He has a crush on nothing on the cricket ground and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his car at a showroom for England&#39;s car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call out to Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching in the distance, to say excitedly: &quot; Did you see that?&quot;.
Bopara is the better player, he&#39;s including his slippery pass for effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which is not to say Shah won&#39;t excel, as the tea leaves suggest, he is the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of Syrian and Jordanian refugees who had returned by private transport.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,&quot; says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
&quot;I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I have read in the newspapers about what happened in Baghdad and that it is safe now.&quot;
&quot;They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,&quot; he says, referring to the Shi&#39;ite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his troops to halt temporarily.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shi&#39;ite and a teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria as the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to say that a US-allied force helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, urging him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal chief who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
&quot;Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s why I came back today,&quot; said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn by the growing calm in the capital since US troops entrenched groups of armed &quot;concerned citizens&quot; working cooperatively with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of the denial of visas and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to the suspicion common among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to come back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death gangs.
&quot;We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,&quot; the Sunni said.
&quot;I can&#39;t believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left it.&quot;
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, easing the tension.
There are fears that a sudden wave of refugees will spark sectarian tensions anew and start fighting.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is first in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlanders only lack an educational field.
&quot;Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French&quot;- that was the ironic moto on themselves of the smallest federal state for its centenary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the educational system of the Saarland which in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called &quot;Bildungsmonitor&quot; ranked fifth.
Thus, high schools traditionally have good relations with neighboring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a baccalaureate.
&quot;In Saarland the system of vocational education is used&quot;, says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute for German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate at the Vocational School. Thus, it turns out that the Saarland is 7 percent points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety and range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of Engineering Science graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to do more advertising for Engineering Science majors.
&quot;After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
So that the children start studying the last year of the project called &quot;Kita-Jahr&quot; as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model is also imitated by the other federal states.
Comparison with future studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlanders, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the Sarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez allows time to be changed in the South American country, turning the clock back half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will go to minus four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained Colombia&#39;s president.
&quot;My dignity does not allow me to do it,&quot; says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw Chávez&#39;s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas regarding the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision made by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chávez.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: &quot;Why don&#39;t you shut up?&quot; is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who felt annoyed by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
&quot;The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,&quot; Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research told the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;. of business cycles.
New unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the &quot;Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung&quot; newspaper that given the current situation, the intention to decrease the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for loans and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices to last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth&#39;s twin brother.
Despite its atmosphere not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that until now had not been considered. The European probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; discovered lightning in the atmosphere and eddies at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that lightning might exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning strikes from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;.
According to the famous Urey-Miller origin-of-life model, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
This is not the case on Venus: if there were ever to be life there, it would have to be in an early stage of evolution,&quot; explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
&quot;Possibly Venus is an &#39;evil&#39; twin of Earth, but it&#39;s still a twin,&quot; Russell said.
The main objective of the &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth due to its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for the investigation of this planet, the launch of &quot;Venus-Express&quot; in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The latest research results, which will be presented in many &quot;Nature&quot; articles, according to the researchers&#39; opinion, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
&quot;This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had previously assumed,&quot; the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered a faster rotating cloud vortex in the south polar region.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the Earth&#39;s high atmospheric layers at the poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute for Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as big.
This planet, also called the morning star or evening star, orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
Whereas on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel&#39;s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the bickering between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany&#39;s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end this fight over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
&quot;In this case we must not present ourselves as ONE divided nation,&quot; Koehler told the &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
&quot;Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely relevant to me,&quot; Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received for pursuing a new policy with China.
&quot;The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of the one-China policy.
China knows that too,&quot; Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the Dalai Lama&#39;s reception and was attacked by members of the Union for this.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s reception at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstanding in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources from the magazine &quot;Spiegel&quot;, froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China&#39;s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns of riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything possible be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not spill over into the streets.
Barricades were erected, vandals fired rifles at the police: Following serious youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
&quot;We have to ALSO make sure that the social problems of our country do not take a violent form.&quot;
&quot;We have to take that seriously,&quot; he told the &quot;Neue Presse&quot; newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working hard to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
&quot;From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruits.&quot;
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youngsters staged serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a copycat effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
We must ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: &quot;We have to give young people a perspective.&quot;
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France &quot;there is great social control in families&quot;, greater than in the French country.
Furthermore, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat opines: &quot;But despite everything, we have to be careful.&quot;
It is necessary to &quot;provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or professional training more quickly.&quot;
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been in charge of security.
After viewing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Home Affairs Minister, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The disturbance began due to a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor&#39;s office, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance of the Federal Chancellor, far from reality, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more can be expected from her.
But in which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was leveled at her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy activities, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House it was declared very clearly expressly to all that this reproach was appropriate.
You couldn&#39;t feel the slightest interest or any kind of feeling for the country&#39;s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself like this: a very lofty politician who runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
An example: the prevention of climate change: it praised itself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow herself such modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that an impulse reaches the people.
And in this way he damages his public image due to the pragmatic conception with which he solves problems without going around the bush.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about that topic using subordinate clauses.
It&#39;s amazing how many times he gets the wrong word when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble &quot;as if he had been in unfamiliar territory&quot;, when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, squared off in a heated YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates and now have only one candidate from the outside to fear.
From the beginning, the tensions between the candidates are noticeable.
Mitt Romney criticized his adversary Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into &quot;a place of refuge for illegal immigrants.&quot;
The latter, for his part, responded with serious reproaches: &quot;I would like to say that his own house was a &quot;port&quot; for illegals.&quot; Giuliani answers the ex-governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite so far, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, above all to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users and sent to Youtube, don&#39;t have much content either.
&quot;With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power&quot;, that was John McCain&#39;s reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from veterans of the Vietnam War, when he refuses to recognize &quot;Waterboarding&quot; as torture, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown to simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the increase in taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
&quot;At that time I was wrong,&quot; Romney explains ruefully and apologizes to the people and the television public for having been an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, by contrast, was at a loss for what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf governs without a uniform.
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
Thus ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, was sworn in for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general governs the state for the first time as a civilian head.
With his resignation from the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf is going to annul the state of emergency very soon and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was declared in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists who have been supporters of Musharraf. Last week the country&#39;s Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new head of government elections on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to information from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of &quot;Harmonia&quot; participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a revival, a copy of &quot;Live 1974&quot; was made, which was written in the best period of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused a sensation.
Each one of them has in front of him his little box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia returned to making music.
What needs to be revealed here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the name of the band reverberated in the minds of the people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can&#39;t the Germans also applaud their living legend from the 1970s?
Especially since the Kautrock equivocation was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an &quot;Echo&quot; music prize to the members of the Cologne band Can 2003 for their life work, the surprised faces of German pop artists could be seen in the hall.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone gasped in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would hang out on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of the Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for financial reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a small job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more like an artist&#39;s life full of surprises.
As they say, a Harmonia singing association pennant by Ottenstein turned up in the trash one day, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also drawbacks to using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called &quot;Musik von Harmonia&quot; and the second &quot;De Lux&quot;.
Despite the music being calm and simple, the band struggled financially.
Life as an artist was not just to know himself.
The CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Rother then expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against custom.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums like &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot;.
Cluster revived the eighties and since then has been more successful than Harmonia was.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, we have Groenemeyer to thank for that.
His music company Grienland set himself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution in order to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was rediscovered.
Harmonia&#39;s presentation as a band takes place in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot; manual.
There is also present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences from Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno&#39;s phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: &quot;This music is the only true music, the future belongs to it.&quot;
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than attach the microphones to the organ and drums so that they can produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices that they have built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is how it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment, people cough, whisper, and in a good moment of emphasis they sing &quot;Aaaaaaaah!&quot;.
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here yells &quot;68!&quot; He&#39;s also right, but Harmonia is calm now.
On stage one reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
That can break one&#39;s nerves or give away a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; and &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not very convinced.
Either the concepts focus too much on action and shooting or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; cannot help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his nice, minor roles in women&#39;s movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now all of a sudden Richard Gere is the biggest storyline to watch maybe the movie &quot;The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes the thing he&#39;s chasing&quot; (Why do movie titles have to be so long nowadays? and crazy?).
The film is a wonderful presentation to behold: at bottom, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the movie industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best days in life are long past, who like a monument to the ruin of his decadence had hitherto retained most of its charm.
&quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, despite this triumph, along with &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; which is the German production and will also be released this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb woman from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and it takes him also to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we are pleased that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series &quot;Alarm fuer Cobra 11&quot; without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; you can investigate, because there was never really a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another screenplay writer (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about wartime American reporters leaving to track down a Serbian war criminal called &quot;zorro&quot; could probably be a new &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go twice to the mountains to do something the army can&#39;t, and each time it turns out to be a wild ride.
One reason for the failure of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is when we are initially introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to just be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who is going to be killed later.
So &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world&#39;s headhunters could not achieve for five years. , which was to capture the war criminal and leave it to the Muslim Bosnians to exact their just revenge.
It&#39;s so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: &quot;In the large wrinkles on his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad.&quot;
In movies like &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are flops.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
A rule is almost always valid: when a star enters a region of crisis or minefields, something like &quot;Rangoon&quot; with Patricia Arguette, &quot;Across All Borders&quot; with Angelina Jolie or &quot;Bloody Diamonds&quot; appears. &quot;with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It will take at least decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust using the film &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; as an example.
Some movies already need more time. Classics like the Vietnam War works &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jackett&quot; were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
Today we perhaps know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times each massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that&#39;s because scriptwriters don&#39;t have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
&quot;To be or not to be&quot; or &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn&#39;t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don&#39;t have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel &quot;Lemprière&#39;s Dictionary&quot; and the war in the Balkans, he replied: &quot;That&#39;s only because some things never change.&quot;
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, declared this resignation on Wednesday as &quot;not good for the economic situation&quot;.
In recent times, no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
&quot;Without this objective, the political and sports momentum could not be maintained at the same level.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz urged the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application &quot;that refers to another time.&quot;
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stood by his statements that Hamburg&#39;s ambitions to host the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
&quot;Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides,&quot; says von Beust in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) that is expected in early December, on Munich&#39;s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
&quot;This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have a chance.&quot;
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut&#39;s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
&quot;It is too early to let the opportunity slip away, if at the moment the plans are ruined,&quot; said Günter Ploß, the head of the HSB, on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement of the head of the senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sports of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg&#39;s bid for the 2015 Universiade not as &quot;a substitution&quot; for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Just last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as an application candidate.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
&quot;For many years the senate delayed the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,&quot; said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies from the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). .
While the SPD always called for integrated planning of Olympia for little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg&#39;s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the wooden boxes.
Whoever associates the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Today the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that hangs over Warhol&#39;s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four &quot;type&quot; Brillo-Boxes on this list are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol&#39;s 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six &quot;Brillo-Boxes &quot;, which the ex-director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the other &quot;Stockholm type&quot;, which are in circulation in the international art market, turn out to be as well.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot; in New York, he painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had boxes of &quot;Brillo&quot; soap powder.
According to Warhol, hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes were exhibited at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expense), but were brought directly from the &quot;Brillo&quot; cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed some wooden Brillo-boxes to be produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as original &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot; of the &quot;Stockholm type&quot; authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were bought for more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left him were produced and exhibited.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head curator of the Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three privately owned Swedish ones that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight plates were printed and ground and then they were painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the prints from the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight plates. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
&quot;These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes,&quot; says Lars Nittve, the director of Moderna Museet, adding that if the &quot;Andy Warhol Art&quot; Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibits&quot;.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these &quot;serious accusations&quot; in which they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers have been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military policemen who were supposed to watch him had joined their ranks and continued their mutiny.
They entered the &quot;Península&quot; hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
&quot;People are fed up,&quot; Trillanes said.
&quot;We summon the people to join our ranks.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon other military troops wanted to march on.
The great critics of the government called for a large demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel&#39;s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the takeover of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial part of Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
The assumptions about entering the business were already made on Wednesday, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the titles of participation for a third party partner.
United Internet already in the previous day made participate with almost 10 percent to the company of telecommunications Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started with the negotiations on marketing cooperation of the DSL-products.
&quot;We are strengthening our collaboration,&quot; explained the United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded a joint venture, MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with Freenet&#39;s ten percent share and do not make use of their right, that is, they make Freenet&#39;s 18.49 percent share.
That meant that both companies retained all options, most notably the stake in the Freenet limited company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This &quot;game&quot; with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or full contract.
Until now the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch directly held a 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
So they had agreed that Drillisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
