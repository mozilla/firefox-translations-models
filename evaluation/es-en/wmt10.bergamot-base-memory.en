Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of 1.4 million dollars will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have much to do.
First, visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, even if the third one who receives him in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid such an issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kroner).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable paraffins, but has not yet decided which particular organization to do.
During their full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which the Norwegian kings, the prime minister and another 250 guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not fully deserving of it.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature advocate accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the southern villages of Moravia you can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the center into the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské Náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me by Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It goes without saying that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
For vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It is still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extra-league of hockey, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
"Paroubek" budget removed money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s view, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But also not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted the government to subsequently borrow for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. “That’s just putting down the problems for the future, it’s laying mines,” says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
To all to whom the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, his children too.
People don’t have to worry about income or sickness subsidies, they will receive them. 1.800 million disappeared from these accounts.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be only 163,000 million missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s effort, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenditures.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and neither can its price be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year of ČEZ allocated 18,000 million to the budget.
Each year of the dividends ecological damages are settled, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or to litigation expenses, including in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, use the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million left for the Státní pokladna (State Box) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between various operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
At the push of a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be released in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work, at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It’s not just ski lifts in Krkonoše that they’re worried about snowless slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the Spindl.Info Martin Jandura information portal.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindlerův Mlýn offer above all weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year interest in winter stays is harmed by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the clues remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also run out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied also in the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we found approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in Krkonoše stays will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will have the desire for snow waiting.
Temperatures should drop on Thursday and if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But after again temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaiting, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the “as in Iraq” locution used several times, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of the January 2007 Bush declaration for his own statement: “A new way forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war. And that he criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is nothing talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president faltered for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general into 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s entire strategy seems his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years. The entire doctrine of Obama generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain only one people of Potemkin. Behind him will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “able to act,” a minimum goal of the entire operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes over his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to break out.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon" will perform some miracle here.
From the political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of the troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly underwilling to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and they also do not want to explain to their constituents what relationship is the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution like this will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for the presidential election and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Top executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to bring bonuses together on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest road it must undertake, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after having taken almost 17,000 million dollars (almost 300,000 million CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the 20,000 million dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a tax of fifty percent, the bonuses for bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all the categories but Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she was also among the winners of a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (about 25 million Czech kronor).
In the case of several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, the Peace Prize, was received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet, will be the issues of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The quote was reported by the spokesman of President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163,000 million kroner.
The MP, however, on Wednesday approved proposals from the left for fund transfers and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet begin to be controversial, the form of which was agreed in spring by the SDG, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long ignored "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek said the budget is appalling and the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas said for ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, SDGs and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is frightening, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200,000 million kroner.
On Wednesday ČSSD said the state budget approval for next year was successful.
The populars were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, recounts a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some criticisms say that the starring roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama of boxing world Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slavery abolition movement, who ended up being a slave, the fictional U.S. president, and even God in Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his efforts to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong worldwide to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for Mandela’s story to make it to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by squeezing your hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, you said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the splendor over Norway resolved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava"-type missile, formerly destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavah, in most cases, did not fly out or an air failure occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavah" as "a missile that does not fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problem occurred at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulavah.”
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment onwards that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held out and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately broken down in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to affirm that "Bulavah" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL matchup against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club, told the AP.
It is still unclear whether the famous player’s return will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the mood of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous Fetisov players, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Glory Hall of hockey.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the automobile factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all supplementary work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared the emergency on Monday by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, two shifts will be worked, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, prolong on a Christmas day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacture last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Employees at the auto factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and the trade unionists must be held on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they committed to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management said employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
With regard to supplementary work, trade unions require that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 kroner for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
As of last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'calliced' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some accessible drugs already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbones are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the drugs used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work the scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to virus albumin.
Metallocarbones have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press story published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteases was carried out in a specimen, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, make metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "frightening" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDGs were singled out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say you leave time for analysis.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, SDG and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to lean on the minority, that he is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDG and the social democration towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the modification proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they hedged increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
SDGs before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feeling useless; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten the resignation in the event of the approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said, he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment over the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in government they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, who imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, whether he will resign, whether the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: SDG-nominated ministers are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that he rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies."
However, this will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when it is time, I will take care of it, said to the journalists in the chamber of deputies the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDGs.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon left for a European Council meeting in Brussels.
ODS gave way at the request of the prime minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the SDG deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDGs does not care about the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule goes into effect.
Most rates including basic and customer price will not change.
More chances of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendoline career.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line fewer fast trains will circulate, direct links will be restricted Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in drahy-planned transport is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13 travelers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion kroner in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why the prices of a large majority of tickets did not increase.
Changes will occur only on day tickets - ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the unique price of 160 kronor for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino gunmen continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released
The armeds have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only on 65 abductees.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 gunmen use the hostages as a living shield in the run before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to the handover of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed belong to the New People’s Navy (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police previously pursued the kidnappers due to the violence, whose cause was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan, arrested the governor of the massacre.
In the island of Mindanao, the Muslim separatists also operate.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA’s story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of former South African Republic President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the leading role of Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with that of Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
Great hope, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in football culminate in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media is shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new RSA film have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the starring roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - to charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It’s a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to bring together two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup at the time.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as he said in an interview only for LN only by a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled their country to Brittany.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns burns
The fire caught a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of the Ustí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the spokeswoman for the company, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kroner, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mandatová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the ČEZ company for the northern Chequia, the electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It retains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander to three social democratic hetmans.
This is Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martinek from Pardubický kraj and the hetman from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes in Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company’s effort, to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All the regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All the three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pastries of the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Society Student Agency, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned both having the tests of all the regions. According to him, they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, this time too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses liar and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, which would aim to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD MP, due to his criticism of railway transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we didn't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what is the lord about it, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions already appear, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January, children born since August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month of age of a child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 kroner and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand kroner annually.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state spent approximately 500 thousand annually for the entire vaccination of the children.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Of the pneumococal infections in our country every year, 28 children not older than 10 years of age die according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time opinions appear, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has long propagated pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health however does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this time we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, they can be reasoned about the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were afraid, however, that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million American dollars (12 million pounds) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while carrying 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour defends tax increases in budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The finance minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1 % cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow around three billion pounds per year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax Breakdowns for Electric Cars and Wind Turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the supplemental tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax hikes and delineated spending cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow back to the end of the year.
However, the Labour party’s forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75 percent this year, much worse than the 3.5 percent decline forecast in April, while the loan order would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the loan application projection of £789 billion for the next six years was untenable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, added, “cynically” dodging the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," Finance Ministry Minister Philip Hammond said in the shadows. "They had the opportunity to do it and have wasted it."
“All major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandbed.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as rising inflation of some April disability subsidies, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that people are being provided with more need it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish the post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really putting the pain off for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
"All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This was the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI inquires about "American detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
Pakistan’s U.S. embassy told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S., last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also seeking information about the men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and under what kind of circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of them's uncle.
He said the house was already in the crosshairs of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported her disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian ‘abuses’
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential election held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected precedent criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"I often get hit in the face" in his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a fake confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the government’s post-election unrest and response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
He made a ski slope in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was quite frightening.
You see the under a beautiful view of the city lights twinkling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent."
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be left to melt.
Yet they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and a widespread alert about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s latest work “Why the French Don’t Like Headcarves (2006), an elegant and detailedly argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr.'s last book. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about gay evolution and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can’t spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interview tends to disagree with his counterparts in Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “an adjustment of values.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say “Yes, but not yet.”
The world's most bleak picture
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transportation and fishing have focused on recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage in confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of a wild adult’s area. The weather is almost never adequate: a polar bear residing in Singapore turned green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Snow-to-snow Ezym Indians use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northward waters of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a breathtaking look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the cold war submarines mapped the ice laces moving beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resilient cold-camped individuals still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by splashes of saltwater that is compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being shipped, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, that has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than US$150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charles Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the cemetery’s wide meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t get as many visits as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the pairs held hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bow tied on top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, were virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the bleak atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loudly sculpted names on the stones, while others bowed to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose gravestones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped away the tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Sgto Marine Gunner. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember him."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely provoke tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide further information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments by passing terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not flaught and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani law enforcement authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has put as a top priority trying to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking with special attention at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent enormous appeal, due to their potential to have access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years regarding those they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
It has become a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder climate actions.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated the amount to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
In a day in which little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "Earth says "it's enough".
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or the wearing of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but that they were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is great, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He pointed out that it was up to each other’s perspective to define whether the gait was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal math performance gradebook was very good news for Capital District public schools.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students staged at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress figures is the persistent difference in achievement between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white fourth-grade students in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over the course of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference separating fourth-grade black and white students in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been barely reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, D.C.’s chief executive. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, a regular critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of test scores is that city high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries is that we are not devoting the time or energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading resume, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and middle school seniors, who did not master the fundamentals of early reading in their school years and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten through sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, that was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to make a difference.
Here’s a kind of rugged dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
So the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we built a system of excellent schools.
We have to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance gap is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
It’s nearly 200 days to get to have the force of change, said Janey, who struck a deal with her teachers’ union last year in an 185-day year, which she considers an “indicator” to seek a bigger increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong soil.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs US$38,690 a year, her attitude was less of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Boy, really, he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze higher-performing people say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than US$300 million per year to local school systems, to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent frequenting the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on just two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
Poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more forcefully in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, drifted away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered in more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The shortlisted companies to submit proposals made offers that were later confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each deposit.
Al Qaeda’s main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified, CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car got hit, an official from Pakistan’s civilian intelligence agency said, talking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior military planner of al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this likely included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s senior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly ascended the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led non-piloted aircraft strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to a tactic enhanced by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected whistleblowers, the site said.
UN top envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he backs the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timeline for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the readiness of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's allegations, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undermine its ability to attract talent.
Such is the case that the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for his failure to strike talks on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates said some sanctions could also affect the general Iranian population.
He argued that it would take “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer enormously” sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would re-negotiate on restricting his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran’s tightening with the international community over some proposals they actually accepted in early October, has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on Dec. 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options were rethought, including continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and unfounded accusations,” on behalf of some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “in order to get an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to relieve Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began to incentivize young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously stubby children, spoiled only children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division
Demographic of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over counted nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate a future labour shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual pay in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have backed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have done abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incentivize more births.
Almost overnight, the posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unoverwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the more urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu Township in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yeah, we're being robbed of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the HR manager, said he wants an only child because she was, too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents struggle during the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child is time-consuming by the parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best day care when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, captured renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Crafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what the limit of the global temperature rise would be that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred the talks on Friday, promising to provide US$3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week was presented.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are discussing who should pay for spending to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally mandatory treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the talks will produce a political agreement at most.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drew up a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "putted political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
Senior officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, descended from the planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so that they could delimit the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present nightly shows mocking the countries that they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global Conservation Policy International.
Heavyweights are coming.
The first train 225 km/h from Britain redefines that sentiment on Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, as it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity service Javelin outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would shorten and the shift of planes and cars to the railroad would reduce domestic coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this view.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times said.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Penines to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeastward to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It seems that this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built into sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave the fast lines in the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a £75,000 oranger from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built at his constituency home.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “rations,” increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the supplementary interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the members’ expenses. Last night the Mr. Duncan said the requests “couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby homes have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange."
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. was not asked. Duncan who made no reference to the loan increase, during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee investigation into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271,406-pound mortgage on his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The mortgage interest rate of Mr. Royal Bank of Scotland. Duncan did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the 75,000-pound loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan was still applying for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as speaker of the House opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive “rations” after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like m**rda.”
He said, “I spend my money in my garden and apply for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could apply for a lot more, but I don't. "
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had applied for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan in protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for paramount improvements, approved by both the wage office and later by Legg.”
He added: “It’s not about evading and delinquiring or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, by the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton Beach Palapa
Brighton’s palapas have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their subject.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed pastries and free served punch.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we expect us as a Church to have people come to an old strange building? I believe that the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in call for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on climate change will have to reach by Friday. It would come into effect on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the fact that "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen is very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with cobblessons and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the “Black Blocks”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue for negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from large European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial raincoats responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to seek compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are dry rivers, waterways that you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act forcefully against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17 h GMT.
According to those responsible for the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergueï Bagapch categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of vote scrutiny.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory from 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following their separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a nice white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch next to the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different parts of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, to the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as the one that gives Russia control of the bank railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a runoff will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to call for an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the midst of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 the delegates of 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police surrounded them quickly and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy home during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We didn’t take their eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial raincoats responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to seek compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to head the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed dresses in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Council of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations were formed from hundreds of protesters calling for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Informativo on Sunday (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all the students of the first high school student will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "it is enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches General and Literary Teaching cannot be subrams of the C, he goes on to emphasize even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography in second of high school in the technological schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy of the second-grade C program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will perform an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and by the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as trainees.
If you do all the practical proposals prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Escuela Normal Superior, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the conference conference "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey their desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, told AFP, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed hoping that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record."
Videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website beginning December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, action is planned
Prison guards unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The prison workers’ force (2nd union of guards) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT prison (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", because it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "summons general mobilization ... in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards’ unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the personnel for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at making this situation generated by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime hours not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary requirements", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional union FO of Marseilles indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threat FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
The moment we increase our tasks and missions without taking more strength, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT prison of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, not in all regions the same thing happens, since some are luckier than others.
But either way, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, told the famous TV host, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be from the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the program's excerpts broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously answering pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he is in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries stemming from the operation" of herniated discs carried out in Paris on November 26, his press service said in the same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about their status, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information conveyed by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection stemming from Delajoux’s intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said that he was not "any problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to take twelve hours of a plane after such an operation, it is not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he spoke with Laeticia, the musician’s wife, who had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer’s health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had surgery for a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is over-told. Fans and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on the scene.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in your favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cups in a long pool, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were last allowed, only three world records were surpassed when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a mark he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two distances queens of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet overtook Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that starting on January 1st will be banned.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself in the background in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
The U.S.: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold at USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold Thursday at 1.5 million dollars, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of ancient Rome and Egypt art auctions at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It sold out among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the French Third Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied him the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Migration Directorate.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renounce" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as the guest acting Head of State.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position ..., they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, a refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a safe-conduct application, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask any country for asylum, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around Brazil’s embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president, Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until he ended his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to US$32.9 billion.
Analysts hoped, on the contrary, for a deepening deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the course of the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.492% to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban supporters booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro while walking towards the center of the capital demanding the release of such detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" chanted the militants of power at the dissidents with their fists.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday on international human rights day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist said.
The agents forcibly boarded the vehicles to dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call opponents of “mercenaries” or “agents” paid by their declared enemy, the United States.
Rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Seine Heights) on Thursday at the height of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant, would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, to an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
In the wake of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty, stood in the way and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the wounded other, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was admitted "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped down Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently randomly, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and another forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that he was carrying crossed on his back, an Alliance union official in the Seine Highs, Arnaud Pressé, said on the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienate, according to the testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. Putting him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 35 years arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention, he said no word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalizing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all such deranged whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer asks again to dismiss the case
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski claimed again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "El Pianista," denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the incident before three judges of the Second District of California Appeals in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since) had spoken with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before passing sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument set forth in the first instance, that is, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously evaluated as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, the United States has never been on again.
Los Angeles District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?” asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor to the court, although he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one calling for dismissing the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also once again called for closing the case.
She argues that her client no longer bears her to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, enough is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technology component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly shrinking and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend remained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion on the strength of the economic revival," Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November for the second straight month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were slowed by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "takes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% to 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% to 4.492% the day before.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are in the final stretch to fulfill her dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences! said astonished Miss Sierra Leone.
This contest that for the ninth time is held in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 h (15 h GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the southern summer heat.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of discovering again "African landscapes that take their breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World are concentrated in the contest.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa proved capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something uncommon for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
He will probably return for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 h local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, distended, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection stemming from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone an induced coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection, the aftermath of a herniated disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated on once again on Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the private international clinic of the Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated on twice as a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the broadcaster RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "left without cannula, with nothing", after his Parisian operation.
The Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also intervened to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a cerebral hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regually" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being advisable."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, returning to the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former giscardist party, intimating him to remove it from all support, or pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy intiming them to resign the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under penalty of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the movement’s name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l’UDF d’aujourd’hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove “immediately the mention of the UDF’s name from all support, as well as from (its) website.”
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) trademark to the legitimate rightholders."
If not, justice will be appealed to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Take advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC’s strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make their own name than to try to leave anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to.”
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will stand trial for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as claimed by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors appointed Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered weak statuses and for what periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after leaving the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the provenance of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations sometimes resulted in a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that he was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I could never talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to make room for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Finally, the court decided that the trial on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would be pronounced once the trial was made.
Management or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that collaborators adhere to "values" determined from above as before it was to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to the preference factors of the customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees may end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the Business Intelligence (BI) "demands that all parties involved ... have proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that is entirely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls have relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, prompt the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionately to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient behavioral theory that American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executives' commitment, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanistic management position, misfit from the world today.
Identifying and measuring mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Address: "Just War" Obama Receives Right-Wing Acclaim
On Friday, the U.S. right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award ceremony to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential address, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure on the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, he dedicated himself, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives was glad, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in presidential words.
At times, I found the speech very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a possible Republican inauguration candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as "he always does", he "spoke like an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not-very convinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president’s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" mostly for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, judging it "at the same time as a bleak and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached on Friday afternoon an agreement that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transportation Secretary Dominique Bussereau "joined" for the agreement, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye to the premise on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text agreement late in the morning.
Although three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew, they slammed into a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text signed at 18 h.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low salaries.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissatisfied rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) stated, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement."
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in the employer's charges" was the subject of a government amendment in the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it “under the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies attached to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "business of naive", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and the leadership of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 20 p.m., at the rate of one train of every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of every four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers each day, were glad that “RATP strives to provide service to large stores.”
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circulated at peak times, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Ile of France.
In this way, at the time, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old Jack Nbakina explained that he had woken up "an hour and a half earlier to reach schedule."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A that operates the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or to it arrived or left from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want who claim a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its proposals of premium in parentheses, said the CGT indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is planned on Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indépendants filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party leaders, among which are its president Ahmet Türk and the deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision comes in the wake of a proceeding launched by Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict intervenes at the moment when the government reaches out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolius, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or slings.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk said the justice decision would "deepen the discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
At first, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This is not how anything is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was staged an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of winter road maintenance of the FES
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Weather forecasters may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-strates with large salt vehicles come out, Brauburger explains.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES begins around three in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic of the rush hours begins."
The difficult thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space to vehicles with salt."
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the inconvenience is generated, you know Brauburger.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is launched, dangerous points and cruises are mainly cleared.
Usually the FES could not take care of all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight of mainly the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salt vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa found looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found in a day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered the remains of five specimens in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupeda sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Herbivorous Ornithishia (the herbivorous ornithishia)and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa can is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in the skull of Tawa found the researchers found indications of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of the theropods, birds.
Thanks to air pockets, the respiration of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the theropod with older and more primitive airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs hitherto known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurias first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America through all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa find the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
All three cannot descend from a unique related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils continue to be preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct at the boundary of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
The success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slows the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino from Goethe University in Frankfurt had an impact worldwide.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement drafted in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evacuated last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando."
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of investigation and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served for "delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and diverted attention from content.
The board has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legistimized Protest
Also the young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen’s Science Minister, however, defended the performance of the university’s rector and the police.
We are grateful to the university rector.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Province Parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext in order to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Close Collaboration Protocol".
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed Planning Chief Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the wooded mountain landscape, in which research facilities were established.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law is. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate into the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos from irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at that time engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since in the past a huge amount of time was needed to hook the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that is why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which is approximately halfway along the path of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 80’s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm will be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are carried by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
It creates new urban space, equipped with many green areas, probably of the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980’s.
At that time there was no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be addressed in strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crosses and narrow passages on the network.
In total sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the layout has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves the Wiesbaden regional parliament pending, if it is to file an appeal in the ruling on the nightly flight ban of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the north-west airstrip planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would not be concilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population of noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, if it will file the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to resign from appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of a ban on night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be trying through terminations of the right and tricks still to get its overnight flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally unblemished decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group’s claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned in one go of the aid provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30,000 million euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by the U.S. CNBC.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had made approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis especially thanked American taxpayers Wednesday night: financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had miscalculated the effort of the investment bank to absorb the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from source of known circles, that the U.S. bank could announce already by Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June they had already returned their aids Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick choice
In the end everything was faster than previously thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF’s board of directors (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s Berlin senior studio.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced the failure to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's impeachment was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the board of administrative councils had already indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the ZDF news outlets would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which he scourged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had meddled in the debate, who described Koch’s action as unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
He then worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" news.
Next stations: 1988 until 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the impeachment of Brender, which was still elected Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch’s opponent in the board of directors, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of pro-ZDF control guilds’ supporters was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the board of directors with a smart move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's removal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a party henchman.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
College careers are clearing
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the states finally gave up. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to get through their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each career module must end with a single exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and we want to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder is committed to more flexibly making the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master’s careers.
Regulations of the Länder that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities continually talk about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully conclude a career (studability).
Now for the first time, there has been talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to dramatically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of college careers.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition in the future, "studability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative."
These rules would be valid for new careers, but also in the examination of existing races.
These must be "re-accredited" every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the states.
Education and culture ministers urged the states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhine-Platinate said it had provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement mentoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and overseas offices.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition we want to guarantee the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the races about their "studentability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
On the board of directors at the federal level of the Juso (young socialist) university groups it was demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as principals involved should now be able to have an opinion as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a later Master’s degree.
In addition, the states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient places of study for Master with the best possible conditions of study. This was reported by a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically unchecked" says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in unbalancing idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum at Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave that talking a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had started slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial dominance, the literary scene is shaken and especially the community of German authors from Romania for a case that evidences the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, from what is known so far, not only is he an author, but also a victim.
In his file of Securitate IM Walter he had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused him or defended him at all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this claim," he said.
Söllner’s statement in this way and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, it is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable spy shelter for the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read its own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and have known in some cases, what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is given rather to drags.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Temesvar Securitate spoke contemptuously of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there are quiet blame.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Söllner lets it be hoped that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much for the adjudication of guilt and for shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than just a footnote.
Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team’s supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed outdoor service was leaving a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the characteristic bald had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start the work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the round of 16", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we can not be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the “real classes” in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The Champions League round of 16 (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/lap matches 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminating entrance of Babbel’s successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had briefly inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for the success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer taken effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel’s supporter, Jens Lehmann, “when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived “phenomenon” with the proverbial “fresh wind” and the way of working of the new boss: “He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had obviously been missing when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally exceeded by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 sad awakening had arrived, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached the board for a weakness in the direction, which had decided to change coaching because of pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, he called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt replied, announcing consequences for the defender.
They probably won't be friends forever anymore, the two forty.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the substituted coach team, the spectacle of great play and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important involvement in success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Fight of the World Heavyweight Championship
Fiery duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old in the WBC version beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko he was his third successful title defender since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
Before some 17000 spectators in the Arena de Berna, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again of the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right-handed goal to his goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely caught up with the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who held twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as “horrible zombie,” that he “can’t do anything.”
In the weigh-in, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company promoting him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal opposition attack: The head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar, due to false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for having thoroughly deceived the cause.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens' group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately speak before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional assassination is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and if the chancellery, the military and the information service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence over concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons for the firing of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense for the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has received no response, it was said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the reproaches that are made to it, and said that this would be clarified in the commission of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a state of vigil, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality vanish.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
The fault has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality blur.
Onirically modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations, can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazed thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red grimaces like blood, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him in heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Raucous and evil voices resonate from the walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook on the ceiling.
It climbs in a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope is released.
What's a lesson to you, the voices shout in a choir that blows up the eardrums, "go to the clinic and make them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also maniac-depressive, taking medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inner world, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is not important, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, to wake up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that are perceived in psychosis remain in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still a question why our brain makes cabrioles.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose touch with reality provisionally.
Not everyone develops a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitter system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has collected reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die Ireale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and head trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly self-conscious; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. He was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to a high school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair addresses the word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a dreamy a little strange, but Sarah K. He knows he's not dreaming.
He's awake and he sees and hears that boy, just as he sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audibly way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which is often late and scarce, he does not know how to distinguish if he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. He's today20.
She approved selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
Hallucinations have disappeared for a year.
Since she's come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will start having hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only child, was in a small fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he was used to reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, that's why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limited situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also entails something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and who subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Onyrical conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of one’s own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dreamlike experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a life-saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was bedridden, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek man on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and found a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds the Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each state of consciousness modification, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next thing you question is whether you will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot put his children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from January of the chairmanship of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of the Burda management since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the company’s heritage. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took over direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the publisher.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "shunt the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who are infected by the desire to search for capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of greatness," Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with the “Time” in the world league; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything that - in terms of beauty and well-being - you may desire, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual ‘coaches’ that are guiding the steps of the clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 at night.
Varied necklines
Christmas is coming and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these would be energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closing some of our main production plants," said the president of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both for the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motorsport fans.
This initiative will take place on 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic motor that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Classics Garage, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill Tests on the Outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit enabled outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
Therefore, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -named i-Stop-, a device that at least at the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved throughout its whole.
Finishes, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument frame and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and joyful controls and colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one that also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horse gasoline engine and six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its low rumors, for the benefits and for achieving content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort and for its consumption contained.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, which incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
The standard equipment especially stands out the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates blind spot, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, if that were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not carry out many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
'Premiere' luxury
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in such elegant models as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, with no possibility even to see certain types of attachments or navigate the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifelong data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as his American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up the data when you cross the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and would have to be up and running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated ear pulls to achieve affordable roaming rates for the whole of Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an apparatus like FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and is paid for it when buying it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime access like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope it because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite shade of the American first lady.
If he has already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the one collected in Oslo from the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -green yellow with bright reflections-, the two times the outfit was composed of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vesturious.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with a print.
The accessories have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected this time, mane releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and work trajectory of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have been limited in employment opportunities due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of the coexistence in a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start the coexistence as a couple before, advance the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting the coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time than their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work carried out exerts a lot of influence on motherhood although less on the schedule of pairing, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they are married and the age at which they have the first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"Another division is also established among women based on their level of education.
While those with elementary schools get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle levels or higher reverse this sequence and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a pre-marriage condition and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal slogan of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Poker
Manuel Vincent gives away in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also for the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical semblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vincent does not save scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same that I felt without giving it its name: the pleasure against the unsolved destiny, the morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers fall again and again.
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others who was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry thrown from a bridge by that character from Munich to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life hard pleasure death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted in all normality that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of such a patient man in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went ahead of his madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to go through Baroja over Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the fame of that man to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of a mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we did not find the fun in a free aggression to a small and helpless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this we must add the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and that, when he rebuked these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energumen that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five in the afternoon of a Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a close police station that we doubted will serve much and not generate susceptibilities, only clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse for free a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the case of suffering an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informational nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheeled vehicle tires, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Upload the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of vendors Ganvam.
The good fact, however, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound in the last month, the cumulative registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailor’s drawer of light commercials: derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions that the closed tap of bank loans entails, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Given this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, Ganvam again recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sellers’ association forecasts a similar 2010 to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the anti-lock of ABS brakes and will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of lack is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the stomp that the driver gives.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take advantage of the full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses in stopping.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with human damage would be avoided – when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until early 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on Saab’s sale should be made in the coming days.
This is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained by the end of the year if it is not sold.
Behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their last, and expensive jewel, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to make it thin by no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas with manual actuation, which saved 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fell' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the light wheels of 19 inches.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK change, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual case, mainly on California’s secondary roads, on mountain stretches with actually reversed paths
Their behavior can only be described as blameless.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: we had not tested such a small and light model for a while that, at the same time, transmitted so much safety in the cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short gait for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and re-squeeze his engine...
What we ask. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very much achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the bellowing of the engine, already previously released in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance all the way; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the parades of the 'maison', the singer lavishes her face of malata with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s a ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and in this way it is in the lead of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples scored was the best of its team (29 of valuation).
The Vitorian team was able to replace the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although he had to suffer until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 three-pointers scored had a lot to do with the final victory.
The match began in the face of the Barça, who got from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians went from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot wrists..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alaves team opted for the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause in the return to the one who was his home, to continue extending his advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'fewest six' rating of Splitter already made it foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being on the road at half-time, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that anyone does not win on their court, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pushing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More Inconvenience
Those of Ivanovic, injured but not much less dead, needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to fouls, those of Ivanovic did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had owner and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first in the season.
Injuries prevent fighting Unicaja
The Unicaja lost raughtly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave it the lead of group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the casualties of the boxers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither for the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-pointers, two from baseman Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, fighting goal, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing their superiority within both areas, where the injury leave of the English center Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing down the boxers.
Between the indoor players and the Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive to Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even even even equalized the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group to be wobbled.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the game.
Despite all the inconveniences of the Unicaja for the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos when it squeezed and given its superiority in centimeters inside the area was unstoppable.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic managed to come back the average basketball 81-62, 37th minute, and the Unicaja went out, delivering the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified real estate, employment and engine ads in Spain.
The How much to collect tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140. 000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, based on a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels low pay," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data that Trovit has its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya departure
The Brazilian government has put a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when he would officially complete his term.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's status as a political asylum seeker that the "de facto" government that Roberto Micheletti chairs.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity open bar at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its year-on-year auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, though they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard who were again trying to create a position of conscience on those responsible for global economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle among the Emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments earlier this year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt spreads expand just as European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European spreads decline and ours continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not predict much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it has all the look that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driving friend".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to increase.
Its commitment is focused on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms of capture of carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, of course, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to fight climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "on-time" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must be started already as they take long to mature and a stable remunerative framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Switzerland’s Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, lasts five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction company and highway concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready at the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to get the work and exploit the toll.
Waiting for their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums compete with a remarkable presence of European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liz, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium plays, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screen is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if not by way of acquiring a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has an outstanding presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and called Northern Link, is called to link the western Toowong Highway with the ring road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce congestion in traffic in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this step of payment would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be finished until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euro) to its funding.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The one owned by ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
Moreover, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-story King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm obtains this contract days after taking over the expansion of the Bosruck (Austria) tunnel for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on it will be Mrs. Rushmore the design and production manager of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for stopping competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the old French monopoly and still state-owned company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and that it is therefore a repeat offender.
Application Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn’t just provide glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have gone well in this cast.
The white club has been the third in the continent to pocket the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body that Michel Platini chairs plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400.000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But it is also that there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four places assigned.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday described the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public takeover offer (opa) for all the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest in said deferment of 1% per year
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the judicial ups and downs of their former executives, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
It is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will unveil new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the opa of exclusion of Paternina that presented Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opt-out offered by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with the current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the modifications introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of current regulations.
New tools to harvest cars
In these days of storms and accidents, they don’t just win car shops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are towed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No loss is the same, and the calculation of part costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the most recent computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for claims and maintenance assessment are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of pricing and information-making tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed does not stop increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, each model makes a "smart" graphic image where you can "click" different parts of tourism.
If it is a massive sales model, the work may be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in the preparation of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but in which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard claim valuation solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to usage, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is concentrated on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know deviations by brands or models.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop because of breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa group company founded in 1971 as a provider of damage, breakdown or maintenance assessment services and solutions
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it was established in Spain.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Reportx ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth one billion dollars on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles damaged.
The operation involved an outlay of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrappers and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been discharged cannot recirculate, but certain undamaged parts can be used as a spare part.
Cars with historical value can register even if they have been discharged after some fary efforts.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the replacement, create budget and generate budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is necessary for use.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears, and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that workshop-oriented does not include estimated labor times.
