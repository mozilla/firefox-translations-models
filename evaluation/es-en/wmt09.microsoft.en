The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day.
After the rapid fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
ČEZ stock transactions reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday's drop when it fell to about 6%.
This time's decline is due to falling stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Falling stocks in Asia
Asian stock stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day marked nearly four percent, though it later pared its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index tracking Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, with Shanghai markets closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the secretary of the Index fell to 3.6 percent.
"The bailout actions scheduled in the U.S. are uncertain and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong Currency Bureau Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner) should be dedicated.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent. A similar drop in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the administration, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact on broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers pushed a rift in talks about passing the bailout plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) in the amount of $700 billion.
However, it is not yet won.
Members of Congress must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday at the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Financial Services and Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be reached thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We settled our dissenting views regarding the shape of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government's fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that drive financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is expressly affecting the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively approve a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business before the Asian finance market since these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure when the two houses of the American Congress will vote and, even, if they will not stall at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it gets the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush Appreciated the Progress of the Meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved, which was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the shielded contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the liability of the program's money for taxpayer tax protection of their losses, a relieving shutdown of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of companies participating in the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very it, and we've made great strides toward the deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also aims to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree on the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burdens on debtors' installment payments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, all that relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at this time, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they form 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Heavy and special losses have suffered the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously faltering.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the rough results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse is the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that as early as Monday it could be reached at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such a development would obviously pave the way for the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, that is, the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the social democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing of 1999 would be repeated when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit,  but in 2005 it was dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
Haider is clearly committed to this evolution, who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach the parliament although it has lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Armed fighting: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player manages to make calls.
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone.
Even so, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music crowd your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of turntable.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - MP3 music.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decide battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as telephoning, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse photography device and you can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and PDAs they will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the screen indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy swallows.
Few are the mobiles that manage to play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they constantly call each other, for added safety, a charger for work - this is also true for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a fraction of the devices have the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some reading units without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
Simply fill the device with music via the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order in the music library according to the name of the artist, album title, genre or also according to the user's rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its operation.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you are going to listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays is enough.
What practically any mobile truly achieves.
You should not even be interested in the format in which your phone or player plays music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and, practically, almost all the music that comes will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could be by itself a strong argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the topics of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree ones.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has practically every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even as far as the technical part is concerned, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing other than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data download.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, use the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the aforementioned brand plus arria brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will already arrive, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long in coming.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written in mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming charges will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), has already said that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in prices to which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is a place for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
For the rest, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they only need to have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often counteracted by the offer of more adjusted services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, the bet on a non-trivial target group can also be a good blow.
This operator specifically targets man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking – he's the operator he likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as Poland could hook our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the service offer, it is relatively saturated"
No chances in Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Quite the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in it, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then, maybe better times are flashing.
It seems that, due to unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is referred to by other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional agreement with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
He adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon "
Vodafone directs its attention rather to compliance with the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it precisely as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a fall in prices and with it, a decrease in profits.
So why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the ČTÚ websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the utter disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure was concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
Until today no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential interested parties was rather not interesting enough for the classic operators, "added Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Affairs of the ÚOHS.
These statements come as no surprise to the operators' representatives.
For offices that are supposed to represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, but they must also see to it that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the lowering of prices are not in the interest of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a fluke offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding promotion of responsibility in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many sticking points.
Obviously, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for ÚOHS the fact that three mobile operators ascend strikingly in a similar way should represent a warning.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators there are many similar impediments.
Placing the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the ÚOHS washes its hands of this whole matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently tabled to extend the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenders which was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of ÚOHS should know this perfectly well, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything goes well, when no one is watching
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator continues to operate unnoticeably and there are already a few in Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile telephony services, which, however, only a part are public.
Normally these are companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases like those cited were discovered, we could speak of a violation of the conditions of the contract that could result in the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová responded to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators did not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a not inconsiderable profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name so they can not have it absolutely as a normal customer of the operators. "
This is precisely what should seem to the ČTÚ at all strange.
In addition, a new question appears for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators squint in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want to, it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we will stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, one market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at the moment the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but their customers.
Either with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really arrives in these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators allows a virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and one with female voice, another with choir and one instrumental.
The singing is done by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
All four versions can iHNed.cz heard on the server.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has said before that it intentionally chose for solos singers with young representative voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both of us and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home was first played in 1834 on the stage of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the rise of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company is written the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased right now by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual passes (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the infocenters and kiosks of the transport company in the Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy,  Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The vouchers can be purchased since yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket booths in the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window available to passengers with trained personnel who help those interested with online shopping and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher on the Opencard at the automatic vending machines located in some subway halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, reminiscent of a banknote chopping machine and travelers will probably have noticed them by now at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start operating tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only to it.
Electronic vouchers from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are inspectors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Ring buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver's ticket office.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but it is also necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place destined for it on the side of the Cashier.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher ends can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The Sudetenland Germans requested in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire some groups of Sudeten Germans presumably addressed the U.S. president in 1945.
It results from letters kept in a private archive and now kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter wrote, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the German South-East presumably supposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume Šumava forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way contributes to the victory of the Allies," the letter wrote.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the German world, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the U.S. lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a bit childish, according to some specialists it aptly paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have sensed minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enrolled in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media could be characterized.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The $150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them to tie their belts before they get going.
It wants to reach the awareness above all of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and finally also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that attack emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bloodthirsty" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "You don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This should symbolize that man in a moment of confusion can pay with his own life.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
He promises that in this way he will reduce accidents and the death toll on Czech roads.
The ads have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he runs a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is threat of fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks," says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why an information campaign in the press is necessary and mainly negative publicity, specifies the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is a panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace.
The president of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out about the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"For sure we will keep a certain percentage of these lands, but to the Palestinians we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or bulldozers to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he later insisted.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to part with to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (movement), they must get rid of the permanent support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas (movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "said the prime minister.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not solved then yes, then yes it would surely lead to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized by Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal affairs.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Their problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then he can request the exoneration of the case and wait in freedom for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted person "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already being obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that too," Schwarzenberg said.
Moreover, as the ČTK said, he insisted to his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists to be of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and convict these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister avoided the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side a promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova we have the question of whether stewardesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is contrary to the road traffic law," says transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the precise moment when the steward distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing seats, company director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat, "he told us his position.
The stewardess does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka less bluntly.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Traffic at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have places on foot.
That's it," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban ones, where there are places to stand and of limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand with a greater speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert in transport safety, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see major problems regarding the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here you are not sure that the turbulence will come and that the flight attendant can hit her head."
"However, if the bus brakes suddenly obviously the physical laws are valid.
The same as in a city bus or tram.
The safety of the hostess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier, "he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the hostess service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, even after the accident, does not consider that work risky.
"However, the moment I have the impression that the position of stewardess is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can meet you, passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks hostesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have flight attendants, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident on the line to Naples, a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably veered from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus. without using the turn signals.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he collided with the front right side.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the hostess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also from the guilty party.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision about the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They are not too much dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewardesses something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," spokesman Hanzelka concluded, that the control of security on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
A Czech referee a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it depicts Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Marine Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this mood and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides until today a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms until today that in themselves hold the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with coastlines have begun today to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental edge.
"Simply, by continental edge is meant the part of the seafloor and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the underwater continent.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often as far as the border of two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Rim of the continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a commission of technical and legal specialist assistance.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone ahead," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, so did New Zealand – the seabed area granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain that will come from the use of the seabed will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Wherever the continental edge ends, the region of the ocean floor begins, declared by treaty as a "common heritage of mankind".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," says director Mikulka emphatically, adding "that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the authority to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
The hope of Düsseldorf rests on Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of West LB bank to its collaborators there is no lack of great words.
The merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank can form 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as stated in the letter, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'bloco of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers at the level of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also from the federal financial services monitoring institute which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been a lot of talk about the merger of this kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse's clients know from their investment funds, and West LB.
Truth be told, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August let it be known that he sees no point in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But DEKA's board of directors, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, tasked the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation within the scope of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important businessmen on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba's involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks was always played with again.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
For when the Bavarian parliament elections are to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to keep merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank may just be a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with West LB.
In any case, only Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only part of it.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far did not give any answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can reconcile the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger bear that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds it knows how to produce in its throat.
First Elena pats Luca, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, 'direction Munich, the beer festival', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored sideburns, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and guidance in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night buses are already on the road on the motorway with the direction "Brenner"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay like that, they will still need the strength.
It stops for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates take another break on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 in the morning in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First: put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic script is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means marching!" shouts Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back places in the tent.
"Do not take the places in front, because we are going to block, and everyone with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, scattered throughout space!"
A liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he goes out of place, he will already be occupied!"
Third: "This evening at exactly half past ten you have to get here!" Have you understood?
And now everyone is going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties yellow caps on trees, road signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; It is about 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italians is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed only last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that has happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes as well as from private banks from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a brief period – which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net gains from financial operations fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities and those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses trended down by more than 70 percent.  in 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high income from the reimbursements of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the ex-Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could show a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier at first got lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As not much money could be made from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now Hypo Real Estate has to make write-downs on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It is a fact that they have cancelled dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became an important state financier and financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not hold client deposits, he, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of Defa's credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function."
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that financing should not be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
Word spread that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least worried people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts remain almost unchanged, borrowing rates according to position in the land register are clearly downwards.
The borrowings of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are mainly affected, and rightly so are the borrowings whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it is possible to start from the amortization of pensions within the deadline.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-reports about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, racking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to it and use the transportation on account new losses for upcoming payouts of benefits on the exchange rate in the future.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was at the scene of action.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the action of salvation.
Therefore at the place of liberation were specialists from the German army as well as officials from GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office and experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on the ground.
"Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
On September 19 in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile the saved people arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return by Airbus of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to perform at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word for Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Even before going to school I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find the way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of classes is not fixed as rigorously as at home in Lower Saxony.
At eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty a small meeting with the teachers begins, the 'home room'.
Before class started, I had introduced myself.
Besides, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the audience, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I wore an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this I went to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because two years ago I had started studying this language.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and beckoned and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, cute."
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Later at recess everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German pieces of bread.
It had herbed rice, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit, and something like tofu beef.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, benthos are not simply a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during recess.
That's what I read about in my manga-comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me. "
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
U.S. House of Representatives Does Not Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let a major $700 billion salvation package for financial markets fail with scant measure.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government's package to save the financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he fell short of a majority for the program that should limit disorder in financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to hold a vote although the plan is not as popular.
"It's hard to get political approval to avoid something that absolutely hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state salvation package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts are counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To let the program go into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is there also fear?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control whether they, behaving in the manner similar to us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we engage in other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it plays dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Naturally I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to suppose that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with language, this often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it may, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, then its research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
One could investigate the processes of consciousness of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential passes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind we are in when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, so does Jaak Pankseep, but he concentrates more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving similarly feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That's true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured of rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is much to do."
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to carry out work with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take its eyes off us."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in relegation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel of Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by market research institute GfK, bookings for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected is travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Above all, organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are increasing, in this case travel costs are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, fell.
Counterattack by Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life – and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The overdue war of the two roses in the ex-couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of the private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as a cheating husband was clear: This is "unheard of for Meg to tell the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News.
Among other things it is very "unfortunate" that Jack, her 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and changes, all that a divorce means for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after a divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become a father of twins.
And so he ends with his statements emphasizing: "Whatever it is, my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine."
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008 airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and overnight stays in hotels became cheap again - these are the results of a study by the provider of travel services and financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a large change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe's 48 different cities increased on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices already fell to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakening dollar course, which was the cause of "American tourists' interest in traveling diminished."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to rising kerosene prices, Economy Class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, airline ticket prices in Economy Class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is partly the increase in the sluggish economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and the United States. USA and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay still doesn't go out to score the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the crash landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, could be clearly read from his lips.
He only knew that he was right.
"We need a second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger at the entrance to the Hamburg stadium's booth.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physical therapist at HSV, enjoying a reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Not everything was pleasant to watch today," Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his header; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said, summing up.
This Monday the SV Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
He expects the partial ratings of the table to correspond more to the vagusness of the league than to the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late obligatory players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, striker Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol demands.
My first Oktoberfest
Party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, beer in one-litre jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a bespoke traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark colored hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially since I am first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to serve their purpose.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather trousers; No one seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my apron that I had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side she is engaged, behind she is a widow."
Or God, now I buckle up from behind to the left.
"Okay," he laughs.
The others don't care many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps with "To drink to get dressed!" written and show, without asking, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after having put next to his glass of a liter of beer that he had just drunk.
He put it directly next to the fire hydrant, most think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and can't consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock at night the groups of toilets run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in groups - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered platforms from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from the degrees of alcohol and is in the walks.
"They are the ones who 'can't take it anymore'," a health worker answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
After the vote defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks' salvation package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At about 20:30 one of the most important barometers of the stock market in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Right now the biggest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares were down nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The salvation plan envisages making resources available to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid at once if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during the development of the course can be collected to reduce the financial burden of the state coffers.
Courses on actions in Europe and the USA U.S. Prices Continue to Decline
The aid of one billion for banks in Europe and in the US The U.S. economy is not reassuring investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) into a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions of the part of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Around the world, financial markets crashed.
The opening of the day of Wall Street in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the U.S. government's $700 billion salvation package won't be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the open, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's main Nikkei index after profit fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent to close at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed for 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused puzzlement to researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuvering.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel lines are freezing now, he is threatened with a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as did the Sun probe Ulysses.
But what surprised researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have greater or lesser speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton now solemnly believes as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers were left in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy's foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions in ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE narrates about the most important cases.
Apparently, the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free.
On this the same information is presented by Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
"We are now monitoring his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are in safety, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shootout before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six hijackers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; The money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of his safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in detention until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to take a position on this report.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was implicated in the crash that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the crash, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather abuse 'led to suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in jail after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiry, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
During the girl's time in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, that having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now looked "emotionally dead," as if she had "given up on life."
In April 2007 her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Ms. Rande is alleged to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and shave her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been an appalling experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, is that if she hadn't, the issue probably wouldn't have ended up in court."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on their daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged by data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to police.
This is surely the least serious charge under the law and does not provide any indication of intent to commit a crime.
The BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Judicial Service said the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the bailout/rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank.
The government provided £14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the interim is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... be called upon today to pay the price for institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that the mediation societies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover £81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant price," added Mr Cole.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest due, which may be almost twice as much.
Since mutual construction societies are organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers had a desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps inland Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to pierce the end of the platforms and has in front two towers, one for each corner, resembling to all a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in their complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vault box office was overcome, there is no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation consortium.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had ambitions to dominate the Middle East via this cured railway to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station was decaying and remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP's leaders, an expert on foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
which has raised some suspicion in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power pastry shops" where middle-class managers in business suits – men and women – meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today it has to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
It has to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to affront that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken up to that point had recited to me almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit to Europe and the United States as well as to Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would largely be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt about which continent this fascinating country should claim.
The price of milk rises from five pence per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It's the second price increase this year, following a two-dollar increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying she can be taken to jail when she returns home.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was prime minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations under his charge.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to take place in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail petition on the grounds that he could not obtain bail because he was already undergoing treatment abroad on parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are going to appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for Afghanistan's polio campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have targeted or hindered thousands of staff members while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competition Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antitrust Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package in ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of US lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their posts by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the lawyers had not evaluated themselves worse than their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the dismissals would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure over the firings, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials followed suit.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the firings, that he "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably uncollaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush aide, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year's awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell spent about nine years in the charts and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serviced.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Seconda Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than an active thoroughfare.
There are no signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the shops and boutiques expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime residents who said they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month's meeting of the Vencidad Community Committee for Land Use, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain in town, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community No. 3, said.
"The city now owns very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms. Brown.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a café, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting.
but Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is the development of the property rather than the management of that.
Compared to its more colourful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a slit of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk on the city's history of Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow and cul-de-sac, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and shutters, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat healed across the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now housed in a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested it could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively appealing to Hispanic voters is a tough business.
Barack Obama's education proposals are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English-language learners.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overturning the gap in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from families with low income:
more than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been tested positively on the 2008 math test.
and nearly an equally staggering 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than what Mr. Obama favored.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, the constant evaluation of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of Sixth Street, the school's focus for English instruction to students is on "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the contents of instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have come from Mexico and who, if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for replication by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his very constant support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than disparage or trivialize them.
Oil price falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday on concerns that the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares declined 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price is down more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rattled by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before retreating once again on huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls because of the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: Team sets record
Having spent more time than anyone else in a Jets uniform playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a deflate game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the middle.
"I didn't go out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a one-man devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were playing at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith took aim for another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave it a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets never scored in a quarter.
Asked to describe the madness of this moment, the team's coach, Eric Mangini, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie tops his world record
Once again, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the comfortable flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, using on average a cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since when track runners like Gebrselassie and Kenya's Paul Tergat have converted to long distances, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes over the past decade, as Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has come under some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of over-orchestrating his careers, generally avoiding encountering many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a racer.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers subsided.
But shortly before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie picked up one last push to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also took no part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a clever calculus race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head out and then recovering them after 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Kenya's Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and the trials of life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the big Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black town incorporated into the country and the childhood site of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools, and not a jail."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described — making it also a tourist stop through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of Depression Season — remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida are often reluctant to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who doesn't know what is being lost."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
"We're very cautious about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be correct."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South – sometimes scorned, sometimes praised – that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten inward black history and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Off the road on the left," he wrote, "is the modern Maron public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continues.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the '20s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no grand memorial ceremonies, no grand public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Ms. Hurston.
A certain shift came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community's main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
"During that season, a bunch of white guys would go around town throwing oranges and everything at the people sitting next to them," Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl, once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being cuddled — I remember this — it was customary to hug the teacher morning and night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of the nonprofit Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white – there's a cultural gap there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who overcame prejudice, just as she did, with buoyancy, confidence and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her to American standards.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The idea resurrected from the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call bend speed, a true civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, began to show up in large numbers, and residents began to revisit the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a resurfaced and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: Just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can, at times, feel like you're on a street of the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its significance, are often still treated with caution.
Advance permission is required to do most interviews, and some things — like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the fields — can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a soft spot for bright red, still fear that her island da community could be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of natal pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to view Eatonville the way Mrs. Hurston viewed her entire race: beauty, and all problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, dumb, and mixed.
It's a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, who he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stand up and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city."
Around here in New York, everyone is talking about finances
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the storm.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are daily faced with the worst "bad office day" since the crash of 1929.
Delivery guys continue to beep their metal tea carts across sidewalks and carry trays of breakfast meeting muffins.
Latino men continue to drag between laden apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric patterned shirts slung to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel at the vendors' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a line of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the clerk's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where longtime customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek directions to Macy's department store, and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason I did.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had been switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a building society), from the credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose brancas only function within the state of belonging, and which claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which most of the bailouts on Wall Street are doing.
Ordinary people in New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grief-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fiftieth and somewhat of a janitor in my apartment block uniform, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my groceries to the grocer.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Lives to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s – just refuse to give up to the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical weeding, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
if any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, for any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known around the world."
We will miss a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his Séquela de William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... At the same time I was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate degree."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques with a red line running through.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, over some of the graves, but investigators think this may have occurred because of an attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way election-related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim clerics as the month of Ramadan was drawing to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the shift to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that captured nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had run a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were deemed xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered Islam-related.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties seek to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the Islamization policy underway in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out in the immediate aftermath of the election, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the shift came mainly from young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the ban on overseas travel last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by solicitor Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested an order to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad because he was under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
And it is also necessary to inform the police of the expected date seven days before your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all potential risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he was eventually flown to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A Home Office source reported that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master off stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Fotógrafo
No heels or ruffles or premiere costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration on interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
To one side the artist.
To the other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments alien to the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be ordinary people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on stage... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco".
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1.997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, getting to know them and being able to enter their life for a moment, whether it is a long or short moment.
I think that within photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, that sometimes you do not know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that concerns him today "is reckless" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens -, filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to which the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined manner" to make up for his "lack of inspiration" with intense documentation work, correcting and redoing a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced their vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied," so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "assume responsibility" their vocation.
The weather reduces the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of bars
The celebration of rejones that closed the subscription of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after verifying the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The cartel was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a confinement of Castilblanco
Thus, only on Friday there was celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante ended his two horns with greetings and an ear, which granted more the lines than his bullfighting.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, which passed through the arena of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a task of relief he won the anger of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of Álava carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shoulder, at which time its two occupants got off to flee to the race through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally caught up with one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish, so they proceeded to transfer it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the license plate had been "folded" since it did not coincide with the one collected in the documentation of the van, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J. of 28 years, was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will go to court in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of medication
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the series Melrose Place, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers when trying to leave her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and when going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses. "
Soon after, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and entered the local jail around 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that must make a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favorable deals to relatives.
"For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Llamazares on the action that the party must adopt with which until now councilor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the leader of IU defended the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions."
'Sangre de mayo', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the sets and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a foolish Spain that was wrong as a boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII",  has pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had financing like that of Alatriste or The ghosts of Goya - more than double that of Blood of May -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, because it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Nominated for an Oscar on four occasions - of which he won once -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema,  "Which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco styles to me.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one in his shows, as he did in "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
"Matilde plays Tortola when she grows up, the character of maturity.
I'm happy that he agreed to act in my play and I'm very honored by it."
The assembly also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence at a certain time and now nobody knows, much less values her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 20.30 hours at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recently Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008),  organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and that,  after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, it is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Reciencasado Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look they had a hard time giving him an Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very sick.
Even so, it has been a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and of the country had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem in tatters, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you have left, you do not have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of his firstborn who died of an overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shock wave of admiration sweeps Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and to have a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He divorced once but then was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why should I eat hamburger away from home, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud of as that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race by far I have ever been in.
A height of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I examined, it would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the bib, which makes you have to go before.
Which does not seem bad, but if they already make you go that they give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Not really.
Here they only made you go to pick up the number (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer and cheaper fabrics?
Well, things like this are a minutia compared to those on race day.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was coupled with attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I think that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not enter into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT, Microsoft has shown a preview of a new image recognition system and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) attending to what it hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit anyone and tells him that he will attend to him shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been talk well above a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
Quite a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It serves the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer boots only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windowing environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less ornate, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft's employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
At the soda machine a sign asks them to use its search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010.
Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, is becoming more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that strong man with a pointed mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's undershirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the English-speaking call it, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all others.
First, because of its bombastic name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for underwear comfort.
Although it is a pity to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to alleviate to a large extent the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Likewise, the Japanese firm expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more of trunk capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first mechanical 1.2-liter obtains a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This engine - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mom; The candidate doesn't worry me."
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is petite but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins over short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; From there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and observe women as they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
Since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rummage through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You already know that dancers really like to make our outfits for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You have turned 30 not long ago, have you entered a crisis?
What goes.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
For me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks me to do so and, besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are aware of several premieres that you shot last year.
That's right and I'm already looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I'm looking forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I got on a catwalk to play model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to come to London to participate in a charity show for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Also, I'm sticking with that very good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to make the pine, then also.
For benefiting women in the third world, whatever it takes.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this tiny robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision avoidance capability of the brand's vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately results in collision avoidance.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right angles or greater to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, or diagonally; It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn't require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This is the first step in developing new instantaneous collision avoidance technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium-ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Repeat drivers for breathalyzer must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for breathalyzer, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a road safety re-education course.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving get back in the car.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when detected an alcohol concentration is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviors before they lead to criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, nevertheless, the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., the time scheduled in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you will not be able to go to the airport to load at that time... She's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she is Spanish but lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in Mexico City a storm threatened.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the big four in the city, a reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
Tremble before you mortgage
Admittedly, the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on subprime mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the navigator: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
In other words, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the messes.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detailed.
It's more of a page for teens than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
The best endowed award in fashion
Possibly there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and beautiful living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, made us end up in a luxury dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart of grief and making guts heart, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron de Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed with a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hint of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk through the palace premises, but before she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the eyes of Olivier Martínez - another cannon who travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is not 1000 but 1000 plus a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic rhythm imposed by current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily burnout and the problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from the yoga positions, the classic massage or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach bookstores by the hand of the Pearson Alhambra publishing house and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' belies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore balance to the body and stress has become an issue, it's time to sit on the couch, unplug your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very clever telling us something that has happened the day before, but to children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens maybe you get a scare, but in reality it does not matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquios.
It is quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (peeing asleep) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress situations or overexcitement.
Anyway it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, single words, a murmur or the opposite (shouts, crying, long speeches ...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him an outlet in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will favor that the child can have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the somniloquias appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Do not wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed for several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not fall into the temptation of questioning him to extract information.
You will not achieve anything, because when he is asleep he is not conscious enough to organize his thought.
In addition you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their home ground after a long period of scarcity.
Without having played a good game, the team created many scoring chances and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by captain Kauffmann who grazed the squad with a shot from distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two chances from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoring for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But striker Illhousiens won't be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return in the locker room a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed up a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important bluff, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals ".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the increase in diesel prices, which marks a record by reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers ".
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, wooden tires and pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trading ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris ", announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the financial break-even point of a vessel can be reached with diesel fuel with a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable "Two Men and a Destiny" singer has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the movie legend and engaged actor, Paul Newman, who has died at age 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has delivered 215 aircraft this year despite threats of recession weighing on the global economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would aim to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out by U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with due proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, that is, a loss never seen in the stock market of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The tech-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 widened index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis earlier in the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the blueprint to save the banks that would have allowed some stability to regain in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted several days from now will come "too late."
"If the project is really moribund (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, the N. Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further," said Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes the collapse of a financial institution is announced" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, authorities arranged for rival Citigroup to buy Wachovia's banking activities.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3.632%, down from 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year note 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japan's MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after discovering an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at the unit price of $25.25, or an amount of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a yield of 10% and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measurement of 29 dollars, that is, 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but it passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
" A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the CEO of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and hedge ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $47 or so, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had greatly eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock price halve as the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Re-establish the republic around twenty-first century socialism.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had said, congratulating Ecuadorians heading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft constitution implies the increase of the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currency sent by its émigrés.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll of public opinion published last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% to McCain's 44%), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among undecided voters, Obama won with 39 percent of respondents, while 25 percent of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of the same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertisements.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Unfazed, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced their ability to make good decisions, and to restore America's image in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood," replied, this weekend, a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans. "
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the character most capable of saving the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a longtime member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current funding disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain ".
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the shocks of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closing of polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: " the dictator has to resign ".
Some admit not having voted: "for what, because they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to effect democratic change.
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are deemed fair to observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been placed on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and proposed laws. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must begin the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalisation of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulations.
"Have you noticed the elections? It interrogates Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition deputies to parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the Plaza de Octubre.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central election commission congratulate themselves on its success.
The 19 abductees have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have been unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulo to another.
The group was made up of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, in the special forces," he said without elaborating.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV on board which were the kidnappers, killing six, including the Chadian commander and arresting two.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the culture fait les manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our wealth like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is dedicating three and a half million euros to the restoration of the Château de Chinon alone in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that heritage protection is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected citizens and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped into 211 history, heritage, archives and genealogy societies are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is these that are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with energy and desperation when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective suppliers of blood in the world.
And above all, it regained the trust of the public that had been seriously wavered by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and make recommendations so that such a disaster does not recur again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust," he says, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population henceforth had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " trust is extremely fragile. "
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in Europe, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we establish exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, some years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that make it possible to detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
The nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the moment in which the person has been infected and the moment in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worry," says the head of the Héma-Québec directorate.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary pursues, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"Needs increase because the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the network of blood donors, which brings together on average only 3% of Québecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people in good health, aged 18 and meeting the eligibility criteria, can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since life today is so rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate her blood," grieves Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart leaflets, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing in the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this ", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division Qualifying Series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in short) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many scoring chances.
Roger Levesque was the only one to thwart Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the series of home-and-away games, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The team composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian on the barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
" I need another game to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play as much as possible in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest deals with the North
The prime minister does not exclude from launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (of the left), tries to get elected during today's by-election.
Reject the limits of our last great northern frontier": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
Paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media such as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this autumn, although he noted that his schedule was very full.
The " North Plane " is the fourth side of a "vision" the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space ", which includes a manpower agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe, and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel to immense potential ", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond ", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This " territory twice as big as France ", " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was calling for a national founding myth.
Quebec built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
" It belongs to us, it's our future, " he added, having taken a theatrical pause to gaze at the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Québec territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It's a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government, "he said.
In addition, " with climate changes, we have to rethink our vision of the North, " he said speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already begun consultations about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit ", but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given ".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to power in the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station into Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future ", declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This stays with us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, drawing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no trouble being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec demanded in particular recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad outlines of the Northern Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced applying it.
If he had, "we would make progress today," said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what you want is that this is not fair a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was an "embarrassment" to Canada.
To dishonor this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what says everything about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are reproached to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who encounters a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We still don't realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not make sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the hitherto minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six-million-euro defamation suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate ".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten whoever will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that it would have had to present its vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by blows of a stick.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and supporting letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; That represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public that supports Noir Canada's authors and publishers does so mostly because it rejects the mining company's brutal way.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a gag persecution (pursuing the " public debate ", Barrick Gold has just deposited a request regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university pursuit and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and debate the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The academic world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it intends, it does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: better control by those elected of its implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies helped.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
"We made great progress toward a deal that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would cause in the mood of investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, without forgetting however to express their discontent of being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to keep their domicile and the salary of the leaders of the companies survived by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: " I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it. "
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable."
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze in liquidity and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe we have broken the deadlock since Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of distressed companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
To smooth out the rough edges for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years under this program, it could impose new rates that would be intended to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 another billion can be added if the president deems necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get stakes in the relief companies that will earn dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure proceedings concerning homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it voted on by the House of Representatives from today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he's still not sure his plan will pass.
Some people continued to protest this bill yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that " with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand. "
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the taxpayer profit."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and to examine carefully the path to be taken," he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after French bank BNP Paribas said it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the U.S. subprime housing crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not wasted money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained voting rights in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Compromised Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the register of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years of the pomp.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic agreements.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, latest quality brand.
Because it projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied drama at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of show business that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while his great roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cow-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the zinc roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to Us (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Blow), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him above all thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With one last role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the career quite early, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its pomp and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young heartthrob than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, scumbag or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides of his true modest sensibilities.
His film Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " my life and my country were better because of his existence ".
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a rebel against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of its face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal process will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, business, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in public tenders, justifying on many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
Public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety about HUF 65 million - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the investigators, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
For this they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the falsified invoice should be made was decided among others in that tour of the Superior Region of the Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to make the invoices that they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Well, a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of high-fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems he did not agree that according to the bill one hundred people stayed, since they have only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organises trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a journey within Hungary, which was also not consistent with the agency's invoice issuing practice.
In addition, as it became known during the investigation, they included VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with 25 but only 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued typed invoices however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" also made other mistakes, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out road transport to which - it was learned during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - the company founded as an investment consultant does not perform.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was learned that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI, are false. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, which is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They knowingly issued the invoices
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF in the name of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The next group of manufacturers of false invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade of fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 has been under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for Atlasz, for Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned due - according to the defendant - to the fact that they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, they issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the limited partnership Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a competition to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
Lest this be discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably recount in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this he has not done so to the present.
The question is: what is the interest of doing so?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but it was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far greater value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for sentencing, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of overlays: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games the participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, when losing the game the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the real value of the product in question, and its members gambled.
Another group was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more in prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winning" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's economics school.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; Liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Pathogen-dependent hepatitis viruses are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humor (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and in the whites of the eyes jaundice, the stool becomes clear, the urine dark color and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die worldwide from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of those infected do not know they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore premature recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease can be cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at a higher level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves for more than a year, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will almost certainly sell a part of its businesses, including mainly the mainly insurance activities bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The shares of the Fortis began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too big to allow it to fail.
The company's shares on Friday were down 12 percent, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp drop in Fortis shares to the insecurities of the North American market in relation to the approval of the US package plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, stocks were already slightly higher.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was named as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's customers so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in what way influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside the academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; They attached a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, Sassoferrato's 17th century work and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with the Ermine from the 15th century.
The researchers had hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the religious subject painting or the other.
Catholics said that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as "protected" people, "they were calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts."
Looking at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, such as for a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: what effect would it have on pain regulation if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday Google can say: he can be found both in people's pockets and in the sky above his head; He knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "Let's gather all the information in the world in one system!"
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to treat all the information.
To the question of what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied like this: he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would be best for me?" - however, software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions until there is enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Internet, the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they passed at the end of the search are stored precisely.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can return to consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches – in this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they use my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care watching Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only do they keep, but in justifiable cases they also transfer to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its Web page, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who care about people's rights, in the month of May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully proved in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced.  through none of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand phrases searched under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is how the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed by starting to use Google services, and rebel against it as against multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, or money for its applications, the code is open and the program package is constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and leveraging available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog,  where the latest photo galleries are automatically displayed and stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the girlfriend, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of common friends, finds out with whom her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company:  One thing is for sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "online" life is what he shows of himself - this is the definition behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who want to hide something, or at least want to dodge Google's monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid being found, but Google's online applications can be replaced, from text writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day when Google shows its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten ad agency revenues, while services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft,  but also to numerous other software development companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, senior management flatly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's daycare, considered the unlimited number of employee meals too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company. The deal leaked any information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it is ready to go, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir the World: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be summoned by the Court. Supreme of the United States, others fear their Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyzes, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database can provide good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwellian form that future, in which a man only from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the traces of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the General Commissariat of Public Order of Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were accused of, and are currently accused of being perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday of last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, since he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech business daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far offered offerings.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - writes The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor," which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it is more correct to speak of a "second September 11."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's opinion, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system grows more and more and this will then have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington offers no political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - notes Geneva's Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts at tottering financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, as domino, more banks crumble, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, European Union member states need to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, Viennese Der Standard recalls, adding that concerns are growing that European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more real.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis that passes like a cuname through the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example that of bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C robotic steering system imitating nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
An important role is played by the compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid the collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the vehicle's robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used rotary movement and acceleration as well as braking as a possibility for the robot of the car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, much less the storage.
This device in every second only has to process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memories are needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to Nissan's calculations, within ten years can be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the existing obstacles in his way.
This very expensive child already has a name
The written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars has been prepared that will be applied in several phases in order to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to Eastern Coast time during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the US Congress, affirming that it remains only to formalize the agreement in a document.
The compromise made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment said: "This programme will work and be efficient but further action is needed. According to Pelosi, it's not about saving Wall Street, it's about turning the economic bandwagon around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 pm, according to Washington time (that is, before two in the morning on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization of 2008, on Monday the US Congress will vote first and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy shoddy credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of which the Finance Ministry will buy poorly rated credit fund securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion may be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the elements of concern, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: The law ensures in such a way the necessary financial means, that it can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it," he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and waiting for help from the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which American jargon simply calls a golden parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes unless the bank's failed head retires.
By buying bad loans outright, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses' severance payments are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation on CEO income will be in place, said Barney Frank, a Democrat who chairs the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they will even be able to make a profit with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill, over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were urged by the very people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise

The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, with 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8%), mainly due to a 4.6% monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5% increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials industry (1.6 per cent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimal extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the sectors of the processing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight in domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was registered in August, first as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Over the past year, the processing industry globally increased prices by 10.2 percent.
The prices of electricity, gas, heat and water supply exceeded by 18.7 percent the prices of the previous year.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in the prices of the energy sector and intermediate sectors there were no changes from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared with the same month last year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediary industry (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods producing industries, there was a decrease of 6.8 per cent and in investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent from the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 per cent against the euro and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that around January 12 the US-Hungarian agreement on visa waiver will enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic in time."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry permit will disappear, but tourists must register before leaving the country of origin.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice presenting him with the Medium Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain favor of the banks' bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured on Sunday their support for the administration's $700 million bank aid program, while there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced early Sunday morning: a principled agreement was reached on the financial rescue package for the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival of pulling the country out of economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues came to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared the McCain advantage he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly ... jobs are in danger, your savings and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with the ABC, McCain explained that "we will all swallow this with difficulty (...) But doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the minister of finance and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that lawmakers will likely vote as early as Monday on the bill.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
The Christian Socialists for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian Democrats, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been expected for almost ten years was completed: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago, in the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is, even during the much mentioned era of Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the province devouring its progenitors.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most aware, most critical and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, small industrialists, those with high school and graduates.
This resulted in less than 40 percent support for the CSU.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily: "Who with whom? In his article entitled "Party presidents are very secretive in coalition matters" - he deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens on the other hand do not yet want to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already taken place, now everything is about the coalition; In the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, hosted by France, which this year is also the rotating president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MEP of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of Fidesz deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Roma.
For the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more possibilities he will have to become an active member of the labor market; Through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Roma, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for which the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility guaranteed by the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum for promoting the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European level and at national level in the Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when viewing drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which binds the use of prescription data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the health status of the client and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the control.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the client.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, you indicate that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high, so you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration hardly has anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medications are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they did not receive a fine for the negligence of until now.
Some companies lately also elaborate the results of laboratory tests and combining them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the individual for the provision of their own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo hinted: they do not cling to their positions so much.
In doing so, they were intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organisation, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, while now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they got only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the Southern Province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, the federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors enters parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased the ambitious local politics from the stage.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also who until now was moving the strings in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU described September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks at the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to jointly enhance the CSU that played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU's losses will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is naturally relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexander Lukashenko, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million people, composed of one hundred and ten deputies, has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy,  as a consequence of the amendment of the Constitution this time it would "allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to make.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union,  that does not give entry to Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians because they have a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's OSCE primary report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
With all this, in the opinion of the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is felt: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations upon seeing the results, rather it tries to get its message about the need for economic reforms to voters.
- This of course causes us many problems because we must print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities make it difficult to distribute it, but even so I see that more and more people support the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security,  Not even retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the scheme, consider it adequate.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "resembles the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russia's Ria Novosti news agency: "People do not believe in words but in deeds," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more say in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, rotating President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is, increase to more than one hundred billion euros,  its commercial exchange.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
This legally harmonised the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's largest trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit turned its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate program, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce until 2050 with fifty percent the production of greenhouse gases.
They also wanted to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international book exhibition in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Exhibition expects for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural assets and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italy point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the picture will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present issues, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of personnel.
But from today it begins with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
"Now opens a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is Reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been met by the employees, says the general secretary: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on their part."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; No more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that means 60,000 more people to work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to render the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have united to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the association of consummaters - the people of the 'lazy workers' are continuously increasing.
There are indeed millions in Italy of correct and productive public administration employees who have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the TAR will answer the exclusion of aggregate economic treatments for illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Neapolitan: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the very tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association Mutilated and Disabled by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness."
"It has manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Of particular significance are the numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an urgent end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive progress, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want, effectively, that this 'tendency to decrease' translates into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"A further effort is useful - he added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers with respect to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years."
"The objective is to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time."
Mp3 readers under accusation, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission says, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - reads the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity".
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones may unconsciously ruin their ears irretrievably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific evidence – EU responsibility continues – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is sensitizing consumers and rendering this information into the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the heavy use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
"The scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that it is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices".
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern is growing as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and exposure time to noise.
In its view, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be done.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bun" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno tends to emphasize – It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse themselves.
There is no position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal end.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work done for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that manifest themselves back in turn.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes".
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current communal confines but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He has written an American politician who is interested in passing for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two black governors and five senators!"
They are actually attacks that don't say much; They are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
One side of the American mentality comes out covered to the last.
"Whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before now, that it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever will take over from George W will have an enormous duty to perform.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism nationwide is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against issue.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are opening a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has risen to 79%.
All 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers – that is, the editors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job safety".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $ 10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For vacations, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get "sick" often during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the scope of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he has obtained the house release, transforming it into a compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the salvation plan of 700 million dollars launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday's New York Times confirms that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance.  strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This barely cited is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but in the entire West and not only here only.
Both in the United States and in Europe for some time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in effect, is a crisis of banking institutions - which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but it is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which divided as always between different interests and different state strategies fails to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is reached it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization can ever dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is perfectly in tune, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the math more and more with the little immaterial things like water,  crops and oil.
All things that, mind you, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is as sovereign certainly has many more cards than he who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but presages a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate economic species relieved with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, a intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in increasing numbers.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain.  to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format I would say some, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews.  It increases and potentially agitates excessively.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like spider-man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to glue a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "detaches easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the School of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALK ALONG THE WALLS? "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk on the walls exactly like spider-man? Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of California, Berkeley, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hairs that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged than fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice,  orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was retained responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
DRUGS TO RISKS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case a drug such as Diasepam or Methane is being assumed.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicinal ones that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or pharmacist "said the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Economics Novel to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's biggest critics of economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the attack of September 11, 2001, in those days that bankrupted Enron, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered much controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but now it has been revealed to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public eye," Krugman told the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a popularizer with a "very aggressive" style, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from the home to the office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year on the part of the volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to multi-functioning with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of the modificas, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at the http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html address and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also tests positive for fourth doping case
New positive case in the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best rower of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive rider to the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood champions' tests are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that he is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will go against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positive doping to third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he had notified Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy as a country of emigrant has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern league.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by the Pope or by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedetto XVI in Congress, has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism."
Steve Fossett's plane found the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3000 meters altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is typical of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance "he said in a stamp conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The millionaire, 63, has been presumed dead in February.
The American office for transportation safety (NTSB) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is typical of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name on them, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in a hot air balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the tour of the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An SUV outside the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain trucks of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own for the content out of the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the SUV Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping mall, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car goes outside the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula capture the interest of future buyers? See.
It's clear who the Italian hooligan are.
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports events is at stake.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They inspire English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
La Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among what had come out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have had their tickets refused and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
"We have to put out this fire right away and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say of the Interior Ministry.
Therefore, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National League match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is to say the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a challenge ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the place that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a challenge to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds n.1 of the Observatory - the challenges are attributed in the countries in which the event occurs.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's hymn: those are also not a challenge, but if they allow they are not polite either..."
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study to a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents. "
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, without canon limit, linked sub-rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of tax taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask you approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Savings are made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed they serve you 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed they serve you 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic cinemas
Historic cinemas close favoring Multiplexes.
"A city without movie theaters in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono cinemas in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes,  that told the poetry of a provincial movie theater and nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them are paid for by the main cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is typical of these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new meticon cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of merchants: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year. "
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the mono cinema either in the historic center or in the periphery.
Among the planned rules there are means of fiscal facilitation in favor of managers and advantages for the public in mobility terminations: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
"It's an initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of the meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer grandson, namesake of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norm, and in good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed - write the judges - to officially enter the interior of the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the May 2006 runoff, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
A scandal exploded when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call the deputy minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families."
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and is being discovered now, the great world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was pushed aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil prices give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – the spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important signal, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, pending only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, spins the turbine vanes, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electric energy, merits at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is especially about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coasts, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
