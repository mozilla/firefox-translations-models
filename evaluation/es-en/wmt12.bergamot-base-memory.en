Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantaged agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet final, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even doubts have arisen in the West about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which sentenced the former prime minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to define who the winner is
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is about elucidating whether they are moderates or radicals
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be joined by the Quran.
In Libya, an order will be established which we cannot imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only or objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it does not cease to surprise that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they seek victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals are not a problem to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation will the oil companies get the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
Whenever the followers of the Sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are going to hunt for the investor search engine
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market has broken records today.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical cabinets in the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already released their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France’s 0.4%
Both countries have made the data of the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ the trend of gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year, but quarterly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to seasonally recalculated and previous data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on your ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation is also beginning to affect Austria, Holland, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany, voices are raised that say the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a 200 million premium.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the home team, so that the European championship event will not be missing.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the match in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let two great occasions pass.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the coffers of national football will receive an approximate gratification of 200 million kronor.
From the first minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were determined only to maintain the lines and played nothing more around the midfield.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed at noon Tuesday before the facility and then chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in which uranium is being worked.
They seek to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is struggling to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, the Isfahan power plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner stuffed
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children come mostly from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated what is the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had had French fries dinner the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and almost 900 Basic Education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the same.
It was already the second edition of the program of "Obesity of is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of children who are overweight and even obese.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals daily depending on the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” the survey’s results said.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for breakfast as a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find that in 10% of households nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane potato chips are consumed much more often.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far removed from the ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is above all alarming the popularity of sweet soda," the study's final report said.
As the main food, the pasta is taken and the poultry is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legume and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet," the results of the study point out.
It is striking, for example, about sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children would also more often choose poultry meat and fish for the main food in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures of three professionals of the field, how to dress problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We are time studying with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone is a neck, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the Jennifer Lopez type stand out, huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it in an overly challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not adapt, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of custom fabric.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a bespoke skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the assigned task, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to be cut from magazines or search for them on the internet and print them, and then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only physically dresses, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is over for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in various ways.
Variability is essential in this case.
Thus, such a trench coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in high heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it is enough to roll it up and raise the neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if later it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are alone, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must keep in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a very different size to theirs (less).
Then it only remains to guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During his work, above all, he must communicate with the people he dressed, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the costumes and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can not take and throw everything there was and say: "fuy what a horror".
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on,” Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job board.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, linter removers, or unmissable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such that bags or hats), special garment hooking tweezers in front, if it is larger (pins and other hitches are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a set of sewing.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more so.
And we did nothing but line and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we couldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservation.
The truth is that I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everyone we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a path of pink, but I do not care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes across America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of carelessness unsuitable from a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, raised great expectations before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result, it appears as a game that should not end up being again an action genre without more.
We also feel curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be taken for acceptable, but in total counting points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
He introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
It is nothing of the other world.
But the desert walk, autumn landscape or high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury you an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a number of rivals demanded (normal in a classic race), then try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which does nothing but make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer much, but you can’t claim to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with enough action is quite good for this driving style, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, the same is no longer true for collisions.
Games of this type can not be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but you can get cranky.
Resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five available resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something does not go well, but it is not very trusting.
Sometimes, neither reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the encounter in opposite directions, your opponent overtakes without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen before your nose.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
In addition this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to get the vision of the cars that come head-on, so at first you can make the car porridge.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you are sure to be disappointed right away.
And it’s a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that there is no boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline pumps next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the driver is open to him several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes available other community functions.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you reach the metro tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark by the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you the metro convoy and takes you ahead without more.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
Well, it is too shame that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game were to avoid absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but prepare because the mistakes will hit you in your eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nova:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war to be mounted without quarters."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," began with conviction his lecture at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe every body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, since it would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vice-Nova was also considering the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing comes the criticisms, that if he is bland, a gray official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call her?" This is an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union for states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vice-Novena has also taken care of the agenda, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or jargons that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe is waiting for us to speed
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive rather the negative aspects than the positives.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says to me: "What, you have already been, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that it is not funny to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nova, is awaiting by new very harsh budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new one of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the cooperation procedure strengthened."
"It was said for the first time that only countries they want and those who don't, that they stay out will cooperate."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the Europe of two speeds," Vice-Novaá is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the closest would be “long term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was put by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his label, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous move in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century," said Samuel J, the current director of the company. Palmisan.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 30’s, was concerned with the care of his employees as the businessman of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first U.S. operatives to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salespeople.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, I could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, for which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that they come up with ideas, because almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist professor and IBM book author Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” says George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Great Green” – as it is known in the U.S. family because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill 220 billion dollars this year. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it can't be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J said. Palmisan.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this differentiates the competition, Microsoft, which basically always stays and falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and fifth are teams.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets for a total value of US$15 billion. During the same period, it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first manifested.
IBM acts on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that so far the company IBM has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
You can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutting Machine to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "signing clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help you with the management of the company.
The new leader overshadowed the IBM founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, the turnover doubled to 9 million dollars and the great expansion of the company through the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost after forty years occupying the boss’s chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
It aims to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not yet been improved, for example in terms of transport and city management.
For the trade sector, IBM introduced not long ago the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country that had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Here too, there is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
She even publicly stated that she loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship, and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář one day broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live not as my dear old borrico who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am united with certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that he had already disengaged from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care so far that he's been a woman closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed, Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová were to find a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Josef concludes.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also mean you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to bring the blood to the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who has dependence on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one wipe in the week?
Do you like to buy often on sale?
So in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let’s see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around clothing stores, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner that you’d better wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Amn't I too fat?"
"I would need to lose weight for at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
What do you do?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not occupy being primordial in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make nasty comments
"Used underwear is left in dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow"
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will get it out of your boxes.
Naturally. You don't want to say anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women are also doing slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes runs away a small, harmless gossip.
With a hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossip women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women’s work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromir Jágr took part in the NHL match Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and puts Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star’s play, and went one step further and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had already told him that he would triple."
"I presented it."
"Sometimes they look ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first stroke of the Flyers.
A while later the second intervention of the team had a Czech trail.
Voráček took the album behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot sneaked in for the fourth of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly in the top three," Jágr told his centre-back.
"I never would have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very pleased with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalty, until getting a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow further complications, although they ended up outnumbered in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance on our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to stick to the album and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček wrote the final goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead of the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the home coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but against that you can't do anything, we have to deal with it," Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to further simplify the game, get the record off our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg appearances in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia at that time only five authorized state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, because travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually or even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but one was to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their vacations in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way of traveling of the Czechs has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was not the more it is not going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the destination currently favorite, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990’s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, didn’t look fed up with the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income of that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take the food (preserves, sausages, etc.) with it to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to prepare travel using charter connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
By the end of the 90’s of the last century, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the U.S., which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year for distant and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visited by about 100 thousand Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15 thousand Czech kronor per head have been spent on abroad, including expenses on the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in a deadlock.
For almost five months Czech football has been without president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you can not even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his position in June not before summoning his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to take care of football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Hašek era, a controversy was sparked between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached or as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and due to this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer shed or the Executive Committee which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion about the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is this: how do you proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate can win with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," Svoboda understands the Moravian side's objections, which would be best not to touch order and vote under the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like you to vote to the maximum according to the statutes."
“So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first running as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk he will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so it will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match begins if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement is reached.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak sport federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), nor would he run for such a relevant position.
"If there was a proper person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election."
"But to this day such a person has not been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter into the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that role he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could keep in mind."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at this time they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly most upsets Paclík at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case I win, the current status would remain and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less of a profit," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "I would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta become president".
In the case of winning Thursday’s election, Paclik could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one he would follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my noses where I don't feel capable," Paclík added, who in September drew close attention to supporting the suspension of the Committee of Referees chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits he would dare to manage the partnership.
He resorts to his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who with his support celebrated in May the victory in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues that the new president should be dedicated to."
"If they raised taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce it, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically giving up my actions of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and on raising funds.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People of all levels take care of football for a long time and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist,” says Pelta.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had not attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the world of football for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," Pelta, who remains true to the statements announced already in September, told his opponent.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the upper competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
"It would also try to solve all the scandals that emerged because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told the ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the squad.
"I would have to know first the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly manage to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would begin to work eagerly.
If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected in the fourth General Assembly as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, hard work would be done.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He also pledges to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee's competencies in such a way that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people this probably won't like it, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others."
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every turn," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"A lot of people have told me that I should not give up, because then others would also give up."
"It's about having faith not to leave like that, just," he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a big part of the work was finished that I don't want to be lost now."
"There are processes that had begun and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the time of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in someone's favor."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because only then will everyone and not just the chosen ones feel good," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that would only be bohemian the president.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and another Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although to the struggle of the presidential election was added Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel like I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which he chose me as his vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes comprise saving a few tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of staff on committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in his luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome on top, swam towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "trip through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
He doesn’t want anything to do with the sport, Meder says, only the water is different.
He just minds that bathroom enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or hear the cheerful trills of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting nice pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in swimming pools is so great because you take care of every sense, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: high vaults, colored tiles, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the specimens highlighted in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest are the waters with nitrates in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as hot springs, whose pools are made of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the entire city sets its sights in the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a swim in St. Louis. Anton, y: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps more extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains it rises steam in winter, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not invaded by the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain baking soda and alkali and whose legamus sticks to the skin when entering the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bath, when he wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds grow between the tiles.
The decay countered in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after it; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements of their construction times in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans don’t find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials like wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a commissioned survey by consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, the results will then be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction of the raw material business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets at rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently hurting public welfare."
Ackermann is found as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts money into play for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people who go hungry or Deutsche Bank's fame."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank released that the chairman of the board will change something other than unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation, it can perfect its image.
And he needs to barely care about any possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were wagered.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would advise such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and would be changed to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of ups and downs architecture and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, became empty and crumbled.
It now reopens as an exhibition house.
The passionate modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was built after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly declining.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and also an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special security glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns of rough flooring in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The "which came from Brussels" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of urban luck has happened. The all-new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against breakdowns and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For what must be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the railway network even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, since, among other things, it was short of reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of a shaft at Cologne’s central station.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaire fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the contests due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA recriminates many large banks inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank admits no fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of 20.5 million dollars.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and supports bankruptcy to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to reimburse the losses of millions originated.
Agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked other large banks for accounts and in the summer litigation against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have instituted countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most demands.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business by a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it is about businesses worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests strongly in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the industry.
He must have understood long before that IBM offers above all services and provides computer systems for the information technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as an honor.
Therefore, the information technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently revealed on the economics station CNBC that it has acquired IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hasn't heard of the compromise.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technologies services as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided the technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
In contrast, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, lubricants manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
Su Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole range of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
But his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why he’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM stocks rose one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that is rekindled.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin, it has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost returned, which was long overdue, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no further episodes of violence had occurred with a far-right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned whether xenophobia exists in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not foreseeable.
"Is bloody ideology rekindling?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil before the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary", reads the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” reads the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He emphasizes that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the German internet forums of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are shocked that the German authorities have not sought suspects in the far-right circle much earlier.
Some is shown to be the least rhetorical in terms of the drastic media: "From now on here it is lost, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weaponry."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network," writes "Selen."
Which means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, then mainly the deficiency of German politics after the attacks was criticized, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped bombing of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The bank of the lake scandal in Zurich
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now a German is running it.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind observations about its future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The chairman of the USB board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early in 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, professor of economics and counselor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just again proved that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems so, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discrete and solid Swiss goods manager, but also tricky, was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banking teacher in Zurich for many years explains: “In front of my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank.”
"From the current point of view, you ask yourself: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally, that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 on Switzerland’s second-highest-paid board of directors, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misinvestments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, whereby it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over data from wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped in tax fraud.
He simultaneously lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods through the aid to tax fraud.
And just when something calmer was back, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate history of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it unveiled, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
"With the Adoboli case, it is stated that risk controls have changed too little," said Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
From what arose the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been presenting themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
For years, the Swiss banks have been residing here: from the national bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elitarian private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception room is entered by a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
There is talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but asleep bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Eventually, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The destination came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lowering the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In currency trades and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisors of companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost costs its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for selling U.S. mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the descent for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The positions on the UBS became projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss realms.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decrease a lot, it is currently clear.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he prevailed: He must permanently run UBS business, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors early in the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain unfollen.
The industrial production slowed on the continent stifles the hope of stabilizing at its source a crisis caused by indebtedness.
General relief on changes of government in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems come back to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed in the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the American tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the price of the shares of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the trend in the market at first just a higher percentage.

Smart frogs spread in cities
In many places the slaps are considered "problematic birds": these intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grejos have been in the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate for the crap and the noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The cracks no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on hats in Leer, East Frisia.
There the specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field from certain protected strips; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, increasing building and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The slats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to kill the district’s straws jumped to the headlines in the press.
Critics have called the hunting of the animals through bird traps and murder with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expelling them and scaring them away in a normal way you can get nothing" said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Scaring them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of scaring animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to re-establish themselves elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a beak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's pigs in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the sluts not only take advantage of the resources to access shale snacks, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four slots how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning farms had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the pipe shooter.
Three of the four sluts got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Euro 2012.

Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).

At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free kick from more than 30 meters to get to the head in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show off in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the team of Wolfsburg, leader of the English Manchester City sent a header to the club, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit the Czech Republic
Then, the collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European vice-champion of 2004 clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81 minute. with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualified for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40 minute. of the front lap, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the spar of the world-famous goalkeeper, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was due to leave his seat on the third-party bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro final.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball inside the goal either.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him get any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute. made room for Ivan Perisic, of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionnaires of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to Euro
In Dublin, the Irish have been taking the first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane had his first big shot.
From the first moment, the stone defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32 minute, he overtook it.
After a defender of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting the 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall soul at his feet.
Here are some acting tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"The beauty and pain of battle "combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or they will lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives blink here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mixture while others go out.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from standard history books.
It is also a corrective of the notion that the First World War was only the dire trench war on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" is expertly moved through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on top of the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that sucks into a chord.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Defecibility of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and getting them right with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Succedaneous, everywhere substitutes."
"Succedenal of coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the Swedish food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he observes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy and studded breastplate."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
“Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it might happen in front of the audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a condemned man being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced in good-made clothes that executes his butcher shop while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is agile but not extravagant, perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war of "exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell’s The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like No News on the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he's come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault on the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be emptyer.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was challenging for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "squatters."
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves watching the occupations develop in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye facing Zuccotti.
Officers increased so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know who were called to this, they were not told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district — dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going back and forth from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the fewest people in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated sharply by officers.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense tangle of personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags crowded with clothing, Department of Cleanup teams followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp were lay among them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “altering public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the superior officer in uniform in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
They rose barricades on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union will sue the city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s lowest-paid lost their job on Oct. 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund run by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school support staff members would be dismissed.
City District 37 officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latina women, as do most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been chronically undersubsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, demand says, “This is not a wealthy parenting neighborhood that can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. The district 36 budget dropped by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each school poor student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been fooled by language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surpise" to describe the action, even though it more often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the complaint draft says, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are set to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and America’s involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan affirmation of support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate over Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to pass or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never went so far as to be voted on in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a move that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory — with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually reap the grass under his feet.
The Congressional indecision was then overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the main Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-V.), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that in fact wins an assembly-wide vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have not been successful so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicate - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of such a move.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Representative Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illy.) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that it has been the members when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and filed 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn’t have much more success then than they have it now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Hit but not defeated, "Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range at a constituent rally in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, singing accompanied by the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Pretty good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special hour-long "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program was analyzing the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar piercing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband cheers her on.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word, "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that the music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: Congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who two hours ago of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she first stopped him to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you're going out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
The troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines broke into their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and cheered.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as a kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it was not respect, really. It was sorry.
Markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes, adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say service members.
The audience is increasingly acting as if they are given pain for those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B said. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us on the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations about the pity are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding work by Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Battlefield achievements are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were completely common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"An alarm signal sounded," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, alleging.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread violation among the military, in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the lawsuit initially implicated 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's major plane, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
Defense team for the Defense Department, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
For a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents read.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 50’s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars are rarely clear the front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service — a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women’s Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in how it handles benefit claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the assaults are remarkably under-reported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which figures at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military were on trial – half of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was put in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed him with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 it was dispensed from service on less-than-honourable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawmakers continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind it because it has no incentive and deterrence that the responsibility raises.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go her way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until the reform occurs,” he says.
"Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the far-right’s new face in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time he preceded his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s cache of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographics with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been using for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way to do research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men, and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their activism in line with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in “Likes,” wall messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, driving the number of site named academic papers in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the issue.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “punching” its own population to get data.
The Site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed – advocates of digital freedom long ago who argue that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online it’s an open bar for everyone.
“I don’t think a lot of users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with the public walls of Facebook students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline."
"Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he told a room filled with 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
Everyone attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs's Lost Interview Showed in Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been spent as a preview of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flowchart yonki – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawn of the personal computer, and sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively in his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the interview originals disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director’s garage.
This slightly reissued footage is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview, which hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
On four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers – 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, prompting him to go faster towards the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how you learned to run a business:
"Over the years in business, I always asked, ""Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way you do it."
No one knows why they do what they do, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting in detail.
Bewildered by the form in the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of a good bucket, and that then fit with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and yelling through the pay phone and going back a minute later to the next door’s pay phone,” Jobs says with a giggle.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We two didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think that Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and soliciting to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched Bill Hewlett for the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well it treated its employees.”
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathodic tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of motherboards, a client asked if he could assemble the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he remembers the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost 300 dollars], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90's...
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the big idea evolves, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't do that make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything comes down to taste - it goes down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were coincidentally the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Care Law Rivals While Court Accepts Case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained at a bar firm-sponsored dinner that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states in defiance of full health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit to the process and, in fact, a historic argument of 5 and a half hours is expected for March, and the result will probably further muddy the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court’s decision is known.
The attorney who will appear in court and argue that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a group that has spent many years dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary court hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most senior Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which reads: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event. "
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several magistrates who abide by the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were entertained in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say too easily mix court activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the trial court.
Critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law as to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record order of 18 billion dollars
Emirates asks for 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than a billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big transaction when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the sale price for all 50 aircraft is up to a record 18 billion dollars.
It’s as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 double-aisle Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs – it is not so damaging, because the country is making money from the oil price increase.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates’ order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger jet at bay.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to US$67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor’s race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers... They seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly outnumbered Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, came in third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderon’s home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive targeting traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections of Michoacán may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking forward to next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help bail out the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest-growing major economies had to "do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that look at Europe’s difficulties in a “unfair” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance coupled with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and Italy’s and Greece’s prime ministers have resigned.
Europe’s current sovereign debt crisis has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has prompted calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian trade minister, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depleting foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for the tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s billion two hundred thousand people, of which up to 800 million live with about 2 dollars a day or less.
"At some point they'll realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won't go well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the many, well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs from poorly managed companies, and generating losses like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial backlash from the Pentagon’s aisles, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the US$450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but it now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent of global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unable to be executed – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to license civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage goodwill."
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, the war’s efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in grassroots budgets,” Panetta said.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war."
"Payroller staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping at the Department of Defense would result in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"Abduction is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to occur."
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts, it remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in congressional and White House budgets and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a news conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, invite aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delay in time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and poses unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could tackle the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter jet, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground-based combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate some 80 billion dollars in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the vital next step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone asserting U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and online exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly slugged by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be best seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception are we?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
Surely, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been rebutted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush or restless.
It cannot be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation and times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more “self-oriented lies,” while women tell more “other-oriented” lies — usually to protect someone’s feelings — that married people lie less often than people who are not married (but the lies they often tell tend to be “huge”).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty in lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
It helps to provide benchmarks to then measure changes.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
You better know if someone normally hits with the foot all the time so they don’t make unfair accusations when they see their feet pounding in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward a way out, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely show that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used time spent while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distance language: "I didn't have sex with that woman...Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a bunch of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted following the threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are being studied.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible that it will split any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered independent testing of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada-hired lobby member Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva of disco music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stagewriter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing?' I said "yes" and went to catch her," he said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He was enraged and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve became hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," the girl's mother said.
LaBelle pounced on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and taken away from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, lowered foreign investment and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-described of change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of effects by the frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage of 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops killed were those of vegetables, corn and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate continued to be 5.28 percent, and between January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate went to be 5.28 percent, and between January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloansmore than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What you are seeing is an unemployment growth that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in Congress to combat money laundering, already for people who illegally claim dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there is the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI added 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government counts a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, mainly of companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be destined to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 it lacked the harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensively to recover the ground we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been being done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has been triggered," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term program be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its driving public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He is convicted of 8 kgs of marijuana
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the drug lord sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the 80th post, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trafficker was riding in a pickup truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the box of the vehicle and in the seat of the co-pilot a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentence remains in mate in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
He owes contributions for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although until now the construction programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource greater than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is made in force.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we to not delay we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It already happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued walking, and this year we to be able to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to rush the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth."
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog and digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to follow to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it provided for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into a better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "demand the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorship of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already concluded the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which invades in some way the sphere of competence of Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for in the Official State Newspaper Act, arguing that it had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and called the vote of the state president "invalid and illegal" to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the cases that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no act of scrutiny and calculation in the file of the box or not in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election concerned and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winner and the candidate located in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

A short meter away was the body of another individual with red t-shirt and blue denim pants.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the scene, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, since no shell casings were found on the site.
In the fence of the fifth you can see legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in it and the gate.

The new Italian government will form on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy combats a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the hit confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on Italian BTP bonds 10-years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the center-right party's secretary, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in your efforts could trigger a devastating new financial market attack.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels among uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the election.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be made up of only technicians, a hint of their qualms about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources said mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spanish is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 summoned came to the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranquin, count a wide record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity in league and domestic cup championships a year, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro and the World Cup football.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish National Team is the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s brain flyer, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the strike of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are left-back Junior Diaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outperformed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 performances in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not near 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam’s bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to turn the dream of playing in the country into reality.
This was stated by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with the Angeleno band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what his fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to get our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played for the past 21 years happened over the past couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, then we don’t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they have accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined we would be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years it looked like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you that you were a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a band from a city emerges, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with them all still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trusted each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure that not being too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and people who love your music.
While you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without becoming infatuated for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it would last so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why she was picked for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bassist, what are their influences?
There are so many.
Among the first to come about are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite not being a fashion anymore?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of her, she reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there is some trauma in your life and a family member or a friend is lost, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday for evaluation for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated on four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known innocent.
He was operated four times with cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been combined such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin on Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information in all that are the political affairs between the two nations," as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the realization of fiscal exchange agreements in order to get off the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustached plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, over the course of 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never until now had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said the head of specialized press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", since until now hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to take a "second round" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel mine platforms of dangers with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new features in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he proceeded with the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$ 70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision is due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentence had already ordered extradition.
He asserted that during his term "he did not put his hands" in judicial decisions and gave process to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did supposes an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president from between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has resolved his legal status in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock at an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradiction or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
Also attending the great hall of the Fabra i Coats were the current councilor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president put Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted a squatted estate where macro parties were made
The invaders had taken over 11 of the building’s 13 stories, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they occupied illegally yesterday, and where they organized macro parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took away the entire electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded feasts, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm made unfair competition, since they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the nightclub they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, according to him, the inconvenience is not caused by the customers of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the squat house and, above all, those attending the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and on almost all floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 the police went to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80’s, in full swing of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the WBC, in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that do not orient themselves on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola’s rating as a natural park is in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone pretends to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to use when two members of this old caste of elect recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have come forward.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can be started from the basis that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "like the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where you have to act".
Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from how "uncertain it is today to project public space" after the experience lived in the 80's and that had in the area of the Forum "its swan song".
The first fear is the delimitation of a border over where it can be built.
"To limit something is to fix the next step now," that is, its overshoot.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More closely at the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical issue.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall flat", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he points out) that have had to be created: "The architects should be only a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global vision of Collserola is missing: "16 transversal contests have been called -he says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, however, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, to the fullest extent, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and he will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal agent of the Red Casino granted the forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal agent of the Casino Red granted him the pardon before the Second District Penal Court, which follows a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regional city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney General’s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panista mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
In that place he remained for the following 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he only stayed for a few hours in the middle-security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was issued an arrest warrant for the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after inquiries, enough evidence was verified to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, the legal agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request the pardon for the brother of the mayor regio; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim may be lodged in the case of the process that was followed; in addition, he will not be required to repair damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal agent of the bookmaker, around 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
You will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people, lost his life
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people, died, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could attempt a hard landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations made in the impact area, the appearance of pieces on the ground is not reported.
"In a search they report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operated in cruise speed and that this happened in a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM located conditions suitable for takeoff, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloud cover were presented at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the conditions of cloud cover the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The dispersal pattern of the aircraft's remains allows us to assume that the helicopter hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
Evidence remains at the site of the accident in the wreckage of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the terrain.
During the fieldwork, pieces of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the middle level of the sea, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably dismantled along that path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned-off site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is directing research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research it is invited to participate in the population whether or not they are entitled, to go to the sports units participating in the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico Oriente).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
When World Diabetes Day was celebrated on November 14, he said that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels are applied to all participants (it is sought to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity, and girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by their genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a blend with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the potholes, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, one of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, she said, is bathed with asphalt.
When the vehicles are transited and efforts are generated, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would diffuse even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, a last layer is placed called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is moistened, the water diffuses into the folder and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to avoid that potholes are formed frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected for Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose(1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was the Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Road.
At the question the Vallecaucan replied:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said he felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist hinted that being the favorite, the ovatione and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craftsmanship, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on stage."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and his two parades in the coronation evening.
Although in both she looked safe, it was noticed that she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist with the program "Como at home", of the RCN Channel said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was at the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered points on her on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that was practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her fort and she was charged here."
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, she was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the Caleño who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4 a lophoscopist of the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top boss of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the matching of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the section of the CTI, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies that had to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano told Eliazar that he would wear clothes for a minimum of three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that it was suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the decacytillary card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local peasant, no glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints to those on the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top head of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a Dactilloscopist from the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the Lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When captured, many criminals file false or no papers.
We take the fingerprint and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, he does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscoper explained that on objects "prints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the television program CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective check is performed.
The "outraged" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday defied New York authorities by trying to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square where they were evicted early in the morning and trying to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to re-camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons for the "Occupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray said the response from the “outraged” to the eviction of their camp personally issued by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "outrageous" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured EFE that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and that has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square -which is a privately owned enclosure- is still closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed at this time copies of that court order and even handed them over to the agents who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibit protesters from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the protesters, which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", since "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
Those responsible for "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas television special
Alongside Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", bunny of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 bringing to life a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special of CTV has the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates figured the material losses at US$300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The one registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian momentum that invites us to take advantage of crises to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, pushed by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the price of the yen.
While the markets continue with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let its guard down.
"We must be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries had sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating the tipping points in the global economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
As it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even stood below the average, which is at level 100, with eight tenths to 99.13 points precipitate.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums fired and uncertainty reinstated in the parquets, Greece continues to entangle in the labyrinth leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed in his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26," Papadimos said, opening a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’s message does not clear doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.”
The Conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still snitched by the impact caused by the ordago of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment unambiguously and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a predominant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this intrument of cooperation, whose "essence" he pointed out that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a horizon 2015, and, "especially, in what has as its goal the reduction of the volume of people living with incomes less than a daily dollar, with which the "umbral of poverty" is set
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households leave the poverty line at which they are mired.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her loan policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and “in all I have been able to verify the continuous evolution,” explained His Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the term of the “head of family” gathered in Valladolid by the “baquero of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits represent "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluded from those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the solidarity spirit."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
On the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, it has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The several-minute standing ovation that was won, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is no less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to make way for Europe."
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the mood inside her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that he has tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a responsible fund of family subsidies and deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and helper.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, that starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the presidential campaign of the right, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of lack of private sector workers before it can take the leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of lack without remuneration in case of work leave (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that are applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of job leave.
"The checks are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand said in the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of workplace discharge fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue is constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally resulted.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look closely, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in benefits for work leave.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties represented, in 2008, 5% of health spending, amounting to 11,300 million euros.
Of this amount, 46% correspond to maternity leave and work accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6,200 million euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days of work leave, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not caught a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged, in France, from 10% to 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has caused more than 45 days of sick leave controls to be systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were “unjustified or too long”, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounting to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
No doubt, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to the work in black.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademo: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what he declared on Monday, November 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; he added that the hundred days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The execution of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake, he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to about 9%” of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed support for measures already passed to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He said he agreed with deficit and debt reduction targets, as well as counter-slurge, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of 8,000 million euros necessary without a written guarantee of the support of all parties for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to collaborate to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society is denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to that effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in a way that allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent Economist Intelligence Unit survey that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in the tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
Whether or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or who have not consented.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie said.
Canadians, favorable to euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is coming to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that proceedings should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have been legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life assistance without fear of dealing with a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to collaborate to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered as euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the patients in the terminal phase.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help in suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" regarding the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, questions especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming more isolated
The partisans of Bashar El Asad demonstrated yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bashar El Assad was intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar El Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the Syrian-neighboring king of Jordan said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will depart," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with respect to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "reinforcement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, like Turkey, are taking an increasingly tougher tone” regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces in the Deraa region of southern Syria have already lost their lives, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend the damask from his duties, which in his opinion is “a dangerous step.”
Syria "will not falter," he added, ensuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently considering a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s crackdown, which, in his view, is locked up in “paranoia.”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat is scheduled to be held to develop the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which foresees, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday tried the Arab League’s decision “incorrect,” while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks markets and sacrifices for time for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time to the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated the political parties yesterday and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the abundant small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the forcemen yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that he is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it."
His appointment by the President initially welcomed the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he holds the position, he will work with the urgency and with the aim of making Italy "regain its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budget balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigor.
The "head of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not respect the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big question will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, since Italy has to place about 200,000 million euros in state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Afterwards, it is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, statistics published by the FBI on Monday indicate.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again," human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a head of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include improved police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and is more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes their service look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another called "name" allow you to follow more readably and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") is still on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows to know if they follow messages, if they are paid to new accounts, if they describe as favorite any message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi to a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook
On the network, users have debated at the stroke of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it’s too similar to Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter flow,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budget "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the social democratic/Christian democratic grand coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and, thus, avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign note of Austria by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3,000 million euros more in interest each year," said Christian Democratic Deputy Foreign Affairs Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional States, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again step in the mark of the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that excessive volatility occurs" in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near-highs of all-time highs that produced Japanese authorities’ intervention on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually going back since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has been traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that the increase in the yen from the root of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the right measures,” implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47,000 million euros), bringing to the 55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros) the threshold of the funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area’s stability, European stocks sink a little deeper into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses in Frankfurt by 0.4% and in London by 0.1%.
"Given the new tensions regarding the returns on loans from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing market investor concerns relative to Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and the exchanges will continue to be made in a reduced margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The recurrence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth US$1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that foresees, in particular, the option of a struggling country leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian 10-year obligations reached 6.85%, while Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has affirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain, has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for the euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has registered economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a more favorable figure than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed with short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion will only be useful if it studies all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously will have to be alleviated, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
That is not the case in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of an interrupted power plant after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will represent an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
It must be meditated on the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which he obtains 30% of his electricity, is also one of the great users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to that type of energy, according to the polls.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-relocationable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of the 6,000 million euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no devilish source.
Areva’s development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electric actors who want to build a power plant, the disruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them a free path to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights country" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely economically analysed.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a bit of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was fixed by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not take charge of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and right shared fears of the invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the latest knowledge of immigration (How Mission Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic and skilled workers in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks an anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows represents a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute contributes to idea creation and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at an age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the points of growth that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of the powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving forward in a good way.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows, but a common exercise, in full, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is folded under the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make ourselves European.
"Contactless" chip cards are widespread
The world chip card show kicks off on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an upbeat atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global microprocessor card sales (bank cards, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases by simply bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for the banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks try mobile phone payment
But it only constitutes a first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable for transacting.
"They're lagging behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also affirmed yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which were long suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has certainty."
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,” he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Raptured in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, is since then pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group a community of ill-enlightened ill-deeding interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for Sharia, while its militants are launched in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are first of all oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks against the police stations multiplied.
Abuja’s reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandons its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, particularly against the police’s protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, disturbs all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidency Candidates
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-weakened America, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think they are.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel, are spread.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the “Grand Old Party” nomination, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate who possesses a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “overwhelms” emotions.
He has called for a strong, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I go elected, I will stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing with his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of Iraq’s “boys” and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population rather positively judges Obama’s national security balance, which ended with bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that we need to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and her counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned the valve flyer that controls the Russian gas inflow into the Western European network together.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km that connects the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012 which will allow a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, that is, sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work features victory airs.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close it access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to make its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves triumph.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which the large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect against ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project gave up on the project to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to settle permanently at sea off its coast.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that there will be a leak, since they have foreseen joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot, carried by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it supplies accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the stakes.
To her, the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favourable.
Afterwards, Gazprom rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” Jens Müller says.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
He has an air of adventure, hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the current-looking Moleskine notebooks were born in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far from it has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-spirited and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops of the center of the cities, and has managed to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Daunting?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still much to be done."
It should be mentioned that the unemployed are still facing numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that “constitute the crux of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectually deficient".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishment "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 workers have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that we could see collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s gesture of rancor against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", he has justified himself.
"At Lille, I'm all year, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to stand."
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not forgetting the "pleasure."
He has been cheering on the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
Undoubtedly, that will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially since he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Simply put, Leekens has made reference to the "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala match".
"Pride" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "is again a very high level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be happy to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"They can see him in the next games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal face a great optimism for the second-and-match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes go by, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way (0-0) game, on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it the peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the bright Estadio de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally excited, even if it is clear that the party "is very even", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home," Bento said.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a high individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, provided this time, is realistic.
