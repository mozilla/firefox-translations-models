Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for 1.4 million dollars will be received, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, selected him from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth US president to receive it, although the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will speak about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid such a topic, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts were further increased by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics fail to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million CZK).
She intends to donate them for charitable purposes, but hasn&#39;t yet decided which organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the prime minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not fully deserving it.
Likewise, he repeated several times that the award is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents &quot;a challenge to take action.&quot;
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders) with blackmail.
Last year, it appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals it demanded money from investors for its own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno is not too fond of bins for separating rubbish
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of South Moravia you can find waste-separating containers everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is completely behind in the separation of garbage, not only due to the fact that we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all due to the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle into the right container downtown?
It is almost impossible, above all it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is on Moravské náměstí square, opposite Potrefená Huse.
Don&#39;t let Mr. Onderka and his comrades be angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the rubbish either.
That is why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
for laziness
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I&#39;m not surprised.
I myself offered myself, after a party, to throw away various glass and plastic bottles.
But in Kaunicova Street I didn&#39;t see any red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It&#39;s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn&#39;t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy extra league hockey from the city, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer to separate other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a bit, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The &quot;Paroubek&quot; budget took money from rents and health benefits
After the left, despite the government&#39;s opinion, adds funds for farmers or civil servants, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, health benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow later for sensitive expenses, income, or sickness benefits. &quot;That&#39;s just putting the problems off for the future, it&#39;s laying mines,&quot; says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay it back.
The State does not have many options to get money.
If you don&#39;t reduce social benefits or state operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
To everyone the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also to their children.
People don&#39;t have to worry about annuities or sickness benefits, they will receive them. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year the treasury will not only lack 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The State will need money to cover them and it will no longer come by slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity benefits, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money to the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion left to finish the construction of highways and railways.
It is, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The most that can be done is to keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is majority owned by the state, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never certain nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year from ČEZ they allocated 18,000 million to the budget.
Each year of the dividends, ecological damages are liquidated, they serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Furthermore, with this trick, according to EU rules, you increase the true budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion was obtained from the budget to award various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including in construction savings.
It is not clear if the State will need these funds.
It&#39;s a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, dip into the government&#39;s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the Státní pokladna (State Fund) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow you to monitor online what the different authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will follow, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between various operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With the press of a key, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This possibility is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which concentrates above all on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be released in the year 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and US operators to test virtualization of smartphones, and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only ski lift maintainers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year&#39;s Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas will be snow or mud,&quot; said the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year&#39;s Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations should not hesitate any longer to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays for New Year&#39;s Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but will soon relent and offer shorter stays.
And then the vacant rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That&#39;s why we&#39;ve already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,&quot; said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year&#39;s Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is affected by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be sold out as well,&quot; says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms in the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We&#39;re about five percent better.
For New Year&#39;s Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well,&quot; reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year&#39;s Eve stays are already booked at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, since we are at approximately 60% of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of the Omnia hotel.
For now, though, it looks like Krkonoše hoteliers will get over the craving for snow by waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures should drop and, if there is precipitation, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský from Hradec Králové of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, like a diligent student repeats on the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took to be the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of Bush&#39;s Iraq script, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase &quot;same as in Iraq&quot; used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush&#39;s January 2007 statement for his own statement: &quot;A New Way Forward.&quot;
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush&#39;s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war. And that criticized it as &quot;an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.&quot;
The following months, however, showed that Bush&#39;s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, to such an extent that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush&#39;s reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor with a much more favorable starting position than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subservient relationships, subjected the indecisive riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president wavered for three months, but he couldn&#39;t come up with anything better, so he at least fooled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years. All of Obama&#39;s doctrine raised more questions than it offered answers.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is kept.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing their commander every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. After him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated by confusing relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even setting a state that is &quot;actionable,&quot; a minimal goal of the entire operation, doesn&#39;t seem very real.
The horizon of Obama&#39;s strategy is shocking due to its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to &quot;come home soon&quot; will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect statement of US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what relationship the security of Germany or Italy has with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have a difficult decision to make: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only bright spot for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away and therefore there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this one turns out to be a complete failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold for a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road it has to take, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, 20,000 million dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax bonuses for bankers in excess of 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) at one time, with a fifty percent tax.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year&#39;s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and in literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden today in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This prize was received today by the scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million SEK (approximately 25 million CZK).
In the case of having several winners in each category, the prize is divided between them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, that of Peace, was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that is participating in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering whether to remain in government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved by the chamber on Wednesday of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota&#39;s cabinet tenure as well, is supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
The president&#39;s spokesman Radim Ochvat reported on the appointment.
On his permanence in the function, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left for the transfer of funds and increased money for the salaries of civil servants, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a serious internal political conflict arose. Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer&#39;s bureaucratic cabinet, the shape of which was agreed upon in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics affirm that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of cost-saving measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting &quot;the serious problem&quot; for a long time, that is, &quot;the unsustainable deficit&quot; of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted, calling similar words &quot;strong sentences&quot;.
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by Topolánek&#39;s former government. It will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular ones were also happy.
Mandela in the new movie by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story talks about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in Eastwood&#39;s film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, &quot;When I interpret for you, I&#39;ll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood&#39;s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up as a slave, of the fictional President of the USA, and even from God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, he is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in the year 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby union team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the outsiders to a world extent.
The South African team manages to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela&#39;s story into theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, go backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandela&#39;s hand.
I discovered that by squeezing your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It&#39;s important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby union.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: &quot;In the film I look much taller.&quot;
Despite the obvious differences between the actors&#39; characters and their real models, and under director Eastwood&#39;s management, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and talk of Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: &quot;It was a very good story, a very well made movie.&quot;
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The &quot;Bulava&quot;-type missile, once meant to be the pride of the Russian military, is becoming the bane of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, either did not fly or failed in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write about &quot;Bulava&quot; as &quot;a missile that does not fly&quot;.
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the device.
The engine probably blew up in the third stage of the missile.
This time &quot;Bulava&quot; was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed &quot;Bulavá&quot;.
The Norwegians also from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of failure.
The first two stages of the missile held, and the failure occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines failed immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches was completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense, only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and for this reason they continue to affirm that &quot;Bulavá&quot; will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will reappear at the age of 51 for a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play in Friday&#39;s KHL matchup against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and has promised to help the team.
We just have to settle some formal matters, quoted the AP agency as saying Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear if the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, tallying 15 goals and 26 assists.
The eldest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai complied with the unions&#39; requirements. Will cancel all extra work
The management of the car plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions on one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, since it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, work will be done in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees who work the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way of motivating its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive travel and meal money.
As the overtime work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime work for the month of December. Vaněk mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours on top of eight-hour shifts, and this situation continued almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and the document is signed, they are ready to cancel the emergency strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over the frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements to supply the cars.
The unionists, in their declaration of the emergency due to strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as additional work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production began last November.
Until last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective even on &#39;calloused&#39; HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective on a common variant of the virus as some already available drugs.
AIDS disease cannot be cured so far.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarbonanes have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbonanes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is unlike any drug used today, and thus may solve the problem of resistance.
In their work the scientists find new, &#39;improved&#39; compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to virus albumin.
Metallocarbonanes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, cleavage of the HIV virus does not occur and mature and infectious virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient&#39;s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarbonanes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, where the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metallocarbonanes interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína. Řezáčová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and of the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight over the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he fights back
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is &quot;appalling&quot; and Prime Minister Jan Fischer&#39;s government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and Social Democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the ODS proposals, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the government&#39;s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
disappointment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and the feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amending proposals are approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out that he is thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas the ČSSD nominees, who imposed the budget changes, have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly if he will resign if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those referring to sickness allowances, annuities, or the service law amendment.
Topolánek: ODS-nominated ministers are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS-nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the beginning of the fight with the height of the public finances deficit, &quot;it is absolutely logical and correct, that he should rely on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies&quot;.
However, in this way he will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I haven&#39;t thought about it, when it&#39;s time, I&#39;ll deal with it, defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by ODS members, told reporters in the chamber of deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer left for a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS relented at the request of the prime minister
Nečas underlined, that ODS on Wednesday in the chamber of deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the ODS deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in the parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn&#39;t realize my vote was missing.
When resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it would be a question above all of the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line they will add a pendolino highway.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer run to Bratislava.
Fewer fast trains will run on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line will also be cancelled, and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will only be reduced to some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the outskirts of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will terminate at Praga Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
As of December 13, travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava on the Pendolino.
The bill for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive four billion crowns in total next year, the same as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local dráhy trains they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made for one-day tickets - ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from SEK 450 to SEK 600.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino gunmen continue to detain more than 50 people, the children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped today in the southern Philippines 75 people, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the Agusan del Sur province.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People&#39;s Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers due to the violence, the cause of which was the settlement of scores between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, martial law was imposed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor&#39;s elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, they on Tuesday renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA story concerns the whole world, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood, Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will be released in US theaters.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, who was cast in the lead role years ago by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
high hopes, since it comes to the public at the time when preparations for the world championship in football are culminating in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against casting the leading roles by &quot;uninteresting&quot; Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it&#39;s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela&#39;s character and message.
It is a story from the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first electoral presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also dons the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup back then.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in the RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won standing ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship may help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only &quot;black&quot; on the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, said in an interview recently for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in Lounsko
In the morning, the fire caught a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the Ústí region fire brigade, the fire is being extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their mind and are extinguishing the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company spokeswoman, the failure does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is put out.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
Nothing similar happened during the ten years of Čeps&#39; activity, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the ČEZ company spokesperson for the Northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the electrical substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or businesses.
As Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the 4,339-kilometer-long electrical conduction.
Jančura will file a slander complaint against three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will today file a complaint for slander against three Social Democratic hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company&#39;s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are &quot;taking the cake from the cake&quot;, however we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices for České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander against the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at once having tests from all regions. According to him they have not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek regards this complaint as the continuation of Mr. Jančura&#39;s media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans to do the same.
I suppose, that this time too it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr. Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of about 150 billion crowns they did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don&#39;t quit, we may lose the bus licences.
He introduced himself as a ČSSD deputy, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions are already appearing that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for the vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
the new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
Starting in January, children born after August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not having received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily stopped vaccinating their children against pneumococci.
The parents, however, paid for a dose 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccinations.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state spent for all vaccination of children approximately 500 thousand annually.
Covered vaccination was pioneered by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
From pneumococcal infections in our country every year, according to hospital investigations, 28 children no older than 10 years of age die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the covered pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time opinions appear, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
Mandatory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association, for example.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It&#39;s not entirely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary Vaccine Has Its Downsides, Doctors Say
The president of the pediatric society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, one can reason about reducing the number of doses. &quot;In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination on a voluntary basis,&quot; says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children it is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, in order to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and given out to doctors, just like other vaccines are given by the state.
Some deputies, however, were afraid that insurance companies could &quot;take money out of health insurance&quot;.
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved &quot;in the robbery of a museum&quot;
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal US$20 million (£12 million) worth of paintings from his father&#39;s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings onto his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unnamed police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him &quot;to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a storage room.&quot;
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labor party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, facing criticism from the opposition, business and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling &quot;wasted&quot; an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister has also been heavily criticized for hurting low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements starting in 2011.
Anger at Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future &quot;trouble&quot;.
The increase in Social Security spending, which is set to grow by around £3bn a year, has infuriated the business community, which claims this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS FROM THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, starting in April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers&#39; bonuses
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and a person earning £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved &quot;difficult decisions&quot; but insisted that 60% of the burden of supplementary taxes would fall on the top 5% of wages.
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a &quot;mole grain in the desert&quot; compared to what was needed.
&quot;These are big numbers. It will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth towards the end of the year.
However, Labor Party forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence how much to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy was likely to contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £3bn above previously. My dear.
&quot;Wasted Opportunity&quot;
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign on Thursday warning of Labor&#39;s &quot;debt crisis&quot;, said projected borrowing of £789bn over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan for how they would repay the money, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; dodging difficult choices until after elections due in June 2010.
&quot;They have not included anything significant about what they will do,&quot; said Finance Ministry Shadow Minister Philip Hammond. &quot;They had the chance to do it and they&#39;ve wasted it.&quot;
&quot;All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins&quot;
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labor party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Lib Dems claimed the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year&#39;s spending, not reduce the deficit, arguing the projects were like &quot;sandcastles.&quot;
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the rise in inflation of some disability benefits next April, mentioned above, would leave the Chancellor of the Exchequer open to accusations of maneuvering. elections, since the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labor party insists that it is being provided to the people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
&quot;Fake Budget&quot;
Although the ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the tightening in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister&#39;s figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence, in the future.
&quot;This is really putting the pain off for later,&quot; said its director, Robert Chote.
&quot;All the big announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,&quot; added Roger Bootle, an economics consultant to Deloitte accountants.
&quot;This has been the false pre-budget report. The markets are picking up on this.&quot;
FBI Inquiring into &#39;Arrests of Americans in Pakistan&#39;
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
Pakistan&#39;s US embassy told the BBC the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US Foreign Office said it was also seeking information on the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
&quot;If they&#39;re US citizens, of course we&#39;re going to be very interested in what charges they&#39;ve been held on and under what kind of circumstances they&#39;re being held,&quot; spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
&quot;We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained at a house belonging to the uncle of one of the men.
He said that the house was already in the crosshairs of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported; But he said the US had to &quot;work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.&quot;
The families of the five students reported them missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian &quot;abuses&quot;
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as poor, according to a report by campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details &quot;patterns of abuse&quot; by the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said they threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC&#39;s Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
&quot;false confession&quot;
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of &quot;working with Facebook networks&quot; and protesting against the election result.
&quot;I often get hit in the face&quot; in his words.
&quot;They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.&quot;
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials have denied the rape allegations, but have admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government&#39;s response, but said the bodies&#39; mandate and powers were unclear and the parliamentary committee&#39;s findings had not been made public. .
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The Track in the Park event drew 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100 meter long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the trail, but it was pretty scary.
Below is a beautiful view of the twinkling city lights.
Some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county are here, real talent.&quot;
Prizes were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on building minarets and there is widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author&#39;s latest work &quot;Why the French Don&#39;t Like Headcarves&quot; (2006), an elegant and carefully argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen&#39;s latest book takes a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France&#39;s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces&quot;.
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between professors and students on the questions that matter most to them.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he maintains, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim academic and scholar.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to spread this argument fully.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts, adherents of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe&#39;s Muslims.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires trade-offs.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives &quot;an adjustment of values&quot;.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say &quot;Yes, but not yet.&quot;
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In &quot;On Thin Ice&quot; Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Knowledgeable of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who showed their courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson&#39;s encounter as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, fighting with only the butt of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The pups, captured while swimming following the bodies of their recently exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth the area of a wild adult&#39;s range. The weather is hardly ever right: A Singaporean resident polar bear turned green from algae growing within the hairless patches of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, often returning to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, &quot;After the Ice,&quot; Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist staff writer, offers a chillingly clear account of Arctic science and a compelling look at how the future may be transformed. from that place.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
It is not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen&#39;s pioneering voyages at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century gave clues for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then Cold War submarines mapped the shifting ice ridges that circle beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped out in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson peers into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of trickles of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders within, they&#39;re all doomed once the summer ice recedes, which is thought to be sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... this could be us
Marines among 6,000 laying wreaths at Arlington graves
Pfc. De&#39;Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, NC, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate grave sites, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, where they&#39;re shipping us from, this could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it&#39;s us, I&#39;d want someone to do the same for me, so I&#39;m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterans&#39; graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way to officiate at events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at grave sites in Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, grave sites at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It&#39;s like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed for older graves from World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War because they don&#39;t get as many visitors as newer graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyous as children played and couples held hands as they carried fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are entombed, went virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars pervaded the area.
People openly wept, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the frigid air.
Some read names carved into the stones aloud, while others leaned forward to see small black and white plaques set into the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers wiping tears from her eyes in front of her son&#39;s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
&quot;Long after I&#39;m dead I want someone to remember it.&quot;
Cuban officers arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a US government contractor distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the US Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed &quot;dangerous.&quot;
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but permission has been denied.
The arrest of a US contractor is likely to spark tensions between the Castro brothers&#39; communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a &quot;slow pace&quot; approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times first broke the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary for a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cell phones this year only; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the US Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of US citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly ill-advised.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as handing out free cell phones, is a crime in Cuba, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, dubbed &quot;New Castro, same Cuba,&quot; a reference to Raúl Castro&#39;s appointment as the country&#39;s leader, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and jailed in one day.
He said that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they hope the case could help untangle a sprawling network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering one of them had made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan&#39;s tribal belt, which is a familiar location for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terror network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered part of a sting operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were unfazed and were even trying to get proper approval to enter al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who they can trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made trying to infiltrate people into al Qaeda a top priority.
The organization&#39;s recruiters act as gatekeepers, not letting through those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda closely scrutinizes would-be American recruits.
But for the organization they are enormously attractive, because of their potential to gain access to US targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also grown much more cautious in recent years about who they admit because US intelligence agencies have become adept at their methods. recruitment.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlman said.
It has morphed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Demand Climate &#39;Action&#39;
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here demanding bolder climate action from negotiators working at the city&#39;s Bella Center Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists planted small explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English that read &quot;There is no planet B&quot; and one in Spanish that declared, &quot;Earth says &quot;stop&quot;.
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said her trips to her mother&#39;s native Peru made her aware of the harrowing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of the climatic changes that are already happening. &quot;
This is part of the reason I have decided to join the big rally, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding deal, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way around it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be named because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits planted several explosives near Copenhagen&#39;s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as blazes but were followed by &quot;a couple of big explosions.&quot;
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China&#39;s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, &quot;I wasn&#39;t really aware of the situation.&quot;
He then went on to say in Mandarin, &quot;As the meeting place is big, I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside.&quot;
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define if the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, &quot;it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week&#39;s federal report card on math performance was very good news for Capital District public schools.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the report card showed that fourth- and eighth-graders have made strides at a faster pace over the past two years than Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains etched in the recent numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white DC fourth-graders over the past two years have grown from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Progress for African Americans in eighth grade remained essentially flat, down a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a span of six years, the picture is no brighter.
The difference that separated white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only narrowed to 58.
Some education attorneys in the District expressed concern last week that the advances celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the mix by serving those at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and contentious, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District. .
I&#39;m not jumping for joy over a two- or three-point difference, said DC Council Member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-At-Join), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a vocal critic of Rhee&#39;s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city&#39;s high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what is concerning is that we are not devoting the necessary time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered the fundamentals of early reading in their classes. school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a kindergarten through sixth grade mathematics curriculum emphasizing games and real life experiences, which was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to provide the best interventions for those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources to low-performing schools that will be needed to close the gap.
There&#39;s something of a tricky dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to direct its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of DC
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now the superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element of closing the achievement gap is lengthening the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
You have to get to almost 200 days to have the force of the change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers&#39; union last year on a 185-day year, which she sees as an &quot;indicator&quot; to seek a larger increase. in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a heavy wheeze.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, got out and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades, and emerald lawns.
Graciela&#39;s parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than of enthusiastic potential students.
Yeah! This is where I&#39;ll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Geez, really? he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school&#39;s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the boys had visited on their three-day trip, and by now they had fully absorbed its deliberate message: The question isn&#39;t whether you&#39;re going to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these &quot;second generation&quot; Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, primarily Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories matter, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the nation&#39;s workforce.
Those who analyze top achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents don&#39;t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time isn&#39;t going to fix it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis. , who has tested Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed Graciela&#39;s college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college-preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq&#39;s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
US companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one that submitted a bid lost.
Two US companies reached deals for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the US oil giants at the opening of Iraq&#39;s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans are taking the lead, said Ruba Husari, a staff writer for the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombing strikes on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military withdraws, likely prevented US oil companies from taking more aggressive risks in Iraq, which has the world&#39;s third-largest oil reserves. the analysts stated.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only US companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
Major US firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
China&#39;s state-owned National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and landed large contract investments for two major fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will keep up with its competitors and meet its commitments towards Iraq.
Companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then matched against the subsidy per barrel the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda&#39;s top planner has apparently been assassinated in Pakistan
A suspected US missile attack on Pakistan&#39;s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, US counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials. region of.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan&#39;s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official with Pakistan&#39;s civilian intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the &quot;totally mangled bodies.&quot;
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior military planner for al Qaeda, who led the terror group&#39;s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He engaged in plotting around the world, said a senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering his central role, this likely included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda&#39;s higher command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be a familiar name to some Americans, but that in no way lessens the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officials.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization. profit.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability as they ruthlessly murder suspected informants, the site claimed.
Top UN envoy in Kabul about to resign
The United Nations&#39; top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan&#39;s UN-backed presidential election.
Eide&#39;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the surge but is concerned that the US military withdrawal timetable starting in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to pull out their forces.
We have to speed up the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants to help with Afghanistan&#39;s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but merely fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend just two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that they better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between my predecessor&#39;s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide&#39;s position in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country&#39;s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations by Galbraith, who was fired, &quot;certainly hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism regarding international interference&quot; in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who are on loan to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to recruit talent.
So much so that the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Addressing a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier&#39;s question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran&#39;s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the broader Iranian population.
He argued that &quot;a package of incentives and disincentives&quot; would be needed &quot;to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;their people will suffer enormously&quot; from sanctions.
In a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot;credible&quot; consequences if its nuclear program does not fully abide by UN Security Council guidance and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated he would renegotiate on curtailing his nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have backed away from the tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think that Iran&#39;s toughening up with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has brought the international community together, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven&#39;t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including going ahead with what Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;devastating sanctions.&quot;
In a statement made in New York, Iran&#39;s mission to the United Nations on Thursday denounced what it called &quot;unsubstantiated and baseless accusations&quot; by some members of the Security Council about Iran&#39;s nuclear activities, saying that is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, &quot;in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.&quot;
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq&#39;s Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the chairman of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.&quot;
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them that &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to support any more children&quot; and &quot;one more baby means one more grave.&quot;
They learned their lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city&#39;s low birthrate and aging population, suddenly reversed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China&#39;s one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately dubbed &quot;little emperors,&quot; a demographic crisis is brewing in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy took effect, according to the Division
UN Demographic Chart, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent .
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai&#39;s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said fertile couples should have babies to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the population aging and alleviate future labor shortages.&quot;
Shanghai is about to be &quot;as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,&quot; he said.
a gradual relief
Written into the country&#39;s constitution in 1978, China&#39;s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University&#39;s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more sweeping changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the signs ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide flyers under doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been less than overwhelming.
disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, more urban districts indicate no change.
Huinan Township, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only reach around 165,000, slightly up from 2009 but down from 2008.
Feng Juying, head of Shanghai&#39;s Caolu Township Family Planning Committee, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don&#39;t want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple&#39;s first child.
Yes, they are robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political question.
It&#39;s the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was one too: &quot;We were the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don&#39;t want to take care of others. &quot;
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of a translation agency, put it more forcefully.
For middle-class, two-career parents driving down the birth rate, he said, it&#39;s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China&#39;s experiment with capitalism and don&#39;t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parental time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, &quot;they have to remodel their apartment&quot;, and the strategic one &quot;has to have a curriculum prepared for the best nurseries when the child is 9 months old.&quot;
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don&#39;t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to cut emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant stands and mutual recriminations, garnered renewed attention Friday with the release of a document that calls for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders due to arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a range of options for key questions, including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and how far global temperature rises policy makers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, abridged a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN&#39;s top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as &quot;the big picture.&quot;
It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their 2020 emissions by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs over the same period. period between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Still, Friday saw the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations for the past week.
US special climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, versus voluntary cuts by major emerging economies, if not financed by the world. developed.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line on China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without major developing countries stepping up and taking action, Stern said, also lamenting that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top US climate negotiator lacked &quot;common sense&quot; or was &quot;very irresponsible&quot; for saying earlier in the week that the The United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world&#39;s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much to save individual economies as it is to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world&#39;s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing over who should pay the bill to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters. responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being played out, said Ulate, who also works as regional adviser on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even though most major players say the talks will produce at best a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has &quot;put political pressure on the entire political process,&quot; partly because they are now unified and demanding action from the emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government get around to closing a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to narrow down the claims they made. They will be arbitrated during the next week.
The utter disarray of the gathering (where every day 13,000 people stream in and out of the convention center, guitar-playing activists put on late-night shows mocking countries they say are selling out, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand in instead of via email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain&#39;s first 225km/h train redefines that Monday feeling
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country&#39;s first high-speed intercity train will hit 225km/h as it streaks from Ashford, Kent, to London&#39;s St Panrcas station, covering 93km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity Javelin service out of London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected backwaters would be turned into prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from planes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions as well as alleviate congestion on the highways.
In theory, all three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage may still hold back Britain&#39;s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times has learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five meters in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters from a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set up three options for a broader high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It seems that this will be the most beneficial option,” said a member of the railway.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel at 402km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 meters long, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could run every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital&#39;s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision won&#39;t be made until after a general election.
Even if you get the job done, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave the fast lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a shift from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers face Conservative&#39;s £75,000 orange grove mortgage
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built at his constituency house.
The party&#39;s prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot;, increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
Officials in the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members&#39; spending. Last night Mr Duncan said the requests &quot;could not be clearer or simpler&quot;.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described on the plans as an &quot;orange grove.&quot;
Neighbors described it as &quot;a greenhouse for entertainment.&quot;
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase, during a recent House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges inquiry into his previous mortgage deals.
Last month the committee cleared him of breaking the rules, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage on his London property to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their claims increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan&#39;s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase went to finance the £75,000 loan.
The BRE&#39;s standard variable mortgage rate dropped from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is currently at.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still claiming £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as opposition Speaker of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive &quot;on rations&quot; after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like s**t.”
He stated: “I spend my money on my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don&#39;t. &quot;
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wages office that this &quot;could be considered excessive&quot;.
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol in Mr Duncan&#39;s lawn in protest, after it was revealed that he applied for £4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr Duncan said: &quot;It was for major improvements, approved both by the wages office and subsequently by Legg.&quot;
He added: “It&#39;s not about shirking and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within limits, by the rules, authorized and all.
It couldn&#39;t be in any way clearer or simpler.&quot;
Come those who have faith, to see the Brighton beach palapa advent calendar
Brighton&#39;s palapas have found new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
Additionally, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event kicked off on December 1, with guests getting to see the last palapa from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served for free.
Christmas carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Come, Oh Come, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric for the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: &quot;We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.&quot;
&quot;Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea for the Palapa Advent Calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we&#39;re trying to try and represent that through spirituality.&quot;
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police detained several hundred people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital to demand an agreement that the United Nations Conference on climate change must reach no later than Friday. This would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the fact that &quot;the political price&quot; of a failure in Copenhagen is very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the &quot;Black Blocs&quot;, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in last april.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained &quot;without distinction&quot;, stressing that a hundred of them &quot;were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold&quot;.
The rather peaceful demonstration left Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, the venue for the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to accommodate the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the big European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them in light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth&#39;s call to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;justice and climate&quot;.
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue saying: there is time, affirmed the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, streams that you can walk on like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement reached out to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalisation figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to &quot;unite climate justice and social justice&quot;: &quot;today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world&quot;.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of demonstrators were formed, calling for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the &quot;350&quot; network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elects president, though Georgia denounces &quot;fraud&quot;
This Saturday Abkhazia, the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow for more than a year, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces &quot;fraud&quot;.
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian breakaway region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to those responsible for the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, among them the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which failed the vote count.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili &quot;regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation,&quot; said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a pretty white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the progress of the ballot.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow&#39;s support, and most particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia&#39;s independence.
I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of Abkhazian railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Conference on climate change in Copenhagen, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around a massive demonstration.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013 .
The rather peaceful demonstration left Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to accommodate the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened forcefully, knocking several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the &quot;Black Blocs&quot;, ultraviolent small groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was hit in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a squatter house during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We don&#39;t take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters hovered overhead.
The majority of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, from London, from Amsterdam, even from Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them in light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth&#39;s call to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;justice and climate&quot;.
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding action against climate change.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview that will be broadcast on the Sunday News (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would emerge &quot;strengthened&quot; from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first year of high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, &quot;enough with the hypocrisy&quot; because, according to him, &quot;branch C is no longer a scientific branch&quot;, but &quot;in general, it summons the best students&quot;.
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be sub-branches of C, he even continues to underline: &quot;I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in the second year of high school in technological schools.&quot;
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L&#39;Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government project to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in the second year of high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some representatives Right-wing elected officials also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that &quot;there is no talk&quot; of eliminating philosophy from the second year of high school C.
Luc Chatel also defended the teacher training reform, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will sit an admission test that will focus on their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also do internships in real conditions during the M2 year, then they will spend a first year in front of the classroom as trainee teachers.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Lastly, the Minister points out that he is going to propose &quot;the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education&quot;.
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map &quot;before 2012&quot;.
At the Superior Normal School, the experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC), invited by the École Normale Superieure on Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the &quot;Ernest&quot; conference, a day made up of a series of fifteen-minute presentations by experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day, as the students named the fish in the school pond, during the conference.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts in their discipline and we selected them for their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, &quot;we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,&quot; Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public understands that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific file.&quot;
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school&#39;s website beginning December 15.
The next &quot;Ernest&quot; event is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Late Payments: Dissatisfaction Among Prison Guards, Action Planned
Prison guards unions called for a &quot;general mobilization&quot; on Friday to demand payment before the year-end holidays of bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The prison Labor Force (2nd guards union) asked off-duty staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and &quot;block&quot; them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The penitentiary CGT (3rd union of the profession) summons them to &quot;meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization&quot;, as it calls &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot; the non-payment in December of &quot;extra hours, premiums nights, Sundays and holidays&quot; worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), &quot;calls for a general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury.&quot;
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all of them were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures so that this situation generated by a bad evaluation of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
December&#39;s pay will then be low, except for management personnel who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who &quot;always blame budgetary demands&quot;, deplored Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice &quot;all meetings and convocations&quot;.
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the moment when we increase the tasks and missions without taking more troops, it is more than lamentable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the Bordeaux prison CGT.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, affirmed the general secretary of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he gives &#39;better gifts&#39; than the ones he receives
The US president, Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, that he reached a simple conclusion regarding gifts: &quot;I give better gifts than the ones I receive &quot;.
During a special interview to be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at their prestigious new residence.
Even Bo, the family&#39;s little four-legged companion, will be part of the game.
Santa loves Bo too, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will &quot;of course&quot; receive a gift, according to pre-aired excerpts from the show.
And Michelle Obama took issue with her husband&#39;s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: &quot;No way, I gave you nice gifts last year,&quot; she said, taunting the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously replying, pointing to the First Lady&#39;s pearl necklace, &quot;Who gave you that?&quot;
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama&#39;s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the President.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, instead of arranging it around the hearth, but I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL affirms that he is in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday underwent surgery again in Los Angeles due to significant &quot;injuries&quot; derived from an operation in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his relatives, while RTL affirms that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications .
The 66-year-old rocker underwent surgery again on the night of Wednesday through Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where some doctors verified &quot;injuries derived from the operation&quot; of a herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service said. in that same city, indicating that said injuries &quot;needed a repair operation&quot;.
However, the singer&#39;s press service tried to convey peace of mind by stating that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;, and reported that a new medical report would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer&#39;s last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid &quot;pain and complications.&quot;
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also affirms that &quot;according to some sources&quot; no cannula would have been inserted after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the Parc Monceau international clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through &quot;a bad time&quot;, but assured that there was &quot;no problem&quot; because the rocker is &quot;a fighter&quot;.
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was foolish to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it&#39;s not possible, declared Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician&#39;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure, stating that Johnny Hallyday &quot;reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was &quot;controlled.&quot;
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the musician&#39;s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer&#39;s health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for &quot;colon cancer&quot; after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long &quot;66 Tour&quot;, presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been hyped up. Fans and journalists noted the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short course: Bousquet&#39;s first title in his favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist in the 2009 World Cups in the long course, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in the 50m freestyle, a mark he holds in the long course (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20&#39;&#39;53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at an international level.
Bousquet was ahead of the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be prohibited from January 1.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long course this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I did not give myself fully in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby&#39;s art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble &quot;representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since there are only four or five in the world,&quot; Florent Heintz, vice president, told AFP on Tuesday. of ancient Roman and Egyptian art auctions at Sotheby&#39;s.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is continuing, but so far this lot has been the most bid by buyers, hands down, a Sotheby&#39;s spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then it appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an &quot;Emile Zola succession&quot; opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and the fresco of the &quot;Rougon- Macquart&quot;.
Honduras aborted Zelaya&#39;s departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not right to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya away returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migrations.
In order to grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and request political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as the invited acting Head of State.
The coup government &quot;suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation,&quot; Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that He has been in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president playing a few chords, a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told the Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask any country for asylum, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview on the Telesur network, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya&#39;s departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who rallied around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government compared to international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela&#39;s socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must answer to justice for the crime of &quot;high treason&quot;, according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial ballot, Porfirio Lobo was elected. Said election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted en masse against Zelaya&#39;s return to power until his term expires on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher this Thursday, the figures for the US trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated &quot;in the glass half full.&quot;
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, &quot;which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.&quot;
The trade deficit of the United States fell 7.6% in October in relation to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants &quot;was the lowest it&#39;s been a year,&quot; said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% versus 3.423% late Tuesday, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% versus 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power boo the &quot;Ladies in White&quot;
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of Raúl Castro&#39;s government while they were walking towards the center of the capital demanding the release of said detainees, said an AFP journalist.
Death to the Yankees! &quot;Mercenaries!&quot; &quot;The street belongs to the revolutionaries!&quot; &quot;Long live Fidel and Raúl!&quot; the militants of power chanted the dissidents with their fists raised.
The latter were escorted by agents in civilian clothes who came to &quot;protect&quot; them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the dissidents into the vehicles who were booed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to &quot;request the release of all political prisoners&quot;, some 200 according to the dissidence, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents jailed in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities label the opponents as &quot;mercenaries&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
A very rare event in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday&#39;s demonstration by government militants against the &quot;counterrevolutionaries.&quot;
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A madman murders an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Thursday afternoon at rush hour
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant hit an elderly man with two knives, for reasons not yet determined, in or in front of the pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources reported. and witnesses.
As a result of serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an official from the Alliance police union.
Later, in or in front of the pharmacy, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded man, with his vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was admitted &quot;in shock,&quot; a police source said.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped along the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently randomly, he would have seriously injured two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and a forty-year-old man seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried across his back, an official from the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, explained at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated man, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn&#39;t make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at number 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the armed man and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was an injured man in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of approximately 35 years of age arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Hauts-de-Seine Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of admitting him to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was &quot;in a state of overexcitement&quot; like &quot;everyone deranged of this type whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action.&quot;
USA: Polanski&#39;s lawyer asks again to dismiss the case
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse happened more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of &quot;El Pianista&quot;, denounced serious procedural errors before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I am calling for the charges to be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, &quot;was chilling.&quot;
According to him, Judge Rittenband (since deceased) spoke with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious misconduct.
This conversation was made public in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot; (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September &quot;having lied&quot; to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for the holding of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argumentation made at first instance, that is, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for &quot;illegal sexual relations&quot; with a minor under 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski &quot;has to be here to appear at the hearing.&quot;
With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility to flee? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker &quot;asks the court for a favor, although he despises its authority.&quot;
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed &quot;that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.&quot;
Hummel was not the only one calling for the dismissal of the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, to close the case.
He maintains that his client can no longer stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: &quot;No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that&#39;s enough.&quot;
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, pending eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and slows down due to the rise in the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is torn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0, 03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with a technological component, lost 0.55 points to settle at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with tight spreads, the volume of trades is getting smaller and I think it will stay that way until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which &quot;helped to improve the market&#39;s opinion regarding the strength of the economic recovery,&quot; summarized the analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence rebounded visibly in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar, which reached its highest level in the last two months against the euro, which &quot;takes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,&quot; explained Owen Fitzpatrick, from Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.540% from 3.482% late Wednesday, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This contest, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 p.m. (3:00 p.m. GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the chance to rediscover &quot;breathtaking African landscapes&quot;.
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates concentrate on the pageant.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Every woman&#39;s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it&#39;s not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa has shown itself capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous Soweto township, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Uncommon for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I would meet.
She will probably return for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive,&quot; said his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local time (9:00 p.m. GMT).
The singer&#39;s son, relaxed, assured that he would go &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection derived from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician has been &quot;in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment,&quot; the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to an induced coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday due to an infection, the sequel to a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer underwent surgery once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous operation.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade attends, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Parc Monceau international private clinic in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus maintained that Johnny Hallyday had &quot;traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.&quot;
I spoke directly with the doctor and he surprised me when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I was operated on twice for herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently &quot;left without a cannula, with nothing&quot;, after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a bruise formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being &quot;an unscrupulous man&quot; sued &quot;regularly&quot; before the Council of the Order, and it is &quot;far from being recommended&quot;.
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention &quot;was carried out without any inconvenience&quot; and that the results of the postoperative studies were &quot;normal&quot;.
The operation &quot;could not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage,&quot; he added.
In any case, the singer&#39;s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a hiatus.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned seems very risky to me, declared Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by François Bayrou&#39;s MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted this Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, intimidating him to withdraw it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, since he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had expected to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou&#39;s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy, intimidating them to renounce the acronym and transfer the trademark property rights, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem , as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement&#39;s name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l&#39;UDF d&#39;aujourd&#39;hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As they already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office, which demands that the NC remove &quot;immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all supports, as well as from (its) Internet site&quot;.
It also asks Hervé de Charette &quot;to transfer the ownership of (the) brand to the legitimate rightful holders&quot;.
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF &quot;has been a true political movement since 1978&quot; and recall that Morin and his friends &quot;chose&quot; to leave in 2007 &quot;to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP.&quot; .
Therefore, the New Center does not have, according to them, any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending &quot;the material and moral interests&quot; of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, &quot;when he registered the mark&quot;, he was no longer &quot;a member of the UDF for three years&quot;, but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, they take advantage of the lack of registration of the UDF acronym to do it on their own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC&#39;s strategy: &quot;We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make one&#39;s own name than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that You don&#39;t have the right.&quot;
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt affirms, he took advantage of the octogenarian&#39;s state of weakness to plunder part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of entertainment stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros. .
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L&#39;Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Court also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L&#39;Oréal always refused to submit to such tests, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must deliver a report before March 10, 2010 in which they must state if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he will accept.
I&#39;m going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court&#39;s decision.
This is excellent news (…) The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother&#39;s weakness for years to obtain one billion euros in donations, through checks, contracts of life insurance or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the merits of the action filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers&#39; arguments resulted, on some occasions, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said that she mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: &quot;I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again.&quot;
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open proceedings legal guardianship for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt &quot;has full capacity to appear in court, is not under guardianship and does not have a guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place,&quot; said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule after the trial on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees is reminiscent of the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to certain &quot;values&quot; From above, as before, it was a matter of imposing products designed by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies to conquer markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to customer preference factors is repeat regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company&#39;s intellectual functions, especially R&amp;D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) &quot;requires that all parties involved (...) have a proactive behavior and a prospective vision&quot;; This requires a commitment from the employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting collaborators at the center of the company&#39;s concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls are relatively useful
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, spur a managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many turns, all companies essentially end up doing... what they always did! B989
-Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
Coming from the great schools of engineering, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that the American &quot;neurosciences&quot; recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the &quot;commands&quot; (sic) of executive commitment, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management position, unsuitable for today&#39;s world. .
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, supposes adopting a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilizing factors, company managers can control, forecast and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and relocate human resource management &quot;in place&quot;.
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: For &#39;just war&#39; Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner has defended the concept of &quot;just war&quot; against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama&#39;s award ceremony on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I loved what he said, Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the Republican right wing told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the subject of &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is certainly the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush&#39;s two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done &quot;a very good job&quot; in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives was pleased, who appreciated in particular the mention of &quot;the existence of evil in the world&quot; in the presidential remarks.
At times, I found the speech very historic, Gingrich said during an interview on &quot;The Takeaway&quot; radio show.
The former representative-elect, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration in the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear &quot;a president of the left&quot; when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee &quot;that they would not be free nor could award a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist&quot;.
According to Michael Gerson, author of the George W. Bush speeches and current columnist for the Washington Post, Obama delivered &quot;a very American speech.&quot;
In addition to presenting himself as a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;, as &quot;he always does&quot;, &quot;he spoke like an American president&quot; when reminding Europeans &quot;that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it&quot;, Gerson stated.
Among the unconvinced few on the right, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech &quot;drab, pretentious and uninspired&quot; on the National Review Online website.
To the president&#39;s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the resort to force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still believing Obama was awarded the Nobel prematurely, called his speech a &quot;blockbuster&quot; especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech &quot;should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,&quot; the Californian newspaper enthused.
Obama &quot;delivered the speech that was necessary,&quot; the New York Times estimated, judging it &quot;both somber and uplifting.&quot;
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers&#39; organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement late in the morning.
Even when three employers&#39; organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to reach an agreement and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict &quot;would have been very detrimental to companies&quot; and &quot;it was feared that it would disrupt the year-end festivities,&quot; Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It&#39;s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there could always be a disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was &quot;a good agreement&quot;, although it was &quot;difficult to grant increases to high salaries considering the international competition&quot;.
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as &quot;a historic agreement&quot;.
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is &quot;an acceptable compromise&quot;.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel expenses and the holding of general assemblies for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will above all make it possible to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that &quot;a drop of 100 million euros in employer charges&quot; was the subject of a government amendment in the rectification finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it &quot;under the same terms.&quot;
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies adhering to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event that the Ministry of Labor makes an extension.
It will be done &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; said Bussereau.
Opposition from employers&#39; organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a &quot;naive business&quot;, since the 100 million euros &quot;had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax&quot;.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an urgent situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to upset those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, lamented the Unostra.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts &quot;the stability of many SMEs in the sector at risk over the next 12 months.&quot;
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train out of two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that &quot;RATP is working hard to serve big box stores.&quot;
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no trains at off-peak hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up &quot;an hour and a half early to arrive on time.&quot;
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided supervision by police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF coming from or bound for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metro.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; according to the unions, of a meeting held with management on Friday afternoon will be discussed.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, pointing out that the management &quot;was not capable of solving a problem that the SNCF and the highway sector had already solved.&quot;
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday to carry out &quot;a more extensive analysis of the conditions for exercising the profession,&quot; the RATP specified.
Which also led unions to say the company &quot;didn&#39;t care about weekend riders.&quot;
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters, in Paris.
Then the management, which until then had refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting &quot;to calm the waters.&quot;
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indépendants have submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, earn from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey&#39;s Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of disbanding the country&#39;s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked outrage in the Kurdish community, in the country&#39;s southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the &quot;focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity,&quot; the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party&#39;s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk They are removed from political life for five years.
Likewise, the judge announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the &quot;principles&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has no &quot;organic links&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court&#39;s verdict intervenes at a time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a disbandment could lead to an escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk affirmed that the decision of justice was going to &quot;deepen the discouragement&quot;.
Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, NDLR) issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party originating from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
On principle we oppose the closure of parties.
Nothing is solved this way, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A really cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something with which you want to make life miserable for citizens, says the director of winter road maintenance at the FES
But with it your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Weather forecasters may announce it for the first time over the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-sections with large vehicles set out with salt, explains Brauburger.
This includes, for example, major thoroughfares and boulevards such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES begins around three in the morning, &quot;with this the roads are free until the rush hour traffic begins.&quot;
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30am.
&quot;Then we have a problem,&quot; says the director of winter road maintenance, &quot;because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt.&quot;
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is given to the side and secondary streets.
That&#39;s where the trouble comes from, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry began to march, mainly the dangerous points and crossroads were cleared.
Usually the FES would not be able to take care of all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. mainly keeps an eye on the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salt vehicle starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In an emergency, the police can also call them.
the cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-tall animal that ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with claws. sickle-shaped and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which then lay in a dry area on the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a dig at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes we have found as many as a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name &quot;Tawa&quot; comes from the Hopi Indian sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: &quot;Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found.&quot;
Other dinosaur experts don&#39;t quite share his enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, about when the saurians divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as &quot;necked long&quot; and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with a bird&#39;s pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues&#39; analysis, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in the Tawa hallae skull, the researchers found evidence of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae also the bones of the vertebral column were evidently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers deduce that saurians first arose there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other not very closely related theropods.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We think there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group to the dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a puzzle.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today&#39;s crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while the relationship died out at the limit of the Triassic to the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact stopped the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, in California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt had repercussions around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the students protesting on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they &quot;reject&quot; the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on education strike evicted last week because the walls and artwork were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, judge the signatories, do not justify &quot;the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police command.&quot;
The eviction represented an &quot;unacceptable attack&quot; on the freedom of inquiry and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to &quot;delegitimize and criminalize the protest&quot; and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
The majority of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
legitimized protest
Also the young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions show solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one&#39;s own future, comments Verdi&#39;s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen&#39;s Science Minister, however, defended the actions of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, he commented in a broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden provincial parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, CDU delegate to the provincial parliament.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has presented a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to present a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow&#39;s ten districts, was a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the community of 216,000, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the &quot;Russian Silicon Valley&quot;.
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have been in contact with the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits took place and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a &quot;Protocol of close collaboration&quot; in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called &quot;Socialist Planning City&quot; for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as &quot;Green City&quot;) received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, on which research facilities were located.
Stuttgart Brakes
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 does not rank high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply &quot;the new heart of Europe&quot;.
The law is S21 is much more than the downsizing of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will plunge the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region into a decade of hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, ending in the middle of the city, were then considered fossils of 19th century engineering, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, as in the past it took an enormous amount of time to hook up the locomotives behind. forward.
Roll, stop dead continue the journey; but that&#39;s how it should be done.
And that is why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a way station, which is located approximately halfway along the route of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan &quot;Heart of Europe&quot;.
The S21 will really be kickstarted, even though the visions of the &#39;80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with a tractor unit and driver&#39;s car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built section ICE to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the great individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer&#39;s computer generated graphics.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The way station and road support are intended for people transport, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
Back then there was no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than road transport by truck.
However, the new sections under construction are not suitable for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zouaves.
That is the official figure.
Experts consider ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other junctions and narrow passages in the network.
In total sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the layout has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government has left pending in the Wiesbaden regional parliament whether it is going to file an appeal against the ruling on the ban on night flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to do legal research into the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date, that in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at the Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., as provided by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, if it is going to present the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to drop the appeal to the nation&#39;s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It&#39;s hard enough if they let you keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the PDF slogan &quot;We keep our word.&quot;
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, that the federal government would still be trying through misrepresentation of the law and tricks to obtain its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a &quot;quick first impression&quot;.
We need a legally impeccable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been the statements of his group about the ban on night air traffic.
US banks return the aid provided.
The big US banks shaken by the crisis are shedding their state ties.
The &quot;Bank of America&quot; returned at once the aid that the Tarp bank bailout fund had provided for a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30,000 million euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC in the United States.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The &quot;Bank of America&quot; had obtained approximately 19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others from the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night especially thanked American taxpayers: the financial injection helped get them through very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank takeover effort at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source in well-known circles that the US bank could announce as early as Thursday the increase in its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative for the Citi group declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid in June.
quick pick
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the union intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF&#39;s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also played a role not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter further, if this proposal was not approved in the administrative council either.
Frey, Schächter&#39;s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 guild members.
The result of the vote had not yet been finalized at the time of writing this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender&#39;s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender&#39;s removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure to be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hessian government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief on the grounds that under Brender&#39;s leadership the ZDF news programs would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was lashed.
In the end, even 35 specialists in public law had meddled in the debate, describing Koch&#39;s actions as unconstitutional.
But it was no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
Later he worked at the station &quot;Südwestfunk&quot; and at the daily &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot;.
In 1983 he switched to the ZDF, initially to the informative &quot;heute-journal&quot;.
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 editor-in-chief personal rapporteur; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 director and host of the morning show &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot;; until 2001 foreign policy director of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the dismissal of Brender, who was chosen again on Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine &quot;Medium Magazin&quot;.
Koch&#39;s opponent on the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director&#39;s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a mostly politically motivated.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the ZDF&#39;s controlling unions was ruled out by Beck.
Brender&#39;s likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board of directors with a smart move: he strongly criticized the union for Brender&#39;s removal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the administrative council was able to vote for him, without being suspected of giving the post to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
College careers clear
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the state ministers of education and culture finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to excel in their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the load of exams: basically each module of the degree must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of the students, and it is wanted to guarantee a &quot;real and justifiable measure&quot;.
The policy and the Universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between the Universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states undertake to make the overall structural rules for Bachelor and Master&#39;s degrees more flexible.
Regulations of the federal states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have continually talked about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a degree (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: &quot;Each module ends with a single exam,&quot; says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
With the &quot;significant reduction of the exam load&quot; it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future &quot;studyability&quot; should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly scrutinized for unnecessary restrictions on students&#39; choice of...
the courses.
Students would have &quot;the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative.&quot;
These rules would be valid for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be &quot;recredited&quot; again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federated states.
The education and culture ministers urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical colleges have already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has claimed to provide additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The federal state and the universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of the university law.
According to her, a single exam should be enough to complete a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to guaranteeing the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year, it is intended to examine all the careers regarding their &quot;studyability.&quot;
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again about the conditions of studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
At the federal level board of directors of the Juso (Young Socialist) university groups, it was demanded that the shaping of educational policy should no longer be carried out &quot;behind the closed doors&quot; of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as the main stakeholders should have a say as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: &quot;We need the experience of the students,&quot; she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the union of education and science (GEW) the agreements of Bonn were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility of acceding to a later Master&#39;s degree.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be enough study places for Masters in the future with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to recruit significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the master&#39;s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
&quot;Going in and out of Germany is done practically without control&quot; says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalancing idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost your language environment.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, then as a reader at a children&#39;s book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several prizes for literature, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lectures in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about &quot;German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files&quot;
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in the year 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had started slowly, beginning in 1971.
&quot;Therefore I am someone who did not sufficiently defend himself against the fear-mongering attempts of the Securitate,&quot; Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania was shaken by a case that evidenced the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as is known so far, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said the literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner&#39;s confession, stressing the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had excused or defended him on all the points that were difficult for him, Markel said.
&quot;I feel the moral need to make this claim,&quot; he said.
Söllner&#39;s statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller in the weekly &quot;Zeit&quot; as early as July, after having read her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the dealing with the files of the control by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and made difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then has been rather slow.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Temesvar Securitate spoke contemptuously of the decorated woman.
&quot;She has psychosis&quot;, in the end they only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself outright in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent blame.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner&#39;s confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the allocation of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the VfB Stuttgart soccer team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team&#39;s supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it was the I had the impression that a smartly dressed member of the foreign service was leaving a very nice Christmas party, at which the sporting-goods manufacturer had given out samples.
The man with the bald head had hired a driver, since he did not know the city yet.
For the rest, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: &quot;It is true that we reached the round of 16&quot;, namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, &quot;but not we can let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation.&quot;
The &quot;much more important task&quot; awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the &quot;royal classes&quot; in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have become clear again, after the quick three goals from Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lottery
The Champions League round of 16 (first legs on February 16/17 and 23/24/second legs on March 9/10 and 16/17) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy at the sudden arrival of Babbel&#39;s successor was kept limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered Stuttgart profis with self-confidence, a willingness to give of themselves and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more forward, the soul repairer Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but with the therapist Babbel it had no longer worked.
He displayed a certain magic, conceded Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, &quot;when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn&#39;t have thought possible.&quot;
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived “phenomenon” with the proverbial “fresh wind” and the way of working of the new boss: “He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.&quot;
And this is what was obviously missing when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart above all needs consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by a lack of relief and completely overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had come, Khedira suggested.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after his first home victory in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had conceded.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism from Lehmann.
He had reproached the board of directors for weakness in management, which had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Also, the fact that his day off after the games had been eliminated was described by Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann&#39;s statements were &quot;marked by sheer egoism,&quot; Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the defender.
They probably won&#39;t be friends forever anymore, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substituted coach&#39;s team, the show of great playing and battling strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and her assistants had “an important share in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison, and the man with the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World heavyweight championship fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve grueling rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title on the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still heavyweight champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion in the version of the WBC association defeated the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on the night from Friday to Saturday in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be performed.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, who is 2.02 meters tall, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, four inches shorter, who before the duel had heralded the end of the Klitschko era, repeatedly dodged the world champion&#39;s blows, so Klitschko couldn&#39;t bring his dangerous right hand decisively to his target.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, just trying to get through the rounds.
Although he was taunting Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now only the second fighter, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, to go twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a &quot;horrible zombie&quot; who &quot;doesn&#39;t know how to do anything&quot;.
At the weigh-in, the champion was provoked Friday into removing Johnson&#39;s sunglasses from his nose &quot;so he could see his eyes.&quot;
Fourth victory after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight since his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained unbeatable.
After a hiatus of almost four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
Later that year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defenses, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to collect all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall, in November.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly misleading.
In Saturday&#39;s &quot;Tagesschau&quot; news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens&#39; group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had &quot;knowingly failed to tell the truth&quot; about the deadly bombing of two convoys. .
In such a case, it is normally said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the gist of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately speak before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional assassination is part of the federal government&#39;s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the green Renate Kunast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
Doubts had also surfaced on Saturday about the ministry&#39;s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it emerged that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the daily &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung&quot;.
So far he hasn&#39;t received a response, he told himself.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, and indicated that this would be clarified in the investigation commission of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
dream worlds
While awake, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts, the limits between imagination and reality vanish.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our darkened rooms with our eyes closed, we can indulge our wildest imaginations and fantasy creations without restraint.
However, someone who experiences sleep-like states while awake, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicted, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
It&#39;s our imagination to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dreams, madness, and reality.
Dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neural communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been thrown off track and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts very frequently appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dreams has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a &quot;great similarity of the state of madness with dream states&quot;, for Sigmund Freud, the dream even it was &quot;a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages of it.&quot;
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power on him, he is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of winged demons, with grins red as blood, misshapen, gnashing their teeth.
They are chasing him, they kick him with heavy, flaming boots, they throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout his body.
Shrill, evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hangman&#39;s noose, and attaches them to a hook in the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
jump.
The rope is released.
Let this serve as a lesson to you!, the voices shout in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, &quot;go to the clinic and have them treat you!&quot;
Henning T. is now 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in their lives with schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent illness after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of over-arousal that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or mania. persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The person affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up is impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in their life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, &quot;the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.&quot;
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are supported by reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it is still unknown why our brain does caprioles.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that there are other determining factors in addition to genes.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system is produced, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can trigger a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
In the same way, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, since they interfere with the transmission system of the brain.
when the brain heats up
The illogicality of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, frequently also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#39;s and head injuries.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or underinhibited; when our brain heats up, but also when there is a lack of stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, lovesickness or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren&#39;t for those pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair talks to him.
When she answers him, the other students look at her in surprise; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of an odd daydreamer, but Sarah K. knows she&#39;s not dreaming.
She&#39;s awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the next bench.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It&#39;s a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she&#39;s crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and they disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class, sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – to his eyes and ears – is introducing a new classmate, while for the rest he visibly and audibly explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While she waits in the dark room for sleep to come, which is often late and scarce, she can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of your open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
She hasn&#39;t told her parents and friends anything, they would think she&#39;s crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the selectivity test last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have disappeared for a year.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they begin to hallucinate.
I believe that the brain is unoccupied and takes charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a child and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he found out that the man he has called dad for as long as he can remember is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, sufferers like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, that&#39;s why they seem so real.&quot;
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are capable of recognizing their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises her patients to appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
Borderline situation between dream and hallucination
In this overly conscious-focused world, imagined experiences are often pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but it also contains something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them believes to be real and cannot subsequently differentiate from being awake.
Oneiric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or of the world due to total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with an imaginary world of one&#39;s own that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness embarked on journeys of several days after a heart valve operation including heart transplantation, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into a world created by himself and visited strange places from other times: he found himself bedridden, an elderly man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the firn snowy Alps, and ran into a Korean mobster.
He gives everything in these imaginary events, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, this is how he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the mental trips are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the internal reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten, &quot;can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.&quot;
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen has come up with a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his sons in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained for it.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire as of January as chairman of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named as his successor.
The 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of the Burda management since 1999.
Initially I was responsible for technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the company&#39;s assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the editorial.
Burda&#39;s children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who would currently be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen&#39;s appointment also serves to &quot;bridge the differences of 10, 15 years,&quot; according to Burda.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are not safe from decline either: &quot;This has always affected families who have been infected by the desire to search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could soar as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had &quot;delusions of grandeur,&quot; says Burda.
I don&#39;t see myself as a political mentor to this country, like Springer was, and I don&#39;t want to play Time in the world league either; those deals have gotten too big.
comprehensive beauty
Everything you could wish for -in terms of beauty and well-being- is at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis &amp; Tachi hairdressers; Marina d&#39;Or, which has a gym, or L&#39;Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own &#39;beauty party&#39; with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and drinking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as some virtual &#39;trainers&#39; who guide the steps of clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal password on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go to the hairdresser&#39;s, the firm Luis &amp; Tachi has a room where rituals for hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the &#39;LIVE Office&#39;.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The &#39;LIVE Office&#39; (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements regarding mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 &#39;electric cities&#39;
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the introduction of electric vehicles.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This is intended to promote Technological Research and Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these would be activities related to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at a European level and has a series of complementary projects active such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees &quot;a horizon of tranquility&quot; for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions &quot;a horizon of tranquility&quot; for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country&#39;s main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government corresponding to 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automobile sector.
&quot;Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants&quot;, stated the President of the Government.
&quot;Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to continue in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,&quot; he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the government measures to support demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automobile brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles sold in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a &quot;strong increase&quot; in registrations, which grew &quot;40 percent&quot; in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from February 5 to 7, 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and classic cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors in the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic motoring that will delight collectors and the curious.
Participating companies will include, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of automobiles; o Classic Garage, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
There will also be skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles on a circuit set up outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good grade achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, habitability, behavior, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we verified that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel box and the console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, which also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine start and stop system, at least for now, is only available with the 150-horsepower two-liter gasoline engine and the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its refinement, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving contained consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
Of the standard equipment, the Lane Change Assistant (RVM) stands out especially, which eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen , parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE sound system with a disc loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers a year may opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
&#39;Premiere&#39; deluxe

The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only be used to check mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or surf the web.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named it one of its products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It&#39;s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and is long overdue.
Yes, some carriers have special deals and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission&#39;s repeated slap on the wrist to achieve affordable roaming rates for the whole of Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a little device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wi-Fi) gets this type of rates means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying different proposals with which to amortize their data network .
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that&#39;s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime access purchase option like Peek already has in the US.
Not because I&#39;m going to buy it.
I check my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle&#39;s fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the first lady of the United States&#39; preferred shade.
If you already attended Barack Obama&#39;s inauguration as US president wearing a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greenish yellow with bright reflections-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and It was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the costume.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of it was thick lace, in Oslo it is a patterned velvet.
The accessories have also varied: green mid-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: an updo this time, loose hair the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study &#39;Fertility and employment history of women in Spain&#39;, prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women&#39;s Institute.
The survey carried out among 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start cohabiting earlier, have their first maternity earlier, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
&quot;Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a permanent job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time in their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work carried out exerts a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the mating schedule&quot;, explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have their first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they get married and have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at an average age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
&quot;Another division is also established between women based on their level of studies.
While those with elementary studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a son,&quot; says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L&#39;Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its coveted list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different brand products, singing the universal motto &#39;Because I&#39;m worth it&#39;.
The protagonist of &#39;Joyeux Noël&#39;, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous L&#39;Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (&#39;Lost&#39;) and Freida Pinto (&#39;Slumdog Millionaire&#39;).
In the men&#39;s section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (&#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline&#39;s partner in &#39;Lost&#39;).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives -designers and models, yesterday and today- met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent&#39;s poker
Manuel Vicent gives away in &#39;Póquer de ases&#39; (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also the other).
He does not do it in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical profile, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: &quot;In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God.&quot;
About Samuel Beckett: &quot;Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, senseless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him .&quot;
About Graham Greene: &quot;Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition. &quot;
About James Joyce: &quot;&#39;Ulysses&#39; was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which a cliff and again the best climbers.&quot;
On William Faulkner: &quot;He was a weird guy.
Sometimes he said of himself that he was the heir to a county landowner, and sometimes that he was the son of a negress and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.&quot;
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: &quot;This writer took up the insane cry launched from a bridge by that character from Munich to carry its echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in its literary form and he did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms.&quot;
On Dorothy Parker: &quot;One day she got down on her knees and prayed, &#39;Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.&#39;
About Joseph Conrad: &quot;On his tomb were engraved these lines of Spenser&#39;s: &#39;The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life enough to please death.&quot;
On Virginia Wolf: &quot;She also brought her depressions with her luggage.
The husband accepted quite normally when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.

On Pío Baroja: &quot;What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?

cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed her and our dog, a mixed-breed, rescued from the kennel. and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without saying a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not find fun in a gratuitous attack on a small and defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this we must add the suffocation caused to a lady who was walking calmly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since a madman who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five in the afternoon on any given Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt will be of much use and in order not to generate susceptibilities, we only clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to freely mistreat a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don&#39;t know where good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which &quot;goes beyond designing and manufacturing products that are safer every day&quot; and affirmed that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, under the slogan &#39;To be or not to be&#39;, will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving the maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety &quot;is a constant concern&quot; for the company, since as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop increasingly safe products.
Light commercial sales rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more important, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to figures from the employers&#39; association of the manufacturers Anfac and from that of Ganvam vendors.
The good data, however, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rise in the last month, accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, adding up all the vehicles that make up the mixed bag of light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Likewise, the dark clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So, in addition to the restrictions caused by the closed faucet of bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Given this scenario and unlike passenger cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can benefit from them, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they once again recalled the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The vendors&#39; association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year just ended, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As it happened with the anti-lock brakes ABS and will happen with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already apply to all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a grace period is set for the rest until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to its way of working, it can also help to avoid many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency braking assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver&#39;s stomp.
But this one doesn&#39;t always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of car components Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use their full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the other hand, demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance the car takes to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -the Probably on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
To this it is not strange that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contacting some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aims to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab&#39;s assets to China&#39;s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
Behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof that has been replaced by a manually operated canvas one, which saves 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 &#39;fall&#39;; removing the air conditioner, 13; by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 more kilos were gained; Mounting sports seats another 12 and with light 19-inch wheels, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for cloth ones, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California back roads, on mountain sections with really twisty layouts.
His behavior can only be described as faultless.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: it had been a long time since we had tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security when cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming up his muscles in a short march for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and squeeze his engine again...
What we ask. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the &#39;sport&#39; option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already released previously in the Panamera. .
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive on the market and that is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.

Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory on their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra stadium, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic&#39;s team had, and thus stands at the top of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 PIR).
The team from Vitoria knew how to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of involvement and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final victory.
The game started in a good way for the blaugranas, who were ahead on the scoreboard from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets from Vitoria were made from the perimeter already presaged that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team from Alava opted for Barac&#39;s inside game and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on their return to what was their home, to continue expanding their lead at halftime. (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points, although Splitter&#39;s &#39;minus six&#39; rating already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night for the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track to rest, was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the people of Vitoria that not just anyone wins on their pitch, and with &#39;Elías&#39; hand&#39; squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively for the &#39;yellows&#39; to turn the light around (50-49).
more drawbacks
Ivanovic&#39;s men, injured but far from dead, needed to string together a couple of plays to catch their breath, and in those moments Mirza Teletovic&#39;s machine gunner arrived, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which the locals managed to make up at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses came out to give their all in the last set and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best on their team, did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to fouls, Ivanovic&#39;s men did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the game already had an owner and victory was slipping away from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost resoundingly in Greece against Olympiacos and handed over the leadership of group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the losses of the compositors, especially in the inside game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the victory Greek.
The team from Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere in the Peace and Friendship pavilion, nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from point guard Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inside game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score around 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, attempted fight, between the two American guards Beverley and Williams, led to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss due to injury to English center Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls by Carlos Jiménez, were weighing down the compositors.
Between the inside players and the Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the lead to 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed themselves to be superior and even came to equalize the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the leadership of the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences, Unicaja due to the direction and Cook&#39;s triples, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because when Olympiacos pressed and given their superiority in centimeters inside the area they were unstoppable.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic managed to overcome the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja faded, handing over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, employment and motor classified ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been running, the search engine has detected that, in general terms, the Spanish worker &quot;feels poorly paid,&quot; Trovit&#39;s product manager, Albert Ribera, explained in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver earns 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The jobs most sought after on the web in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya&#39;s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya&#39;s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that &quot;Mel&quot; knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
&quot;He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.&quot;
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: &quot;My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,&quot; Zelaya declared by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated when Zelaya rejected the political asylum status that the &quot;de facto&quot; government presided over by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose on him.
Thank you so much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant trend in the markets, uncertainty once again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving a free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the gears like the ECB did with its year-to-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without such unorthodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premia.
Stock market volatilities and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt is once again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing a widening of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability, but Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s came along and threatened a new downward review of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not a bad thing to silence the defenders of moral hazard who were once again trying to create a conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects derived from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, what happened in Dubai paints a tribal fight between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and what happened in Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saved Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it is going to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What does make sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalization of temporary risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s thing is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it is not augurs much hope of life to his warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now &quot;prudence, driver friend&quot;.

The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain&#39;s energy strategy for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Of course, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase generation capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international interconnections
As of 2020, the question changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its commitment is focused on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other &quot;support energies&quot;.
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is &quot;a clear long-term commitment&quot; in this sense, despite the &quot;specific&quot; measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, even though they are long-term, must begin to be made now, since they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the &#39;handling&#39; of Aer Lingus in ten airports
Ferrovial&#39;s subsidiary for airport ground services, the Swiss company Swissport, is going to play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million up to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the center&#39;s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy and water management company.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Erns &amp; Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the Toll.
While waiting for them to present their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the running, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium is playing against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O&#39;Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where capital is shared by the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but it entails a clear entry difficulty if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, as well as Asian references, and which continues to be a pending issue for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Office of Infrastructure and called Northern Link, is called to join the western Toowong highway with the ring road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along of 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest single action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar established by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this payment crossing would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to give remarkable results to Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it had obtained a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS&#39;s investee is going to enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower, with 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O&#39;Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 kilometer long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm obtains this contract days after taking over the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will last for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, reported the railway operator.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that entered the contest organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for stopping competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programs outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offenses in the past and, therefore, is a repeat offender.
app store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an application store on the Internet, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth clubs that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn&#39;t just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this deal well.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has pocketed the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, that has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, compared to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will earn 9 million, compared to 5.2 million for the finalist.
Thus, in concept of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But it is that there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and it has four assigned places.
The champion of the previous year keeps 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year&#39;s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group revealed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a maximum of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a takeover bid (takeover bid) for all the titles.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be remunerated with interest for said deferral of 1% per year
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the Nueva Rumasa offer values the company 18% below market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling titles.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial ups and downs of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former counselors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified in the National Court and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.

New tools to appraise cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No loss is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Loss and maintenance service and solution providers are dedicated to compiling the information that manufacturers supply them, to later elaborate it and offer it to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the evaluations are made with their products.
The other firms that compete in the field of appraisal tools and preparation of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each one of them supplies them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car hits the market, these companies go to work.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, an &quot;intelligent&quot; graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be &quot;punctured&quot;.
If it is a massive sale model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very quickly.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized on specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are included each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give it different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the market or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims valuation solution, aimed at adjusters.
Includes automobiles, motorcycles, and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came off the assembly line only with its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared a total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geodemographic analysis or find out the deviations by brands or models.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have gone through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa group company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, breakdowns or car maintenance
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 it had a turnover of 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it settled in Spain.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth 1,000 million dollars on the stock market, and now its shares are listed for a total value of 2,400 million dollars.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s benchmark index.
Internet auction of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company&#39;s capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, workshops, scrapyards and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Türkiye.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed cannot be put back into circulation, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been deregistered after some cumbersome procedures.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate a quote.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans, and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by means of its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and, later, the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and can then print the estimate to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an assessment tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, as it will allow, for example, a door to be selected and turned around to see the inside.
