Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million will be received, among other things, for exceptional efforts in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid such a subject, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to mention.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million CZK).
He intends to donate them to charity, but has not yet decided to which particular organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not fully deserving it.
He also repeated several times that the award is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Society of Litoměřice Nature Defenders) of blackmail.
Last year it appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and demanded money from investors for its own benefit to withdraw appeals, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like garbage bins too much
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia you can find containers for separating garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, for being the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into the right container in the center?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is on Moravské náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Let Mr Onderka and his colleagues not be angry with me, but that seems to me to be too little.
Needless to say, elsewhere it is not easy to separate garbage either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Luckily, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It is still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno very much.
They prefer to buy from the city the hockey extraleague, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a bit, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM company, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or civil servants, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness benefits, or construction savings.
But neither for the interest of the state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government subsequently borrowing for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness benefits. "That just postpones the problems for the future, it's laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay the money back.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it must raise taxes.
Everyone the left added to now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also to their children.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness benefits, they will get them. From these accounts disappeared 1,800 million.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; Next year there will be no shortage of Treasury only 163,000 million, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and it will no longer come with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity benefits, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most that can be done is to keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in jeopardy, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution to the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends ecological damages are liquidated, they serve to complete the account for the incomes or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the incomes.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the true budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Almost three billion was obtained from the budget to grant various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, draw on the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the Státní pokladna (State Fund) project, which has a price of two billion and has already been started. It should make it possible to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, at the touch of a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With the press of a key, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the American company VMware, which concentrates mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems work, Windows Mobile and Android, at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It's not just ski lift maintainers in Krkonoše who are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Martin Jandura, maintainer of the Spindl.Info news portal.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will relent and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše as well, but there are fewer places available.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regular.
This year the interest in winter stays is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be sold out as well," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; Last year was more difficult.
We are about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last places available.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at approximately sixty percent occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše is sure to increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will pass the desire for snow waiting.
Temperatures should drop on Thursday and, if there is precipitation, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a diligent pupil repeats on the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "same as in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 declaration for his own statement: "A New Way Forward."
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war. And he criticized that as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is nothing to talk about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively it left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than might be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of traditional subordinate relationships, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but couldn't think of any better, so he at least deceived the general over 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this procedure in three years. The whole Obama doctrine raised more questions than the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is kept.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. Behind him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated by confused relations, made even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "actionable," a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy clashes because of his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon", will perform some miracle here.
From the political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult choice: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold for at least five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
"I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take," said former JPMorgan banker investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, 20,000 million dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the onset of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a fifty percent tax, bonuses for bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics.
Five women, which is a record number, received this year's Nobel Prizes in Stockholm today in Stockholm from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each laureate collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately CZK 25 million).
In the case of several winners in each category, the prize is shared among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, the Peace Nobel, was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his permanence in the government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janoto's tenure in the cabinet, is supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman said about the meeting.
On his tenure, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, on Wednesday approved left-wing proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious domestic policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, are becoming controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of thrifty measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; Today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public treasury.
According to him, today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted, calling similar words "strong sentences."
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular ones were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the starring roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I will have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slave slavery abolition movement, the fictional U.S. president, and even God in Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong worldwide to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
He had no choice but to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that by squeezing your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it's important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and that is why they continue to affirm that "Bulavá" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at the age of 51 an annual contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in KHL's match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal issues," the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club's coach, as saying.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
"I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players," Nemchinov said.
According to the AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the oldest professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the unions' requirements. Cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all further work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions this year on one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, work will be done in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on Dec. 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all additional work for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they commit to meeting the requirements and the document is signed, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
Management was of the opinion that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency for strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as extra work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Series production was started last November.
As of last September, it had manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; Its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: a substance effective even in the 'callocid' HIV virus
Czech and German scientists test new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus as some already accessible drugs.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; Against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and so can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, 'improved' compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the albumin of the virus.
Metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedra cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are linked by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and mature, infectious virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of  sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "appalling" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS vice-president Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusionment and the feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he is thinking about staying in office.
The reason is their disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do the nominees for the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, whether he will resign, if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to sickness benefits, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It's the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is supported by the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I haven't thought about it, when the time comes, I will deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by ODS members, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went out to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS relented at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS MPs to allow acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the party head in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize that my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the following months it would be mainly a question of Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some lesser-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule takes effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino cart.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not run to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, fewer fast trains will run, direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15. line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13 travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The bill for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive four billion kronor in total next year, the same as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains Drahy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur for day tickets - ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 hostages.
All 17 detained children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in Agusan del Sur province.
They say approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the settling of scores between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23. In November, related to the gubernatorial elections, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected involvement in the massacre arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, will be released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on the 18th. of July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time, the media is shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of starring roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - to gather his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It's a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title loosely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential electoral term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field. RSA won the World Cup back then.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are however sceptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in an interview recently for LN.
The championship starts on the 11th. June 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire has seized in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kroner, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman for the ČEZ company for the Northern Czech Republic, the electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps působí on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander against three hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander against three social democratic hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the hetmán from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins off the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the tests of all the regions. According to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I assume, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately SEK 150 billion they did not call for a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by an ČSSD MP because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't let it, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as an ČSSD deputy, I know, what gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January, children born since August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not having received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily stopped vaccinating their children against pneumococci.
Parents however paid for a dose 1600 kroner and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccines.
However they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent about 500,000 annually for the entire vaccination of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
According to research in hospitals, 28 children no older than 10 years of age die from pneumococal infections in our country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumocal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January you must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this time we don't think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its downsides, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it will be possible to reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that starting next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies vaccinate against pneumococci.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, only to save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about buying vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies might "take the money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the robbery of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth US$20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 frames into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reports an unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the younger Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labour defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also came under heavy criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera over Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems."
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a jobs tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect an estimated 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, from April 2011
Economy to contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person earning £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60 percent of the burden of supplementary taxes would fall on the top 5 percent of wages.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending cuts outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers. It will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence how much to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been cast doubt after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to amend the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £3 billion above previously estimated.
'Missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of Labour's "debt crisis", said the projected loan application of £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult choices until after elections in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything meaningful about what they're going to do," Chancellor in the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sandcastles."
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said the timing of the announcements, such as the above-mentioned increase in inflation from some disability benefits next April, would leave the Chancellor of the Exchequer exposed to accusations of election manoeuvring, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the finance minister's figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really putting the pain off for later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the big announcements will come after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. The markets realize this."
FBI Probes "Arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and under what kind of circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the detentions, Reuters news agency reported; But he said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported them missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime's "models of abuse," before and after the presidential election held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election result.
"I am often hit in the face," in his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations but admitted abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the lights of the city flickering.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and when there is widespread warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of an issue that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France's 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that preoccupy the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and scholar.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The bleakest panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, transportation and fishing interests have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowledgeable about the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who showed courage by taking on the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early twentieth century showcased 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult's realm. The climate is almost never suitable: a Singapore-resident polar bear turned green because of the algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor at New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a breathtaking look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries first gave clues about the movement of ice masses.
Then Cold War submarines mapped the shifting cords of ice circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson peers into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of streams of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they're all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... This could be us
Marines among 6,000 who lay wreaths at Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we're being shipped, this could be us, Robinson said of fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the cemetery's wide meadows and hills.
The volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don't get as many visitors as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, as they carried the fresh pine tree to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, went virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kronor to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the freezing air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others bowed to see small black and white plaques placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers wiping tears from her eyes at her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember him."
Cuban Officials Arrested U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed cellphones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous."
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely spark tensions between the communist Castro brothers' government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times first broke news of the arrest Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity from the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; They are mostly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide further information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly ill-advised.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as handing out free cell phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a scathing report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Same Cuba," a reference to Raul Castro's position as the country's leader.  to replace his sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed within a day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a backlash in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were unfazed and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who they trust.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made trying to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda, a top priority.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is taking a special look at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become adept at their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model than how many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more Web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate 'action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center take bolder climate action.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists planted small explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened at the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding signs in English that read "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "Earth says 'enough is enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said her mother's home country of Peru made me aware of the harrowing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate changes already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black attire planted several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I wasn't really aware of the situation."
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "Since the gathering place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it was up to each other's perspective to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week's federal report card on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
While the district is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the report card showed fourth- and eighth-graders strides faster over the past two years than Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is etched in recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth-graders in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year period, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was released, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only narrowed to 58.
Some education attorneys in the District expressed concern last week, as advances celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we've improved the set by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting," said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
"I'm not jumping for joy over a two- or three-point difference," said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-At-Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade from Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a regular critic of Rhee's management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city's high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-grade elementary and middle school students who did not master early reading fundamentals in their school grades and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a kindergarten-through sixth-grade math curriculum emphasizing real-life games and experiences, that was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level," Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
There's kind of a thorny dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in closing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
You have to reach almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a 185-day year, which she considers an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Hell, really, he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school's low teacher-to-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed his deliberate message: The question isn't whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants dropping out of high school or becoming pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands accessing the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the nation's workforce.
Those who analyze top performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time isn't going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry struck with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies struck deals for auctioned fields in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in opening Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans in the lead, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking a more vigorous risk in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two major fields.
"We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power," Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
Companies shortlisted for proposals made bids that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan's illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car in the direction of the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally mangled bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al Qaeda military planner, who led the terror group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He engaged in plotting around the world, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this likely included conspiratorial attacks on the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly through the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Nakhmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other senior operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
Top UN envoy in Kabul about to step down
The top United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase but worries that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the readiness of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend just two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that they better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations but said the allegations by Galbraith, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed for UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would boost his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undermine his ability to recruit talent.
So much so that U.N. rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran over its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He argued that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be necessary, "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer greatly" from sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, it indicated it would renegotiate on curtailing its nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative deals, in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they haven't been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, including pursuing what Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called on Thursday "baseless and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers.  "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to lessen the potential for conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the chairman of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned their lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began incentivizing young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The median birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the Division.
The number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most contentious mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the policy's enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incentivize more births.
Almost overnight, signs ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unoverwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
Huinan Township, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only reach about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Caolu Township in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, they are robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For parents with two middle-class careers that lower the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents' struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parental time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN panel outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, captured renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders set to arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give poor ones to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit to global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the outlines for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Still, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated talks last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary cuts from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much to save individual economies as it is to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the world's twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are arguing over who should pay for the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as regional advisor on climate change for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even though most major participants say the talks will at most produce a political settlement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government can close a deal.
High-level officials, including Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the planes and rushed into the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so they could narrow down the claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The sheer mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and pass preliminary proposals from hand to hand rather than via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
"We're entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Conservation International's vice president for global policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km/h train redefines Monday's feeling
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Mrs Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching from planes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, all three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow down Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times has learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It looks like this will be the most beneficial option," said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour now.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402km/h, making Britain's network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to adapt to the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave fast lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is regarded as the crucial point needed to ensure a shift from planes to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage for a £75,000 orange grove from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency house.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "on rations", raised his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension on his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
House of Commons officials approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' spending. Last night Mr Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange grove."
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase, during a recent House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges inquiry into his previous mortgage settlements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a £271,406 mortgage on his London property to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications rose to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase would finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard BRE variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate it is at now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as chairman of the opposition House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like m**rda."
He stated, "I spend my money on my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't. "
The MP, a millionaire from his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the pay bureau that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest, after it was revealed that he applied for £4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for overriding improvements, approved both by the pay bureau and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "It's not about circumventing and committing crimes or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It could by no means be clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palapa of Brighton Beach
The palapas of Brighton have found new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day in December, using carols as their theme.
The event kicked off on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, with stuffed pastries and punch served for free.
Carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman for the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated, "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? I believe the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to test and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the frozen Danish capital to demand a deal that the United Nations climate change conference must reach no later than Friday. It would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen is very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, venue of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped approximately 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, mostly in light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on saying: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk along like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement reached out to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing scarves with pro-solar slogans.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of demonstrators were formed demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Abkhazian separatist elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first interim results would be announced late Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of vote counting.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Mankhgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a pretty white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch standing alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different locations in this small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the vote.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and most particularly, for the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a runoff will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around a huge demonstration.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to accommodate the guest speakers. The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, knocking several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We didn't take our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew overhead.
Most of the demonstrators, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, mostly in light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and for the climate".

Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing scarves with pro-solar slogans outside City Hall in the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding action against climate change.

History and geography is strengthened by secondary education reform, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be broadcast in Sunday's News (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would come out "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all first-year high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "hypocrisy is enough" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General Education and Literature cannot be subbranches of the C, he goes on to stress: "nor did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in the second year of high school in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography education in the second year of baccalaureate C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of the right also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second year of baccalaureate C program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will target their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also do practices in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as trainee teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the École Normale Supérieure, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street École normale supérieure.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the "Ernest" conference conference, a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and makes them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed hoping that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier."
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website starting Dec. 15.
The next "Ernest" day is expected for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: disgust among prison guards, action planned
Prison guards' unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd guards' union) called on off-duty staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to denounce the theft of their salaries.
The penitentiary CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", since it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all of them were counted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be meagre, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary demands," deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and public holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we increase the tasks and missions without taking more troops, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, this is not the case in all regions, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, said the secretary general of UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he gives 'better gifts' than he gets
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, that he came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview on ABC Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at their prestigious new residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts of the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama took issue with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously replying by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoted support to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady recalled her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of arranging it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he is in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries derived from the operation" of herniated disc carried out in Paris on November 26, said his press service in that same city, indicating that these injuries "needed a reparative operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance stating that the situation was "under control", and informed that a new medical report would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
Late Thursday, Delajoux declined to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured that "no problem" was made because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was foolish to get twelve hours on the plane after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is overly commented. Fans and journalists noted the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m freestyle, during Euro-2009 in short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (men).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a mark he holds in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from 1 January.
These swimsuits, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself thoroughly into this race.
I knew I wouldn't be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "depicting four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time.  before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Checking the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure for Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said the conditions were not right to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and request political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest sitting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, where he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe-conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister Oscar Raúl Matute told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview on the Telesur network, which is based in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around Brazil's heavily besieged military embassy.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had moved closer to Venezuela's socialist President Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must answer to justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance are faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 broadest index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full."
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent from September to $32.9 billion in October.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, with 474,000 applications being filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that on the 30-year note to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP journalist said.
Die the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" The militants of power chanted with their fists raised to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were detained by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The officers forcibly loaded dissidents into the vehicles who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White," winners of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners," some 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is among 75 Cuban dissidents jailed in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities label opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
A very rare occurrence in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man murders an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Thursday at the busiest time of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an official with the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, stepped in and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was hospitalized "in shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently randomly, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and another forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene remained unsolved.
He was armed with two butcher knives crossed on his back, Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, said at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd poured on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he said.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were fistwounded, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very significant wound in his abdomen," Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, approximately 35 years old, arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention he did not say a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of admitting him to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "every deranged of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "The Pianist," complained to three judges of the Court of Appeals of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) spoke with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious procedural misconduct.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument should the court reject the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?" asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, although he despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not alone in asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, to close the case.
She maintains that her client can no longer stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding, "No one in this room can say the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, enough is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, pending extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with a technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is getting smaller and smaller and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion regarding the strength of the economic recovery," summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads to the downside to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that on the 30-year note to 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw many things and lived countless experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This event, which for the ninth time takes place in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 pm (3 pm GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to surrender my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the austral summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates concentrate on the pageant.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa proved capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I would meet.
She will probably return for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (9 p.m. GMT).
The son of the singer, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection derived from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection, the aftermath of a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French lycée in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Parc Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus maintained that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I was operated twice for a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that apparently the singer had "left without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into a hiatus.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF association (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
Separately, the defense minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the home page of their site, say the signatories of the letter.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (their) website."
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) brand to the legitimate successors in title."
Failure to do so will result in court to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, according to them, the New Centre does not have any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make your own name than to try to leave anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt affirms, he took advantage of the octogenarian's state of weakness to plunder her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of entertainment stars, will stand trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which they must state if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he will accept.
"I'm going to talk to her," Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain one billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the merits of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' arguments were, on some occasions, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that he distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open proceedings for judicial protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be allowed to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule once the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers had taken place.
Managerial revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was a question of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies to conquer markets... Although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to customer preference factors is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R+D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; It needs a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls are relatively useful
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Since they come from the great schools of engineering, they interpret psychology mechanistically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behavioral theory that the American "neurosciences" recently revived, and which the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unadapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: For "Just War" Obama Receives Praise from the Right
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's Oct. 9 award, this time applauded the president's speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
"I loved what she said," Ms. Palin, a leading right-wing figure in the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoir.
In my opinion, war is certainly the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, rejoiced the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said during an interview on "The Takeaway" radio show.
The former elected representative, who some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current reporter at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as he "always does," he "spoke like an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a bubble of security that they did not create and who do little to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president's left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech a "blockbuster" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthused.
Obama "delivered the speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, calling it "both somber and edifying."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supplies
After three marathon sessions of negotiations, the unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the strike slogan and the threat that falls on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau was "pleased" by the agreement, after several negotiation sessions began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text of agreement late in the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew, slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 am was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 pm.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the rectification finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The administration will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies adhering to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "naïve business", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to antagonize those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, lamented Unostra.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months."
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied as far as their demand for a premium is concerned.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 am and 8 pm, at a rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "the RATP is striving to serve department stores."
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak times, and almost no trains at off-peak hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Île-de-France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned to supervise police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or bound for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The director of the ERNs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, pointing out that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led unions to say the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Indépendants have given notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million passengers a day.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of dissolving the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked angry in the Kurdish community, in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision by the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to be dissolved, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and lawmaker Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament before they were MPs without party labels.
The decision follows a proceeding launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has "no organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes as the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
As a matter of principle, we are opposed to the closure of matches.
That doesn't solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master all vehicular technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time over the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 so-called A sections leave with large salted vehicles, Brauburger explains.
This includes, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
They should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES begins around three in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins".
The difficult thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30 am.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
FES would generally not be able to take care of all bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters tall that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn't have been something special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was located in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in a day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis team member of the Natural History Museum of Utah.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A find confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don't entirely share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous theropods among which are Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, quadrupedal sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with bird pelvis).  to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae the researchers found indications of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa Hallae's case, too, the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa the remains of two other theropods not very close related.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We think there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group to dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because many dinosaur fossils are still preserved in South America, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to dominant Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs expanded throughout the world and many new species developed, while kinship became extinct on the border of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories aren't always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, in California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University reverberated around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike vacated last week, because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, judge the signatories, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented "an unacceptable attack" on freedom of inquiry and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and diverted attention from content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen's Minister of Science, nevertheless defended the actions of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was regarded as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow's ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration".
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses commercial relations.
FIZ companies will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the downsizing of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will plunge the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region into a decade of chaos of hopeless construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 grew out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, since formerly it took an enormous amount of time to hook the locomotives from back to front.
Roll, stop in its tracks continue the journey; But that is how it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a way station, which is located approximately halfway through the trans-European lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's trolley at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built by ICE to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railroad continues, also because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The way station and road support are intended for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are not good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the airport ruling.
The federal government is leaving it pending in the autonomous parliament in Wiesbaden if it is going to appeal against the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had written on this date that in the case of the planned construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt airport, the Land would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to drop their appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and FDP to respect their promises to ban overnight air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as lack of words.
It is difficult enough, if one is allowed to keep one's word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federal government would be trying through distortions of the law and tricks still get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally blameless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group's claims about banning night air traffic.
U.S. banks repay the aid provided.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are shedding their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned at once the aid that had been provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30,000 million euros).
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC in the United States.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised approximately $19 billion of liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked American taxpayers on Wednesday night: The financial injection helped get through very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the investment bank's absorption at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source in well-known circles that the US bank could announce as early as Thursday the increase in its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative for Citi declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick choice
In the end everything went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the broadcaster, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the guild's 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the close of writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organised by the President of the Hessian Government, Mr Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender's direction the ZDF news would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flogged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had even meddled in the debate, who described Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
He then worked at the radio station "Südwestfunk" and at the daily "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, initially to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 director and host of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 Director of Foreign Policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional lawsuit after the dismissal of Brender, who was still chosen on Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's opponent on the administrative board, the chairman of the Rhineland-Palatinate government explained last week that the Länder should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director's staffing proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of pro-ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the administrative council could vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the Frey parties he is still attributed to the left-liberals.
University careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Länder Ministers of Education and Culture finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race must end with only one exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to drawing up more flexible structural rules together for Bachelor and Master's degrees.
Regulations of the federal states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities continuously talk about the improvement of being able to successfully carry out and conclude a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with only one exam," says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
The "significant reduction of the examination burden" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative."
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "re-accredited" every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Those responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies throughout the country, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
Education and culture ministers urged Länder in October to influence agencies so much that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate claimed to provide additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Land and the universities intend to have EUR 10 million available for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of the university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to guaranteeing the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again about the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
The board of directors at the federal level of the Juso (Young Socialists) university groups demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students should now be able to weigh in as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely enough: the union demands a legal right for every student with a bachelor's degree the possibility of accessing a later Master's degree.
In addition, the Länder must ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be sufficient study places for Masters with the best possible study conditions in the future. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Länder have to recruit significantly more teachers.
But on greater access to the master's degree, education ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically without control" says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalancing idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lessons or talks in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files."
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not sufficiently defend himself against the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear," Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken and especially the community of German authors from Romania by a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system,  which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as is known so far, not only the perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM Walter file had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence on him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the hard spots for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this claim," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly Zeit, having read her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the Securitate's treatment of control files is still rather diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather dragged.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securitate de Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the awardee.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there is silent blame.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the attribution of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the VfB Stuttgart football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed that an elegantly dressed member of the foreign service was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration.  in which the manufacturer of sporting goods would have distributed samples.
The man with the characteristic bald head had hired a driver, because he still didn't know the city.
For the rest, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would start again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the knockout stages", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Raffle
The knockout stages of the Champions League (first legs on 16/17 and 23/24 February/second legs 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the withering entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered profis of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more outspoken, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had an effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was evidently missing when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overtaken by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had arrived, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt didn't feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after the first win at his home in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, which had decided to change coach due to the pressure of teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the defender.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the substituted coach's team, the spectacle of great force of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a significant share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; And so did the man in the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC association champion beat American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision on points (120:108, 120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already a two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be performed.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was repeatedly dodging the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to get through the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, to endure twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "doesn't know how to do anything".
While performing the weigh-in, the champion allowed himself to be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he beat Nigeria's Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year he later beat Juan Carlos Gómez, of Cuba, in his defense of the title, and in September Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight I only received one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to gather all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall, in November.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly deceiving.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had "knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately speak before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The chancellery had no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also emerged about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received a response, it was said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, and indicated that this would be clarified in the investigation commission of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality vanish.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be crazy or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or drugged.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, one can refer to similar processes the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazed thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, grimacing red as blood, misshapen, gnashing their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shrill and evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, ties them to form a hangman's knot, and fixes them on a hook in the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Salta.
The rope is released.
Let it serve as a lesson!, shout the voices in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; In psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent illness after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outer and inner worlds, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it is still unknown why our brain makes jokes.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
"We suspect that the brain's neural maturity is affected early in development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy," Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can provoke psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, from Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analysed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain heats up, but also when there is a lack of stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, lovesickness or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. He was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise. No one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little odd dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She is awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is introducing a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
In the evenings, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which is often late and scarce, she does not know if she is awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he shouts at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. He is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have disappeared for a year.
Since she has come into contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is idle and is responsible for seeking entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of the other children as a child and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she has called Dad for as long as she can remember is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are fundamentally no different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Borderline situation between sleep and hallucination
in this overly conscious-centered world, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Dreamlike conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, he replaces a very dangerous real situation with his own imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness embarked on multi-day journeys following a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he was bedridden, an old man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched over his health.
He was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed over his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
He gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychoses, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.

The new publisher Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and are determined to join the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next thing in question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would kill the children and also the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kulen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
I was initially responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of direct marketing, foreign marketing, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "bridge the 10, 15-year gaps," according to Burda.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking ahead to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decline either: "This has always affected families who allow themselves to be infected by the eagerness to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of grandeur," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with "Time" in the world league; Those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish for – in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
As, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal password on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 at night.
Assorted necklines
Christmas is approaching and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities linked to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of promoting electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles

Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit enabled outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not incompatible with respect for the environment.
Therefore, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the cockpit, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one that also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact presents a habitability more than enough for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine's automatic stop-start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the 150-horsepower two-litre petrol engine and with the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise, for the benefits and for achieving contained consumption.
And although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
The standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor,  Bluetooth and Bluetooth Audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bi-xenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year can opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality with Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to check mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or surf the net.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Smartphone travelers already know what it's like to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check email.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been up and running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience you need a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated tugging of ears to achieve affordable roaming charges for the whole of Europe has hardly had any discernible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime access like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred shade of the American first lady.
If you already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greenish yellow with bright reflections-, both times the outfit was composed of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dress.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected on this occasion, loose hair the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and career of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together as a couple earlier, advance the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with permanent work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood although less on the pairing calendar", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and at which they have their first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"There is also another division between women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal slogan of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent gives away in 'Poker of aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
He does not do it in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical semblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition nucleus of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and re-reading.
Here are some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fateful destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed up the north wall, from which the best mountaineers fall again and again."
On William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, sometimes he said that he was heir to a county landowner and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry launched from a bridge by that character of Munich to carry its echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Sleep after effort, / after storm the harbor, / rest after war, / after life long pleases death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Edward VII spied her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of her madness."
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and,  Without a word, they kicked him twice that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression to a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this we must add the suffocation that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energúmeno that attacks an animal, is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o'clock in the afternoon on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt will serve much and not to generate sensitivities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to gratuitously mistreat a defenseless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the case of suffering an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and affirmed that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of an educational and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
The sale of light commercials rises
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more important, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not osbtante, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn in the last month, registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, adding all the vehicles that make up the catch-all of light commercial vehicles: derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions posed by the closed tap of bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Given this scenario and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can benefit from them, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled again the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As happened with the ABS anti-lock brakes and will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a grace period is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by the way they work, it can also help avoid many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency braking assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the stomp that the driver gives.
But it doesn't always keep that pressure going until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of car components Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided – when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system becomes popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – the day 8 probably – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
To this it is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
Should there be no deal with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been replaced by a canvas roof with manual operation, which saves 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos more were gained; riding sports bacquets another 12 and with light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for fabric ones, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission, mainly on secondary roads in California, on mountain sections with really twisty paths.
Their behaviour can only be described as blameless.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: it had been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, transmitted so much security when cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short march for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and squeeze his engine again...
Whatever we ask of you. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already released previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
Electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; And that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the parades of the 'maison', the singer lavishes her bad face with as much contumacia as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and in this way is placed in the leadership of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 of valuation).
The Vitorian team knew how to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although they had to suffer until the end to take the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started in the face for the Barça, who were ahead from the beginning on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorianos were from the perimeter already presaged that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alava team opted for the interior game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause in the return to what was his home, to continue extending his advantage at halftime (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' of valuation of Splitter already presaged that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track at halftime, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorianos that in their court not everyone wins, and with 'the hand of Elias' pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More drawbacks
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), who managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alava came out to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's team did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the game already had an owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost resoundingly in Greece against Olympiacos and gave it the lead of group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither by the entity of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from point guard Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, conato of fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss due to injury of the English center Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing down the boxers.
Between the interior players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to match the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead of the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences Unicaja by the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos when pressed and given its superiority in centimeters inside the zone was unstoppable.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to overcome the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja was turned off, giving the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The How much should you charge? It calculates the salaries of users from more than 140. 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, explained in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit of its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 received by a Spanish one.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when his term would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, just this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated when Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thanks a lot
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant trend in the markets, uncertainty reappears again in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatilities and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing a widening of the spreads of the euro area countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but that was when Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral hazard who tried again to create a burden of conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects derived from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and we have seen it before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from a default on its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What does make sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitory risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public bond spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European spreads narrow and ours continue to widen, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing most research services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy in the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its commitment focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Bill just approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken now because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground airport services, Switzerland's Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance includes an investment of €20 million by 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the center's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
France's Bouygues and Germany's Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and concessionaire of highways.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Waiting for them to submit their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums compete with a notable presence of European construction companies.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in the race, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French firm specialized in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending issue for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the City of Brisbane and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the Western Toowong Highway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the biggest move to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit for Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it had won a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS investee will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after taking over the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for early 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, reported the railway operator.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest organized by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA that was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined €63 million for curbing competition
France's competition regulator has imposed a €63 million fine on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was, in fact, increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the wake of other operators and has opened an online application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out well from this distribution.
The white club has been the third in the continent that has pocketed the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, invoiced more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist's $5.2 million.
Thus, in concept of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion keeps 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday detailed the details of the offer to purchase shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a takeover bid for all the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be remunerated with an interest for said deferral of 1% per year
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial ups and downs of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the coming months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former counselors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing its destination.
The CNMV authorises the takeover bid for Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the takeover bid filed by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation to understand that its terms comply with the rules in force and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory prospectus presented after the modifications introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which may not be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of current regulations.
New tools for car testing
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims valuation and maintenance services and solutions collect the information provided to them by manufacturers, and then develop it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and information tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "punctured".
If it is a sell-out model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it's a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in developing these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are included each month, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or to calculate the market or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the flagship product AudaPlus, the standard solution for claims valuation, intended for surveyors.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by brands or models.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns or maintenance of the car
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 workshop users, 3,100 surveyors and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% in the last three years, and in 2008 they invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it settled in Spain.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth 1,000 million dollars on the stock exchange, and now its shares trade for a total value of 2,400 million dollars.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the benchmark Standard & Poor's index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars as well as motorcycles or special vehicles damaged.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, surveyors, renting companies, workshops, scrapyards and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 surveyors.
3,000 daily ads are managed and in the Spanish market about 100 new ads are included every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been decommissioned after some cumbersome efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the client.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it over to see the inside face.
