The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
ČEZ’s stock transactions reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, early Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday’s drop when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is the market reaction to the result of the American Assembly of Representatives vote that refused to support the financial sector secretary’s stabilization plan.
Fall of stocks in Asia
Asian stocks saw a dramatic drop on Tuesday, though throughout the day the index eventually dimmed some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock index over its financial day marked nearly four percent, though it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the index secretary fell to 3.6 percent.
“The scheduled bailout stocks in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Currency Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner) should be dedicated.
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject 700 billion dollars into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American finance system.
Their vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a breach in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its aid to the American financial system with the amount of US$700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, he is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it is voted on.
The financial system aid plan will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and Assembly Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a psychologically significant first factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We made a breakthrough.
We resolve our dissenting views on the way the package of measures for market stabilization should have," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund a definitive form.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already on it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Democratic Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively approve a deal Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ businesses in the face of the Asian finance market since these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved, which consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
Also, President Bush is pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's progress and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the taxpayer tax protection program’s responsibility for their losses, a spillover closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
The Ministry of Finance would have to run it.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a breakthrough towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burdens of debtor installment payments and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be made but quite difficult.
"And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price will problem assets be bought.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for server iHNed.cz.
That the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"A lot more important is that, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that that approval will be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing, "insisted Marek.
The triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they form 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Heavy and special losses have suffered the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously reeling.
By contrast, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, so it loses 5.5 percent of a vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
The OVP has yet to end that loses 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular who called this early election.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had in terms of preference to the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be reached on Monday at the exceptional meeting of the presidency of the party.
Such an evolution would evidently facilitate the path of the constant and closest starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
Since the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was dismembered by BZO) for a government
For this evolution, Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Armed Hand Fight: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP albums no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records are crowded on your shelves with art rock, jazz or blues music, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of turntable.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just like for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try out the twenty-wreath market helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In the face of the most elementary functions such as telephoning, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse photography device and can even get navigation.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs are going to have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone the display indicator will illuminate by asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy swallows.
Few are the mobiles that manage to play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top, they constantly call themselves still, for more security, a charger for the job - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst ones endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately only part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some reader units without reduction can the small memory cards that are used in mobiles can connect.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer’s USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order alone in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, interest in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, the music as background and you will listen to it every day just for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough for you to play with any mobile that plays.
What virtually really gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod) company.
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of a classic headphone input.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous ordinary cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account by data reduction.
Which apparatus to decide for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g., Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy yourself still a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 kroner is needed.
If you consider among the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the walkman line have almost identical use as a separate MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand kroner, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most arrious brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long in coming.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates, a paradoxical situation is probably reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they are sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to lament that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has also said that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in prices against which classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, you don’t need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from this, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, it is enough for them to have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, is often countered by the offer of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the economy with respect to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to a nothing trivial target group.
This operator specifically targets man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking — he’s the operator he likes and who can be trusted,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept like Poland could be hooked on our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the service offer is relatively saturated"
There are no chances in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R. Czech doesn't seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studničková, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone conversation for mobile.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real Telefónica O2 competition in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phone services.
And how much earlier, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly encountered all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then, maybe they'll flash better times.
It seems that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"Right now we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date, no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršeň, a spokesman for Telefónica O2 for mobile.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2’s opinion, adds: “Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.”
He adds: “On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this time we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short horizon"
Vodafone directs your attention rather to the fulfillment of the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s primary strategy in this field is found in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of U:fon’s entry by the T-Mobile company.
It is attested by public information accessible on the ČTÚ websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “In addition, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
Regarding the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements.
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (US).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
To date, no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS foreign relations department, added to our question.
These statements are not surprising to the operator representatives.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from this they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
The dramatically shocking thing in this whole case really lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and has therefore no reason to intervene.
Neither operator has a dominant position therefore have no corresponding increase in responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunication regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Obviously there is a relevant market analysis drawn up by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech traders has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should represent a warning that three mobile operators ascend strikingly in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility in ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We have met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently tabled for the extension of ČTÚ competition in the field of commercial tenders that was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator is still working unnoticed that in Czech mobile telephone networks there are already a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services which, however, only a part are public.
Usually these are companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same instructing a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases were discovered such as those cited, it could be said of infringement in the conditions of contract that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies cited, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a not negligible profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percent of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card on your phone is not in your name so they cannot have it absolutely as a normal customer of the operators."
This is precisely what should seem to the minimally strange ČTÚ.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator’s input?
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has enough competition to discover this type of activities and if it will not want to be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we will stop being the most expensive
As was already clear from the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this break-in.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have intervened at the moment and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to raise the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Organ all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives on these lands, then the Czech mobile market will likely start moving again.
If any of the operators let in any virtual mobile operator it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to all four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are available four versions - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one in female voice, another with Choir and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of the singing.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlavek regards this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose the Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then, also, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be in line," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home first played in 1834 on the boards of the Theatre of States in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people made her her own.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
This can be acquired at the moment by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the infocenters and transport company stalls at Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy,
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about ticket stalls at subway stations, where until now they regularly had to queue to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased on the internet, and the Opencard is recharged in one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared personnel that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the reloading of the voucher bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard in the automatic vending machines that are in some metro lobbies.
What are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them in the stations of the Roztyly metro, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
That is, on the ring roads and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The ring road buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's ticket office.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring road buses and do not remember when it is finished the validity of the voucher can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Southeasts asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the board of trustees of the United States of America.
With this wish some groups of Germans from the Sudetenland were presumably addressed to the president of the USA in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want their word that the American units are arriving in German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "the people who carry the fate of Šumava in their heart."
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the German south-east presumably supposes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it will give us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it does not at all collaborate with the victory of the allies,” the letter wrote.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the “Czech oppressors.”
If the president of the U.S. presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organize in the šumavas lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their board of trustees.
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have current of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists it paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to minimally sense that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetens some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and placed him in the prisoner camp of Holstein dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they returned home, the Czech would use it," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, said that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport in the media decided to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The minister's office, Aleš Řebíček, promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous behaviour at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, internet and brochures.
I would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind them that before getting going the belts are tied.
He wants to reach awareness above all of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and ultimately also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that ram emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "brançae" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man in a moment of layoff can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
He promises that way he will reduce accidents and the number of dead on Czech roads.
The announcements have been produced by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red traffic light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specific the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinian and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday he appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) lands if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll take a little percent of these lands, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of Israel's lands) because without this there will be no peace."
He admitted that in case of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or bulldozers to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not intend to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan withdrawal," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (Chita movement), they must detach themselves from the permanent support caused by Hamas (Chita movement) terrorism, al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles, a cooling of Czech-Indian relations could be reached, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is how the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not to be solved then yes, then this cooling would surely be reached," he said after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Their problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Afterwards you can request the exoneration of the case and wait free for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself on the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then it would be possible to pardon," the Czech diplomat said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted man a "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining with India the best relations, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, he stressed that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to jail and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he only found.
Questions after the accident: Are hostesses illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic accident of the student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, we are asked if the stewardesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the hostess is opposed to the road traffic law,” says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the vehicle despite having two other places reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the precise moment when the stewardess delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no places to go standing, which the company’s director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat, "he told us his position.
The hostess does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the hostess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," spokesman Hanzelka adds, less strongly.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approved allowed to have walking sites.
That's it," he says.
The buses are divided among the urban, where there are places to stand and limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand with a greater permission of speed and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the greatest permission of speed and with the seats equipped with a seat belt.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s transport safety expert, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems in the movement of the flight attendant on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here you don’t have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the flight attendant can be hit on the head.”
"However, if the bus suddenly suddenly brakes that physical laws are valid.
The same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must solve the internal regulations of the carrier, "he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier to offer the hostess service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks hostesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no flight attendants, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
There was a huge tragedy
In the crash of the line linking Naples, a young Pilsen flight attendant who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the flashers.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the flight attendant were sold.
"These sites are not possible to reserve for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects financial expenses also by the part of the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision about the movement of the hostess on the bus in which for a year that thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march, "says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of safety in the buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
A Czech referees a fight on the seafloor
I approach an electronic wall map, in it is represented to Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but of a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this mood and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with coasts have begun today to dispute the new territories under the sea vehemently.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
This has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Rim.
"Simply by the mainland edge is meant the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the sea coast boundary, and often, to the two hundred-navy border, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Edge continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of job preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domain.
However, so did New Zealand – the seafloor surface granted to it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain that will be derived from the use of the seafloor will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do it until the age of ten from the moment they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Wherever the continental edge ends, the region of the ocean floor declared by Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is administered by the treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not any gold mine,” says director Mikulka with emphasis, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneering investor".
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is bumpy, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported by Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the West LB bank for his collaborators there are no shortage of big words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with DEKA bank can form “a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group,” as the letter says, published on Monday
West LB, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
Furthermore, such a merger may be a start to subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
Thus comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just as before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the federal financial services surveillance institute that has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from the Frankfurt part, there has been a lot of talk about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August let him know that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now comprised of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or some parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the involvement of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merger of the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to pass, the BayernLB union with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be only a young partner, although so far it excelled much better from the financial crisis that the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans to coexist with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand it is about the compatibility of different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, that the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband until now gave no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, naturally, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank
Since you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds he knows how to produce in his throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, `direction Munich, the beer party', foreseeable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing to the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial fur lining and glasses with silver-colored temples, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the lap.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of the Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
Okay like that, they'll still need the forces.
He stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration make another break on the 8 motorway shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has the planned arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent open, that means walking!" shouts Marco in the early morning.
"Getting Away!" March and occupy the back sites in the tent.
"Do not take the places in front, because we are going to block, and all with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, scattered throughout!"
A liter of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He barely leaves his place, he will be busy now!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly ten thirty you have to get here!" Have you understood?
And now everyone's going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, ties the yellow caps in the trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The Italians’ favorite tent is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
How well, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a billion-lion credit to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: the credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks also from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects were financed by them only a short period – which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the reserve of capital of the bank in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity fell slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net financial trading profits fell to zero, indictment revenues for debtors and some securities securities also those of the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, at 5 million euro.
Only thanks to the high and high income of reimbursements of compensation expenses from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the refund of interest under the federal tax code and organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could accuse a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier initially lost in speculations with industrial credits for real estate, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and funding of community projects by private and as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations about the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were canceled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans dropped essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services surveillance institute (BaFin) are on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That’s what shareholders and bank creditors have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that funding in its full volume should not be needed.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
There was a voice that on the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least worried people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing courses based on the position in the property registry clearly tend downward.
Affected are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans whose expirations exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from the early payback.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already on its edge became a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their head about the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the new-account transportation of losses for upcoming benefit compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was at the site of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are being known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the salvation action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore in the place of liberation were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As the spokesmen of the ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that time did not come," a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the assailants had hijacked a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from side to side in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers was left unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say any words about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from German air forces and reach Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to perform at the Highschool in Tachibana, the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"First day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had been turning to introduce myself.
In addition I am not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I wore an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I got to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At the moment I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and beckoned and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my manga.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to her had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked many questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then at recess everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what like here in Japan.
Things are weird and they have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, perhaps with the exception of salt marinated plums, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in very artistic mode for a boy and gives it to him in hope that he can get to know him better during a recess.
About that I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why precisely Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me. "
For years I have been preferring to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the salvation package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with little a large 700 billion dollar salvation package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected financial markets with 227 votes to 206.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It's hard to receive political approval to avoid something that hasn't yet absolutely happened," he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state salvation package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To let the current program in place it is necessary to have approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats have feelings too
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why has it also been afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, behaving in the way like us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" since many years the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think what is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and general awareness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: the dead man is made, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Naturally I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and in the executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created like a whole, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to measure because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, so its research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consent experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their content, and that is what happens during short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential happens rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what of that for the sensations?
I owe to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Viewed from this point of view, the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify the states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others by ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it not likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the likeness of behavior still does not prove the likeness of experience.
That is true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you try it in case of rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows it?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly distinguished primarily from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and the tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, while the same is measured of rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
I can say that I don’t see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than work permanent without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: Grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said the preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organise the European championship alongside Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in the two countries there is much to do."
The construction schedule and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums is going to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said Ukraine association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA won't take our eyes off."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of sporting minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As the German travel association (DVR) reported on Monday in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research institute of the GfK markets research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Above all organized travel is very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared last year, fell.
Counterattack by Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life—and has trouble with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The two roses' backward war on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as a unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of that Meg how many times he tells the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old told "New York Daily News."
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married and recently is a twin's pope.
And so he ends his statements highlighting: "Whether my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices for airline and hotel tickets are falling
In the first half of 2008 airline tickets and overnight tickets in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany went cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and overnight stays in hotels became cheap again - this is the result of a study by American Express' travel service and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a large change in the second half.
After many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus break a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy-class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half of the year they dropped to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even cut in half.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the rise of the loose economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the plane travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - in Europe alone were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the goal eleventh.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the hard landing of national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whisled at the cabin entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
I did not spend anything special in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as one of those who were a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in a sign of nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today everything was not pleasant to see," Marcell Jansen added later.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty win," Martin Jol said.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will be 121 years old.
On Saturday of the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to play it," said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial scores of the table correspond more to the league’s speed than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with his forced players late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless spa, the beer in jars of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit tailored.
I have dark colored hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that binds us together: we’re barely in a tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photo – it’s very slyonic especially because I’m first at Oktoberfest.
That's how he makes friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa’s Prado everything is not that much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be standing up or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniquese draws my attention to my apron who had dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is widowed. "
Or God, now I'm fastening from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
Others don’t care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where “To drink to get got dress!” is written and show, without asking, for their knot ass.
A young boy who behaves in exhibitionist way is named Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after putting his glass next to a liter of beer that he just had drunk.
He put it straight next to the fire hydrant, most think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, the groups of health workers run through the place of party and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walks from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: Sobers arrive, they return drunk.
You can't see who suffers from the degrees of alcohol and is in the ways.
"They are the ones who "can't do more," gave me the answer a health care provider answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
After the voting defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks’ salvation package dropped the Down Jones a certain period to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points during a day in their history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
Around 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world traded a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1548 points.
At this time the largest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares were nearly 10 percent lost.
Only a few days ago had a great investor Warren Buffett been financially involved in the company.
The salvation plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid suddenly but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cashier.
Stock courses in Europe and those in the U.S. continue to decline
The aid of one billion for banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate lowers and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the state-projected financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
Losses from speculated stocks in the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall in a large deficit.
Despite the salvation actions of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s stock a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Worldwide, financial markets suffered a decline.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the U.S. government’s 700 billion-dollar salvation package is not enough to give boosts to financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the project of salvation, the Senate vote may be October 1st.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese main index Nikkei after profit fell to 1.26 percent by 11,743.61.
In Hongkong, the Hang-Seng index dropped to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor’s stock lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of spatial probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the bewilderment to researchers: Dark Matter has influenced the speed of space probes during the so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes the bewilderment among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the gravitational field energy of a planet, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just like the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as they are expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent irregularities in speed.
Suddenly the probes have greater or lesser speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter to the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now that Einstein did not mistake and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of the so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remain in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of Dark Matter only since ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudan's kidnappers had demanded millions of the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations regarding the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back on the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
On that the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are free.
“Now we control his health status,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and in safety, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to descriptions by an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them have detained in the Sudan-Chad border area and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be handed over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the women’s hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be held in detention until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was implicated in the crash that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the crash, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through an inquiry, learned that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Ms. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead" as if she had "waived life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confessional letter that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim you must have been a frightful experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking off her own life.
Even more clearly, if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended up in court.”
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse was about his daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip to the Ministry of Defense, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being turned over to the police.
Surely it is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Building societies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction societies could face a price of more than 80 thousand pounds after the rescue/salve of the bank Bradford and Bingley.
The government, in effect, provided 14 trillion pounds to protect deposits from the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the interim, are supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is to say that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Construction Societies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will have the need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members from what could be a relevant price," Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demanding interest, which may be almost twice as much.
Being the building societies mutual organizations and no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates on their savings.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was inting to be a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inwards Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to close the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit decadent.
But once the ticket office is over, there is no doubt about the greatness of the company that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that is cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been declining and was left out of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government excellently maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, both the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah factions, Iraq and Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic shift in the Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and "power shops" where middle-class managers in business suit - men and women -- meet in the early morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
I brought, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and West.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose? "
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to face that choice."
Next, it underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had recited me almost by heart: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in what the continent will be to which this fascinating country must claim.
The price of milk rises from five pence per liter
Jersey-based residents will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pitches a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pince increase in February and followed by research carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February, was in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be jailed when she returned to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations in his charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s government, militarily supported, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make an appeal to the Supreme Court against the Superior Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad on probation," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-backed interim government took office but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges that they are charged.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – the UN says – have not taken advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it could not reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision requiring the company to reduce its stake in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competence Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV below 7.5%.
The Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hinder competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of ITV stake raised doubts about ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin’s chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB said the compound to reduce his ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, he would have turned over his voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of American lawyers
The Attorney General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department inspector general criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department prompted the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for underperformance.
But it later emerged that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and they may be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the layoffs, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for the layoffs, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush’s former aide, were criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the rankings.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained in the rankings for about nine years and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply on duty.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and stretches north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active track.
There are no signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the Primiera Calle
that wants to repavement Extra Place and create a clean hallway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include old-faming neighbors who commented that they were thrilled by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the ownership of the buildings.
However, the City Housing, Preservation and Development Department, which is in control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community of Dair Committee for Land Use that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the Community’s district manager n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came during this month’s meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was a city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than the management of the city.
Compared to its more colored surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on the story.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the deck of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, still modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece, a city slit that should be protected.
Jeremías Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow, dead end, also dark for the day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked pretty much the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now houses a luxury clothing store was stopped nearby.
Graffiti on the walls and a bottle of near 22-oz empty beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that a cleanse could be given.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noticed that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr.' campaign. Obama notes that “African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “bilingual transition education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overriding the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newly arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated on the 2008 math exam
and almost a staggering 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than what is favored by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main one on the Sixth Street, the school’s focus for English instruction to students is on “total immersion.”
English immersion means the almost exclusive use of the language in the processing of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who has arrived from Mexico and who, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to collect what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If really Mr. Obama wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil dropped sharply Monday because of concerns that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares declined from 7 percent to US$99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at US$145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly US$90 a barrel earlier this month, before backing down, once again, from huge uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety gripped investors, once again, on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached a deal over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the frenzied weekend, negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "seem to have been unable to revive market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected in a recess in demand for commodities, including oil.
“The outlook for global equity, the interest rate and exchange rate is going to become increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
The bank’s analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter crazy: team sets record
Having spent, for the past eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen it all.
Then he watched things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without scoring into a game of deflating.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this time it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when one cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were in the prey, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned him 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken office with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a definitive 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets never did in a room.
Team coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points unanswered in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the terzero.
They have earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselassie rested to head his world record
Once again, Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie has shown that many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable race in the plain in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he signed up for running in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using in average a few sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Kenya’s Paul Tergat have become long distances, the marathon record has shrunk by more than two minutes in the past decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that she had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left it fresh, unoxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-East rival - for the style of orchestrating their careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and setting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles of the finish, Gebrselassie picked up a final push to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, came as a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also didn’t take part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a smart studty race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head-on, and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Magarsa won second place in 2:21.31, while Kenya's Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated into the country and Zora Neale Hurston's childhood place, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in Florida’s travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Season of Depression – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to share their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and does not know what is being lost."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes disdained, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialectical books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inwards the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"Off the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, taken care of by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates to Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, is remembered that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today prides herself on dressing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," follows Mr. Franklin.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in stamping.
Like most people in the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 biography of Mrs. Hurston.
A certain turn came in the 80’s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50’s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they went around town throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, once, too.
They threw him against a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents say today that school desegregation, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — it was used to hugging the teacher in the morning and evening,” N.Y. said. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural gap there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just like she did, with buoyant, confidence and lines like, “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous grave of Ms. Hurston and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it to American canons.
The road project came just the moment Eatonville’s most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People from abroad like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (carrying the name Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, over a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: Just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like a street of the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A An advance permit is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community can be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Ms. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It’s a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, which he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stand up and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice finding themselves in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of bee-nested offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers monopolizing New York face daily with the worst “bad day of the office” since the 1929 slump.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between cargo apartment buildings, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning takeout, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on business days.
Employees still wait to queue their bagel to the sellers’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there is, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not ahead of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy’s department store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker", and they were in line for the same reason I did.
Unlike me, they had still retired their savings from smaller banks in places from where they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a little like a construction society), from the credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose banners only work within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people from New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grieving-looking chief executive, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fiftieth and somewhat concierge in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping on the shopkeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my money market funds savings.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Which Guildford Musical Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Sept. 11) was responsible for the Guildford and Choir Philharmonic Orchestra.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21, but the moment the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 - we just refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being a changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in music.
That way you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxed, or too flowery.
Whatever the musical scard, always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world.”
We'll be very missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research grant from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral one."
This is learned in a note from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career, is unknown.
Desecrated Muslim tombs at the time Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting mosques with a red line going through.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun Cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened by the attempt to hide the real motives of the hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was somehow related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached the Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was running out.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that claimed nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against head scarves and burqas, and further expressed opposition to food considered Islam-related.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly with young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, of traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police filed a travel ban abroad on Thursday after the magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, in the Judges' Court of Ashford in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travels abroad as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, on the basis of being under the register of sex offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to keep an eye on someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all the possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risks that may exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior calmed down and made it happy to know that they had banned Glitter from traveling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master out of the picture to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
To one side the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, carefree because they will not go out on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the program of the Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take photos of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque chamber.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember the classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery The Photographer.
Well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "PortARTprojects".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, whether it is a long or short moment.
I think that within photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don’t even know, or that leave you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotomata Gallery, located at number 20 de la Mata street, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is bent on carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I would not, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience given to the one who was very short of the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great dose of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in it, derived from the "extrordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes in "a disciplined way" to supply his "lack ofVictor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced their vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more unhappy", so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
The weather diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of checks
The celebration of rejones that closed the payment of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown of Castilblanco
So, only Friday there was celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid his two stands with greetings and an ear, which they granted more the layings than his bullfight.
Of course, worse was El Juli, who went through the thing of Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a work of relief he won the anger of a large part of the public.
They skip a check in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they start the flight.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
Officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Traffic Unit of Álava carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
Officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shoulder, at which point its two occupants got out to flee to the race in a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally gave reach to one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and that they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bundles of hashish, so they proceeded to move it to police facilities for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested one has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and to determine the origin of the drug apprehended.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will become available to the court in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the series Melrose Place, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California highway patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that around 16.30 hours, Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and when he went back several times he went over his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who notified the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented", so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was ruled out from the first moment, although "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a driving suspect under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison around 19.00 hours although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that must make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making treatment of favor to relatives.
"I for these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said of the action that the party must adopt with the one that until now councilor in the Seville consistory.
However, the leader of IU defended that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which must be thanked to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costume the portrait of "a stunned Spain that was wrong as boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like the one of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than double that of Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Back to start, has stressed what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with which he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to those who does not do casting, for appearing "humiliating" and considering that "part of the office of the director resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de May repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee - of which she won one - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer goes to honor a dancer also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic, "he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in her shows, as she did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally has wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the greatest, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that I have agreed to perform in my work and I’m very honored by it.”
The montage also has the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Flea and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman that developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is one of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less values their work," Bayón says.
The show will start today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They struck me for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Diary of a Newlywed Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Recencased Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aque chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Recencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, it was hard for them to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was very ill.
Still, it's been a blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I've now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of myself or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died in a particularly dark moment, in fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire are left, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and real.
He was the formal enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and earned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead overdose to his homemade and organic food mark.
A whole gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shockwave of admiration was sweeping Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He has left the bar very high for us all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But some people try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was later married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he was surely left over with the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat burger outside the home, if I have a steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race with much I've been.
A height of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I examined, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go sooner.
Which doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go give it their all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the number (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to the race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue when arriving is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by in additions of popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I think that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, due to the chip that I was given that, I imagine, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not go into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At MIT Microsoft’s Emerging Technologies conference, he showed a breakthrough of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) attending what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will attend to him shortly.
All without blue screenshots.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it'll be for less.
A finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It fulfills the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer boots just to run the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but at the end, rather throwing away 2010.
Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that pointed mustache forced that lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's indoor T-shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-speaking call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out from all the others.
First, because of its bombastic name - although familiarly it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out on the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models have as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor T-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them like underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second round for Honda bestseller
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model we must comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter timeframe than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda aims that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decrease in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is confident of the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to commercialize about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership is made in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its heights.
Its length amounts to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Likewise, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-liter mechanics get a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This engine - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous thruster, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it happens to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not stopped him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, win over short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have devised my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection based for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50’s and 60’s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women as they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, right?
I think so but, in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
I liked clothes since I was little; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dig into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that we dancers really like to do our outfits for classes and rehearsals, to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've done not long ago 30, has crisis come into you?
What's going.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I have wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because the body asks me and, in addition, I want to be a young mom; this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are aware of several premieres that you shot last year.
That's right and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, can not be.
I look forward to them premiering 'The Last Minute' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you made your debut on a runway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up a catwalk to model.
I was simply called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I took two pieces from our collection for Mango – was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to make the pine, then also.
To benefit women in the third world, whatever it takes.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Managing Director of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan’s Four-Areas Safety Shield.
This robot intends to reinforce the collision prevention capacity of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s compound eyes, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that lie up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which immediately results in collision prevention.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving intuitive information or logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KBs of memory.
This may surprise, but we’re not talking about gigs of memory, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts that will be introduced to standard cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Drivers repeat of alcohol must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunken vehicle, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was already announced last June and now it is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a course of road re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General’s Office of Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunks take the car again.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in expired air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives each year.
The measure is in line with administrative penalties for two reasons: addressing such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced the use of the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked about the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... She's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 navy soldiers who play the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF he threatened a storm.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room in which the official entourage waits.
At the door of the hotel in which they are staying, one of the four greats of the city, a reporter for Mexican television awaits them.
Timble before you mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or of the messes.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It certainly has useful information, but little detail.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because from buying a better house we don't even talk...
The best gifted award of fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and there is possibly no more exquisite living designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Buttón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the showcase of Mango at number 54 of the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us finish at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart and making her heart of guts, for the recent death of her brother, put on a House costume and some dressings of ELAH, which cut the breath, and the arm of her son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he finished, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both been loaned to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed in a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a friend of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the premises of the palace, but before he showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked for no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And if that were not enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic rhythm imposed by current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from the positions of yoga, the classic massage or the treatments of 'spa', Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing house.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, unplug the mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I do not mean these who wake up very wise telling us something that has happened the day before, but children who speak while asleep.
The first time it happens maybe you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquios.
It is quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you have been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in monthsS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal bedwetting (pee sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be so.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation situations.
It is a little studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him a way out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to turn the child on too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and they have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will encourage the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the somniloquias appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed for several episodes, you should consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to do an interrogation to get information out of it.
You will not get anything, because being asleep you are not conscious to organize your thought.
In addition you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
Football club Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of shortage.
Without having played a good game, the team created many chances of goal and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to touch the squad with a far shot, Illhaeusern quasi was to take "power" and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold were coming to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we would not let the midfielder pass and leave only Riahi in an attacking position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two chances of goal from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But goal scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the cloakrooms a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed down a bit to "compress" his defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major farfulla, the ball passed very close to the transverse field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen angry
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will detour Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find their representatives there.
They pledged to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " it will come with concrete propositions ".
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in diesel prices, which sets a record when reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and English coast, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place to the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday of the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee, which did not sustain their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris", said for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel oil with a price below 0.30 euro per liter.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable "Two Men and a Fate" performer has died from cancer, at 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes saluted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, said the president of Embraer, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would intend to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been taken out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the goal of repaying its US$85 billion loan, according to Sunday’s Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, says this newspaper.
The AIG board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine eventual sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the AIGs intend to separate include its airline leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a loss never seen on the stock exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded on September 17, 2001, that is, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index, the dominant technology index, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded index (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81% (i.e., 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis earlier in the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plane to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he was asking for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which Congress sees unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days will arrive "too late."
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more,” said Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, " every day that passes, the fall of a financial institution " in the United States is announced, Mrs Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, that shows that markets face “not just a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632%, to 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161%, to 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp decline in its listing.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at the price per unit of 25.25 dollars, that is, an amount of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the securities value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion dollars in supplementary with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley said that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley share lost 6.079% to US$ 23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, the American group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, " we thought that the stake had been composed only of ordinary stocks.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimise risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into common stock if they are sold more than 50% above the conversion price, or 47 dollars or so, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley says that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow it to take on investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group nonetheless refused to give clarifications on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he eased his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its listing fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects in its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it raised 15 billion dollars, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, by example of his colleagues and friends, is the third that put to the vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission fulfilled since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28 %, 7 % of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution involves increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving the " development planning " of a country living essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through foreign exchange sent by their emigrants.
Born by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who will be able to do up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and would want a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says John McCain's benefit, while honorable, was "not quite "brilliant" to allow him to stop his drop in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives five points ahead for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, which are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining his adversary’s “naivety” about these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that he ... "accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without bewildering, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"Camcine has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced, yesterday, in front of 20 000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." " Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said Senator Charles Schumer, yesterday, and the influential and Democratic.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of eventual energy independence in the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged the issues that referred to the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euro) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered Sunday afternoon since the closing of the polling stations in central Minsk Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative.
While no outcome had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, has to resign."
Some admit not to have voted: "For what, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers in good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to effect democratic change.
Sanctions, including visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered fair to observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
“We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes,” said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change, stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it's the executive branch.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognise the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures appeared too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
" Have you noticed the election? Interrogate Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two last political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be at most five deputies of the opposition to parliament, those who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central electoral commission are congratulating themselves on their success.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the raptors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon arrival at 15H30 aboard a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell to 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in SUVs in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the far reaches of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since gone from one bond to the other.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, of the special forces," he said without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The Sudanese army said it intercepted during a patrol an off-roader on board which was the kidnappers, who killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an immediately denied claim by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchette culture and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historical sites?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40 000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to search history, preserve with little money lots of private archives and preserve archaeological remains.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument for history and heritage?
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public’s confidence that had seriously been faltered by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980’s.
Faced with this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public poll in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and make recommendations so that such a disaster is not reproduced further.
While Judge Krever was slow to file their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee accomplished this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the public’s confidence,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population was henceforth confident in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary says.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by the blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied had meaning. "
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleite acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleated acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time when the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed to considerably lower the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission of a blood product comes.
I think that you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to regain health without worries, "says the head of the leadership of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, in the example of the western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant, "says Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
" Needs increase because the population is getting older.
Since more aggressive anti-carcinogen treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences on the network of blood donors who regroup on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, 18 years old and who correspond to the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since the current life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate her blood," Francisine Décary slangs.
With a budget of 297 million dollars annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, among which bone grafts, heart leaflets, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing on the bench of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, "says Doctor Décary who describes this program of taking cord blood as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the first division qualifiers of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in summary) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal 90 minute of the game.
After the first goalless half of nowhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, Impacto had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take him 4-3, but the Whitecaps agreed in the 5-4 semifinals, however.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Shortly – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev’s composite unit, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn cheered the attack on a 3-2 gain from the Canadian to the free-shoot barrier against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored one goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory scoring the only goal.
" I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play at the top in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected during today’s by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, in three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plane" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister’s speeches recently, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister nevertheless limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel to immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to Mr. Charest.
This "twice big territory like France", " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, having paused theatrical to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government, "he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he stated speaking of the northwest passage, which will open each year due to the smelting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already begun consultations about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit ", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
Development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly ", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who came before us, we have thought otherwise to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the party’s power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adelard-Godbout Reservoir.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa made by the Bay James our party knew how to forge the future," declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that his commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, drawing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The general council over the weekend supplied the liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problem being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec particularly calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we embraced the great lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned from applying it.
If he had, "we would make progress today" said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want, is that this is not fair a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is back on vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
It's Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what everything about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper says.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are recriminated occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who hits a false justice to assess the defendant’s guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exactions.
We still don’t realize that, but we are witnessing at this time an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the so far minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Sr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Miner Barrick Gold
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate would be to harm whoever dares to hold a position contrary to yours?
The result of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the mine’s almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scaring whoever will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had truly wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally made by changing ideas and not by clubing.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its records and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search equipment that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Possibly Mr. Garver could explain how you can ask for a "public" debate by despising his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold, is that the public holding the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it mostly because it rejects the mining company’s brutal way.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-gagge (chasing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just placed a request regarding the authors of Noir Canada intiminating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Sr.'s surreal speech. Garver, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of college and truth-seeking, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to make a debate about facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and argue about subjects who dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a transparent public debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it intends, it does not feel like making a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is high time for governments to place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30’s.
The new version of the 700 billion-dollar plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It foresees in particular: a better control by the elected of their implementation, of new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed houses the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We made great progress in reaching an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances about Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had run out very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, not forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this limb.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow homeowners to keep their home and the salary of state-surviving business leaders.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, we must not congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, questioned in another network to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it. "
" The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we can overtake.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable."
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers’ money the dubious debts, risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and of provoking a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe we have come out of the stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
With the aim of filing the harshness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take on losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would seek to help it recover money.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 billion can be added if it seems necessary to the president.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
Instead of his help, Washington will get stakes in the relief companies that will earn him dividends in the event of profits and that he will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the freezing procedures that concerned housing obtained with real estate loans according to this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him subject to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House finances committee, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, among whom three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was resigning to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
" This is not money lost, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the English, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take care of all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a lovely smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great broker!
Paul Newman, who died Friday, at 83, from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who was very much like and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic covenants.
Mixed blood often makes children great.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without an outsized ego, the ultimate quality brand.
Because in it was projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, of the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50's studied dramatic art in Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before succeeding in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who served for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified in second place in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also missing with him are the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show business that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sparked vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while their big roles are being treached on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories return to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
Bitter and avenging billiards player in Robert Rossen’s magnificent film The Hustler (1961) will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during his career.
The young people know him mainly thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the curl was curly.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its lazy and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and judges its overly supported performance.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides his true not-so-known pubic sensitivity.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he said, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence"
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an answer against Hollywood excesses, is also hiding.
We will have seen a lot of his face reigning over the bottles of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although he started out as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory ?
Very soon, on October 8, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in full some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of private people.
The method, which was also released by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
For this they obtained the checkouts in the market of the Józsevaros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Region of the Balaton where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he should choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for their consumption and they served as a model to make the invoices they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "studio travel" Sides he chose a brewery.
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided the food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation – later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért – was full of formal and contextual errors.
Well, a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however, the bill included one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center because in the holding of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and the bills were shown, he already knew that these were false documents.
"On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill, a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment bill they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices of the agency.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - they included in the document VAT as well, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also because of formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI, are false. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those bills.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. de Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously issued the bills
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUFs on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious bills.
Likewise, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület
There was no movement of capital either, because then they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to state in their documents this entity.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those who have some link with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the surge of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictional headquarters in Budapest, which was dealing with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations related to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth 14.2 million HUF.
The Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri community company to issue fictional invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
In order for this not to be discovered, they presented the TMA with five dummy invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the defendants will likely report at trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of falsifying bills.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the chief accused of János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this he has not done so until the present.
The question is: what interest does it have?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far superior value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of the Overlapping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
New York University neurologists and economists discovered the neurological - economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI).
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, the increase in gambling is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, economists from the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and its members gambled.
Another group besides that was promised that if they win, they would receive 15 dollars more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group even lost that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists’ hypothesis, members of the group playing “against failure” were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the “winning” group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any economic theory previously existing.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in New York University's faculty of economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world, about five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body moods (sperm, mood of the vagina, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested through poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jauntice appears on the skin and white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Annually one million people die worldwide in cancer and cirrhosis of liver disease caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and even cancer.
Most people are infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical monitoring is very important.
This disease is much more prevalent in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who carry tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check-up as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so that it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in distress due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition from the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Eurozone crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with regard to the Bank, in a sense they can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the bank’s ownership in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a part of its businesses, including especially the activities -mainly insurance - bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The Fortis actions began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85 thousand employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break.
The company’s shares on Friday alone declined by 12 percent, the point being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares decreased with more than two thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank’s leadership charged the sharp decline in Fortis stocks with U.S. market insecurities over the passage of the US package plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, stocks already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors had no need to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s customers so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less to who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in what way it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within the framework of this singular experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same amount of atheists, meanwhile everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate next to academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, the work of 17th-century Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers were hopeful that the Virgin Mary’s spectacle would cause a certain religious mood among the faithful, while choosing Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while watching the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their heart peace reigned."
Looking at the religious-theme picture they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively for, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have for the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday Google can say: he can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above his head; he knows where they spent their vacation, which doctors they visit and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in a system all the information in the world!”
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to treat all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would suit me best?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions apparently so simple until there is enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their navigation on the Network, the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they went when the search ended are precisely stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-enquire what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what may be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom, or rebellion against power.
However, it is an already confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also give third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
Instead, netizens who care about people’s rights in May were relieved when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points in the constitution to supply any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get on the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law approved years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear providing their personal data because they think that their privacy is harmed, their private life when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, the Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same objective.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the program package is free, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of available communication channels, and while the measures of these varies individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young man may have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and may even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, he may also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or the Picsa appear automatically.
We can know numerous cases from which it is clear that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the following morning of the common friends, learns who spent the previous night her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion in his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person’s “online” life is what he shows of himself – this is the definition behind the behavior of our day’s youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid that they can find them, but you can replace Google’s online applications, from text writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly introduced cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers will, however, find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the senior management flatly rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the price of the company’s nursery, considered the unlimited number of food of the employees too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it was ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir to the World: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of Google books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own health system
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel by Cory Doctorow’s popular, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the author's fingerprints of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to informed suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesman of the General Police of Public Order of Borsod province.
The young women recognized the crime that was charged against them, and they are currently accused of being accused of crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency reports, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves free.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant of Ozd’s double murder — a 23-year-old man — has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared long before to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the place of the crime.
The police analyze with an expert to the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech kronor – by one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the supply of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, until now they gave offer the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly profound international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome thinks - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill done in a hurry, whose objective is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor," spoken of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it's more correct to talk about a "second 9/11."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of El Mundo, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing and this will later have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the vote of Congress, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
This threat cannot be ignored - points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw lifeboat belts at wobbly financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, as the Dominoes, more banks fall apart, then neither the new funds, nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is long-term that EU member states put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only more than 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls the Viennian Der Standard, adding that there are increasing real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes like a cumane down the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not have to immediately file hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car mimics bumblebee flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at Japan’s CEATEC, the bumblebees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C-type car robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of the bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
The composite eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the steering by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any system currently existing, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If it weren’t, the vehicle’s robot could not react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and acceleration also the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, which means that they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, much less the storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte, or megabyte memories are needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge the obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, in ten years from now, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, dodging the obstacles in their path.
This very expensive child already has a name
The written version of the 700 billion dollar financial bailout package law that will be applied in several phases has been prepared in order to purchase bad credits from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to Eastern Coast schedules during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the 700 billion-dollar financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the North American Congress, stating that the agreement is only necessary to formalize in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: This program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it’s not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 pm, according to Washington schedule (that is before two in the morning on Monday, according to Central Europe schedule), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization of the year 2008, the North American Congress and then the Senate will vote on Monday.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also held the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all 700 billion dollars to buy bad quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit fund, of bad rating and the destination of another 100 billion dollars depends on the decision of the president.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the 700 billion dollars will be spent after a new congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously purchase bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - reported competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, that even 700 billion dollars can reach to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, its assurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for the help of the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang calls simply gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By directly buying the bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not overstated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts are not going to be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts in order to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation will be in place for the revenues of the CEOs - said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in short they can even make a profit with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars - declared the Republican congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures urged him to be held accountable for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will next year no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that around January 12 the American-Hungarian agreement on the exemption of visas will enter into force - the foreign minister spoke of it in Chicago, before the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion "practically everything depends on the construction in time on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic access and control system."
At the same time he warned that the new system will disappear the entry prize, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing him the Medium Cross with the Hungarian Republic Order of Merit Star and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers from presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties on Sunday secured their support for the administration’s 700 million-dollar banking aid program, while there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several-day marathon-style negotiations, announced in the early hours of Sunday: an agreement was reached on principle on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at fixing the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to lift the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues were brought to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and the advantage of McCain that he had obtained after the Republicans’ convention with the candidacy of Sarah Palin to the vice presidency disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the 700 billion-dollar package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of protection for consumers, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly ... employment is in danger, saving you whole industries and the stability of the entire economy" - he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that "we will all swallow this hard ... but not doing anything is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of finesse and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says the Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-and-white coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now just these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on him.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that was expected for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU scored 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in the rhythm they were very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks precisely the conventional groups of citizens were those who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have high school and the diplomats.
This reduced support for the CSU to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
Vienna's conservative newspaper: "Who with whom? In his article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition matters" - he deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from intruding on its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens on the other hand still do not want to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let see anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left pending the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the position of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed, within the ÖVP itself.
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, deputy of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by government representatives, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of Members of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness among these issues both among Roma and among non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a Roma student begins school, the more likely he or she will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gyps, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school deregregation, for this the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, seeing data from the purchase of medication, often deny signing an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs of protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the prescriptions in all cases unites it to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation dependent on the customer’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the client.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medications are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk increase factor for insurance companies while first-time companies are not.
Special companies were established to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities already force them to this, although they did not receive a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of the laboratory tests and together with the drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that provides the right to the supervisory authority of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another question that such person cannot deny their approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign with him the contract.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made in late October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much criticized duo hinted: they do not cling so much to their positions.
With this they intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup crowded against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the Conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors enters parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role Stoiber also who until now was moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to re-enhance together the CSU which played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is naturally relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s election, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of one hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of doubtful legitimacy, as a result of the modification of the Constitution this time "allow" the entry of some deputies
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give permission to enter Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, when evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition it feels an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to face a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears allowing the entry of even an opponent into that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when seeing the results, rather trying to get voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more people support change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, referring to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that his main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the decomposition of social security that "resembles the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
Russian observers opposed to the opposition politician called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds," so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly to discuss cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso president of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Bearing in view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
This is how they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, and air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also expected, although both sides have great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will cling to its energy and climate programme, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as next year’s climate conference should reach a global agreement and decrease greenhouse gas production by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wish to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, India’s head of government will travel to the French capital, where – at a bilateral meeting – he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive commissions worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
There will be more than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Assets and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting will be followed with the stamp in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the status of publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors progressively decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Brunetta: "From now on he has breakfast before starting work"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi to put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during work hours.
This development has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening up.
This is Reformism," Brunetta again stresses.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found by the employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was the collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast during work hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Public Administration High School
From Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, it means 60 thousand more people to work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to render the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now millions of public employees have come together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the slightest absenteeism of work for causes of illness – writes the association of consummators – the people of ‘lazy workers’ is constantly increasing.
Millions effectively in Italy are the correct and productive public administration employees who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of aggregated economic treatments for illness due to service; the extension of the hourly belts in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is," says the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, a national association mutilated and invalid for the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to families of victims and the awareness of public opinion."
"It has been manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is taken by the many initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini House has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently end."
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive approach, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not, in fact, want this "trend to decline" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that overall it is still done too little to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has stressed - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves further effort - he added - as it concerns communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship planned for the victims of work" and the "assistance reduction to which the system is heading in recent years".
"The goal is to restore the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are accidentd do not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under charge, put hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using wearable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emerging and recently identified health risk (Cssreri) of the EU, published today.
“This scientific opinion – it reads in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I’m concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears irremediably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From scientific evidence – Ue responsibility follows – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts, is raising awareness among connumers and giving this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and take the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that originates.
“Scientists – the Ue executive concludes – confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the member states and stakeholders that measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and time.
In his view, the Ue Scientific Committee makes it clear that users of portable musical devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit in force relative to the maximum noise consented to at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, German gives the Commission for the future of the capital
Today begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the junta and the communal council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bun" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to underline German - it must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March completed the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary finish.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission’s work for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that will be in the degree of carrying out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, their contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that return in return are manifested.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper prospect, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it is absolutely free, not a euro is coastal to the Roman citizens and will serve to make the best minds that squeeze the capital participate and reason."
For German, indeed, "you need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, specifies the mayor of Rome" will not only be limited to the current communal confines but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him to go through independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also does today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he won the nation’s highest office that two governors and five black senators have held!”
They are actually attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly racial in nature and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are the polls; everyone says that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well to the one who will give his vote the American patriot.
One side of the American mentality has been covered to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to cross, whether you're on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things ever said before now, that the success of the black candidate seems almost true.
Yet despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratic is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and they kicked it home in the butt.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases.
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever will take over George W will have a huge duty to perform.
Use, economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
While today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves to be less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not wanted as understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six over ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between the one who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "work security."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “taking it or leaving it.”
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while copywriters can earn up to 10 thousand dollars a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by admission of their own, become "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is inquired for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he has obtained house release, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given an opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself some days ago with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the 700 million dollar salvation plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation yesterday’s New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “those of Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Center and South.
The soul, in fact, has become arrogant with the vow of the one who spoke at first.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Whether in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary revival, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which have, if, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
He who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union that divided as always between different interests and different state strategies fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is reached is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financing resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two invaluable resources, securities in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very close to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we have entered the ever more sophisticated, immaterial technology network, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the most accounts with unimmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters regarding who he is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I arrive at the second novelty that but it foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate economic species relieved with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance always more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far on the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, to have made one’s own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective humors of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also layers with the victory of the American Congress)
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make more difficulty to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially to the extent.
In the face of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is downright exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly is not.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Beating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walking on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have glued a 100 kilo body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckoos, covered in microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal perfect adherence.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "easily peels off the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's engineering school.
WALKING THE WALLS? "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Layers for walking on the walls exactly like the spider man? Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
ANOTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkeley, California, is engaged in finding a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair that self-cleanse from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs, alters their absorption by amplifying or decreasing according to the case, the efficiency with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices are packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already a state under accuse because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal levels.
The same Italian agency of the drug had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to thing is drunk in the case a drug is being assumed such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE GROWL – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicinal products that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, not to be impressed, to ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist, "said the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days Chenbro was going bankrupt, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in ending up in consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers much controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
“I’m shocked and a little upset about how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of European central banking, Krugman is a "high value economist", but also a publicizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, I echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that looks to attract always more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year from the volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, more consistent others are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to the multi-operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is in order to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphical elaboration module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition, for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation CD can also be sent home or work.
And if the issue of the free can be a hook for the dissemination in the houses, it is in business environment that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And there is no shortage of even the realities offered by a training, consultation and assistance service ideal for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video write the corresponding Word; Calc, it is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we reach almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the departure of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third classified and winner of the best shirt of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also them of the Gerolsteiner.
Tests of Kohl blood champions enter among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that he is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the backs of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, claiming the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy as a country of emigrant has only recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for having stolen a cookie box.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Roma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The tendency marked by the Pope that by the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked that the State and the church work together to combat racism."
Steve Fossett's plane found the millionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire missing on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a high plateau at 3000 meters altitude, in the area of the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, at the confine between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is typical of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The millionaire, 63, has been presumed dead in February.
The American transport safety office (Ntsb) has announced that some hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is typical of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far with the confine of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents by the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, the sixth tentative, he had become the first Man to complete the world turn in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the turn of the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his record, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters of height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv outside of schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a novelty window in this sector.
Own for the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented form of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car leaves the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will it be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy are now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what had come out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been turned down by the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Fortunately!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those a few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this mode," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That is why "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National Party in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is to say the secret service, which is responsible for the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria no is a challenge..."
This is the thought (expressed in an inachapious way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks ago the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was previously of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public safety where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not harmed to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans who have been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the attacks are attributed in the countries in which the event happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles of Mameli’s hymn: they are also not a trick, but if they allow they are not educated either...”
Students victim of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of the tenants, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to support - explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents."
In addition, in most cases, rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type, unregistered, no fee limit, related sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary, which, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for a single one.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Bologna Square) they ask you approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is economics only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed they serve you 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250/350 euro, at least 350 for an individual.
in smaller cities prices are lower in absolute endings, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic theaters
The historic cinemas close favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without movie theaters in a blind city, it's like an eyeless face."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great methicons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey theaters in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are above all the theaters of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the one responsible for its disappearance is the addition of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are the same that have registered the largest number of new methycone cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 is in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methicons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the state’s previous debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the single cinema room is in the historic center that on the periphery.
Among the rules provided there are means of tax facilitation in favor of managers and advantages for the public in ends of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore” and I hope that other cities follow Bologna’s example by putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the methicons, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that for me was always important: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale de via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.
The link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
It is heavy to accuse that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the boss’s namesake, already convicted of mafia criminal association and compensation for 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral standard, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the interior of the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrís regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.’
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cut of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been supplemented by the commission to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in cause the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental intercepts made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the availability to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families."
When the energy is born of the waves, the greats go down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70’s along with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil give the sector momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of waves from the sea.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy, it is always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the commission for American energy, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, if you consider that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the energy path that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boas system attached to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders to the inside of them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping center and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long customer cast waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electrical energy, merits at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coasts, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
