Have you ever imagined what to call or name someone who has no name or last name?
Che!
You!
That word that identifies us so much to the Argentines, "che".
But I'm thinking of someone else who doesn't have the name or last name.
I'm thinking of that someone who lost his first and last name, that his first name and last name, his identity disappeared.
Now in Argentina, people are disappearing.
In the world, now right now, thousands of people disappear.
Some are missing who are alive, as a result of child trafficking, baby theft, human trafficking, illegal adoptions.
Others are missing who have died: kidnappings, wars, narco-violence, terrorist attacks, natural accidents and others not so natural.
You need to return your identity, rewrite your first and last name.
Because we all have an identity, we have an individuality, an identity of individual, affective, family, cultural, group, country, but we also have a genetic identity.
It is written in our genes our identity.
Our genome, the human genome, is made up of four letters that are repeated 3000 million times.
Amazing!
But we're almost the same.
Almost the same!
To be exact, our genome is 99.9% identical among us.
Only 0.1% of our genome allows us to distinguish or identify ourselves.
Now, 0.1% of 3000 million letters is no less than three million letters and that is a number.
You can write some books with three million letters.
And that is what it is, of, using the letters of our genome, to rewrite the letters of the name and surname of those who lost their identity.
How do we do it?
Using genetics, comparing.
To identify is necessarily to compare.
To compare a father and a son, to know if they are linked in that kinship, I have to compare them.
And know that there is a proportion of those letters that they have in common according to that kinship.
In the 80’s, I was working in the Hospital de Clínicas, on the genetics of transplants, looking for maximum genetic compatibility between donors and organ recipients to avoid graft rejection.
And you'll wonder, and what does that have to do with identity?
It has to see and a lot.
And how much!
Because our body, our immune system, is deeply xenophobic.
It self-recognizes itself as such and tolerates and rejects all the strange.
And that's why we reject a virus, a bacterium, how much more are we going to reject an entire organ.
That’s why we were looking for those compatibility, to avoid those rejections.
But also those genes allowed us, precisely because we did it between related relatives, analyze and establish kinship bonds.
We had a problem in the 80’s: we needed living cells from the two people we were going to compare, we couldn’t analyze a bone.
That was a stumbling block.
But a decade later a revolution came to the laboratories: now we could compare molecules.
We could extract molecules from a living, or dead, cell and compare them.
Then we took a step forward and could then identify a dead cell inside a body or a bone moiety.
And we gained some experience.
A decade later, precisely in 2003, something happened that changed my life, largely professionally and also motivation.
A group of women and men arrived in Córdoba, anthropologists and anthropologists, from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team who had been walking through Argentina, exhuming graves, looking for causes of death, analyzing those bones, trying to identify them and restore them to families.
They came walking not only in Argentina, but in many countries of the world.
And they came to Córdoba to exhume a massive grave of the municipal cemetery of San Vicente.
A mutual friend gathered us at his house.
What did we do?
What many Argentines do when we get together: we ate a roast and there was wine too.
And so, having a few glasses of wine, I was shocked by the stories that these anthropologists told me because the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team is an NGO that works on cases of universal human rights violations trying to identify people.
They told me stories from all countries, but there, in that meeting, in that roast with that wine, we realized that they were in a stumbling block, there was a deadlock, they needed to incorporate a new technology into this complex process of identification and it was genetics.
So, we think about joining forces and doing something together.
I remember that at that moment we considered, we tried with the worst preserved rest of the St. Vincent, with the most degraded, more deteriorated rest.
If we do well with that, we're sure to do well with the others.
And we did very well.
And the first identification of a skeletal remnant of the dictatorship in Argentina, in the stretch of San Vicente in Córdoba.
That filled us with joy and we said, "Let's put a lab" and that's how it was done.
We set up a genetics lab where there are young guys who are working, I know, a lot.
And we started walking, we called family, we started crossing letters to rewrite names.
But not only in Argentina, because in Argentina we produced some identifications, others more from the cemetery of San Vicente, of the center of torture and death of "La Perla", the identification of some of the founding mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had been thrown into the sea and that the sea had returned them.
We also went for a walk the road that they were walking: Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, where there were also dictatorships and names and identities disappeared.
And further north, in Central America, El Salvador, the war of the 80’s, and even further north, in the current Mexico, where thousands of migrants disappear every year from many countries, which crossing Mexico, want to achieve reach the dream of the northern country.
Also on other continents, Africa, for example, the South Africa that imprisoned Mandela.
And in Asia.
It seems all wonderful, doesn't it?
Everything went well.
But it's not.
Many times we stay in the middle.
Many times we have the remains, but so many years have passed that the relatives are no longer there.
And other times we have the relatives, but the remains are not found.
And other times, even having the remains, they are so deteriorated that we cannot decipher the letters to compare them with the relatives.
That really creates great frustration.
I’m sure you know a highly known, very famous, popular TV series: CSI New York, Los Angeles, Miami.
In those series, the researchers, in hours, days, solve some very difficult cases.
That's not true, that's fiction.
The reality is different.
We call that "CSI effect" because they generate a distorted picture of the complex identification process.
Most worryingly, they don’t just do it about people popularly, but some government authorities also think it’s so easy.
They are all models.
The reality of our... (Laughter) it's a little different.
(Laughter) (Whistle in the public) (Laughter) (Applause) I'm remembering about four or five years ago, I had to participate in a convocation that we had made in Mexico to relatives.
It was a call to a number of families who came to donate their blood samples to make a blood bank and compare the data with the number of pits that were being discovered.
It was a very solemn atmosphere.
The relatives were serious, they came to donate their blood samples.
At one point, I finished taking a sample from a mother.
He stopped.
I was going to reach out to give it to him.
I looked at her, she was little, very native, dressed in her typical costume.
I reached out to her and she took it with both of them and brought her here like this and said, "Doctor, please find me."
(Sighs) That request is a mandate.
For that request-mandate is that it is worth insisting and insisting on those complex cases that we cannot resolve.
Obsessively insist to try to produce a new identity, to be able to rewrite a name again, return it to a family, end the years of waiting, uncertainty, anguish and so that that little mother can meet again with her son, even though her son is dead.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Ovation)
When I was five and I was starting to read, my dear grandfather Carlos Felipe gave me an adventure book.
"The Microbe Hunters" by Paul de Kruif.
In its chapters were Leeuwenhoek, Spallanzani, Koch, the bacillus, Pasteur, men who with rudimentary microscopes sought to defeat the invisible enemy.
The book did not awaken in me the vocation for medicine or chemistry, but my passion for history.
And, as a frequent traveler to the past, I wanted to tell you something about the pandemics that hit humanity.
We could talk about the fierce anger of the second half of the 19th century, or the smallpox that cost so much to dominate.
But there are two pandemics that were very marked by their fatal consequences.
In the 14th century, the Black Death, caused by a lice that moved in rats.
It began in Asia and from there it passed to Venice, the most cosmopolitan port of its time.
That's how he got into Europe.
The death was between 25 and 50 million.
From every four Europeans to one was taken by the plague.
The numbers in Asia were quite similar.
Closer in time, in the 20th century, the century of flus, we had in 1918 the Spanish flu.
Spanish flu that began in the U.S. with American soldiers preparing to go to the end of the First World War and that infected the populations of the ports of France where they embarked.
From there it spread all over the continent.
It started in the U.S. and came to Europe for France.
Why do we call it the Spanish flu?
Well, that was a "fake news."
The government and the press of Spain decided to face evil by putting statistics on the surface.
For that sinceration of the data and the numbers they ended up being pointed out as responsible for something that did not correspond to them.
At that time one in five infected died.
Look, in World War I, between 10 and 30 million people died.
Universal flu killed 50 million.
The world population declined between 2.5% and 5% because of this pandemic.
We talked about cholera, smallpox, the black plague, the universal flu and we could also add the yellow fever, of 1871, which hit the cities of Corrientes and Buenos Aires.
What did they all have in common?
That when we were attacked we were not warned.
We were not ready.
To top it off, in many cases it was not known where the contagion came from.
Therefore, the responses and reactions were not effective in countering evil.
What did we learn from all those fatalities?
Something very important, that the danger of the virus is enhanced with disinformation.
I explain them to you.
In the 14th century, instead of dealing with rats and lack of hygiene, it was argued that the sinful lifestyle of many had unleashed divine wrath.
In the 20th century, instead of showing the true causes of that flu, reality was distorted and the bug was out of control.
That way he spread across five continents.
Therefore, we may have learned once that we must handle ourselves with the truth.
As much as it hurts.
Another great teaching at that time was that we will have to stay on guard even after the storm passes.
Because there have always been second and third waves that have taken the unsuspecated.
But above all, we can venture wonderful times of growth.
Because after the Black Death the Renaissance emerged.
Because after the universal flu came the 1920’s, the most fruitful and avant-garde of all time.
Yes, at the end of the tunnel, the sun awaits us.
Thanks.
I have two passions: one, football.
I'm a megafan, let's see if you guess what team?
(Laughter) Of course I'm a Real Madrid megafan.
I'm also a goalkeeper on the Villanubla futsal team.
The other passion is: computers, video games and programming, which is what I come to talk about today.
When it comes to playing, the children drive us crazy the Wii, the PSP, the Nintendo.
We always try to earn some extra games, finishing homework first, ordering our room, whatever by moving to the next level or exceeding our previous score.
One day I thought: What if instead of just playing those games I could create my own screens, heroes and bad guys, punches and pirouettes, extra lives?
Impossible?
No, no.
A child my age can do it.
While new technologies are everywhere and the elderly use them for older things, to see... -- computers on board cars (although my parents sometimes keep missing out), mobiles, check mail, send messages, buy, surf the Internet -- we children use them to play, that we are children for and that is what we like the most.
But we all know that we, the children, are given much better, how to say it?, those devices of the devil than many older people, perhaps because we are not afraid to touch them, to experiment with them, to see what is here or to spoil them, since then there are the parents to fix everything.
(Laughter) This curiosity that we children have helped me to be the creator of my own games and I realized that I could learn by playing and playing learning.
I could experiment, create, share, understand and reason how things are made to then use it with what we were studying.
And it turns out that all that I was learning is what the elders call "creative computing."
Once I was told that programming is like a play: we have our stage where our actors are who will perform with each other as we tell them, we can disguise them to get animations or add images, sounds, etc. You will think: it looks very good, but a child alone, in his room, programming, is not very social to say.
But it's much more.
It is a public and open community worldwide, to which we can belong and where we can publish our programs or download the programs already made to play with them, see how they have done them, modify them or improve them.
Currently, in this community there are more than 10 000 shared programs, and to it belong children, not so children, and teachers from schools, institutes and universities.
I was becoming more and more passionate.
I made new friends with whom I shared creations, and I was thinking that if I taught it to school children, they could also enjoy it as I did.
In addition, programming also helped me to learn in a more fun way what we were giving in school.
So I was clear about it.
Last year, when we were giving the bones of the human body in class, it occurred to me to make a question and answer game, which is this: (Video) I will show you this game that I made about the bones of the human body for my school, when we were giving it last year, in which the human body asks you where its bones are.
We give to the green flag, we put it on the big screen to make it look better, and it says: where is the jaw?
You have to respond with the right number, if it is 10, 11, 1, 2, the 3... because you answer with the 10 that is the right one and it says: "well" but if you answer badly it says: "ua, ua, ua".
The sounds I have recorded and I have added them to the game too, and I have made that there are successes and failures, that here I put the numbers of the successes and the failures in order to make competitions with my friends to see who knows better the bones of the human body.
(Applause) I had so much fun programming it and it helped me so much to learn it that I told my teacher and asked if we could see him in class, that I wanted to show it to everyone.
And so it was.
We organized a day in which I taught those projects and more to my classmates and I taught them that they too could do it just like I had.
As it could not be otherwise, they loved it.
Children and teachers liked so much that this year we have founded the programming club "El paramo de Villanubla", where we are already 26 children who enjoy and program programs individually or in team.
Now I'm preparing this game about space: (Video) I'm going to show you this game that I've made about the planets of the solar system with the video sensor, in which you have to hit the head of the planets so that they do not fall into the sea.
We put it on the big screen.
I have put faults and successes and here is the sea.
The planets are falling and you point towards the camera, you move and you give them.
When you give them, you change the planet by its name and say it, and it adds a success.
But when you don't give them the sound of water sounds and add a fault.
Well, I think you've seen how it works.
(Applause) What's very cool?
Well, I did it and that's cooler.
In addition I will pass it to the 5-year-olds of my school who are doing a program on the planets of the solar system and surely with it they are all learned and that makes me feel happier because I know that my games serve for more things than to have fun to myself.
But it's not the first time I've done anything for the kids in my school.
As my parents saw that I liked it so much and I did so well with the studies, when I turned 7 they gave me one thing that when I saw it I said: what is this?
Some wires?
And they said, "With those wires you're going to be able to do magic."
And they were right and I'm going to prove it today.
It was a plate called Makey Makey that when connected with a cable to the computer you could click more cables to things as original as gummies, plasticine, fruits, pencil graphite, water or, just touching them, make programs and games work magically.
I told Marga, the 4-year-old boys teacher at my school and asked me if we could do a special project about the music and instruments of an orchestra.
The children and their teachers would be responsible for making the cardboard and rubber eva instruments, while I had to do the necessary programs for those instruments to come to life and sound really.
So I told Juanje, a friend of mine, and between the two of us got to work.
We found it a very interesting project, but it was a very difficult challenge because we had to make very young children listen to us, other children.
When we had everything prepared we put together all the children of the childhood cycle and taught them how their instruments really sounded.
We even taught them that they also had music inside.
It was amazing!
The little ones behaved great.
We organized them in shifts so that everyone could play their instruments.
Really, they looked at us as if we were magicians who with simple cables and a computer had left children and adults speechless.
Well, you want to see how we did it?
Well, I'm going to prove it to you next.
Today I brought here some of those instruments, which, by the way, I thank my school for leaving them to show you a little bit of that magic, and what any child could do with a little imagination, some cables and a computer.
To play this super piano made by four-year-olds I have to take off my shoes.
My feet are clean, huh!
(Laughter) Let's see if this song sounds to you.
(Music) (Applause) And now I'm going to show you how water can make more sounds than it does when it comes out of the tap.
I will dedicate this song to my grandmother that for next week will be her birthday.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) And then I'm going to need four volunteers because here and now we're going to see what they sound like.
Let's see, you four of them are very close.
(Laughter) (Applause) Get out there, you take this one and you take this one.
Let's see which instrument you sound (Noise) Go, you sound like a noise!
(Cymbal sound) And you to some saucers.
No, you don't sound.
(Laughter) (Drum sound) You sound like a drum.
And you, let's see what instrument you sound like.
(Horse linquer sound) Oh, if we've sneaked a horse!
(Laughter) (Applause) I hope you liked everything I told you.
Do you see how I didn't cheat you?
You imagine, create and share, and all with some cables, a little imagination and a computer.
Cheer up boys and girls!
Stop being just game players and become creators of stories, games, programs, musical projects...
There is no limit, only that of our imagination.
But do not stay there, show it to the world, send it to the web so that we are more and more those who enjoy, not only playing, but also knowing that we, the children, can also decide how we want things to be done.
And to you, the parents, I ask you, please, to set up programming workshops in the schools so that no child is left without learning all this.
It is important for your children.
(Applause) And never forget and always believe that there is nothing impossible, it all depends on our effort and desire to overcome us, and although we are very small we also have many things to teach others.
Thank you very much for your attention.
See you soon.
(Applause)
Without identity, we cannot be in society.
The first thing people with disabilities lose when they are born is their identity.
They are labeled, renamed, by a diagnosis that does not speak of the person.
Deposing identity is the beginning of a series of humiliations according to culture, context, circumstances, which is repeated throughout the history of humanity.
And the school reproduces what the Spartans when asked, in the presence of a student with disabilities, what does he have?
But to name is an act of resistance.
And so the body becomes a sign.
And our children and our young people can be recognized.
So, the right question is who is it?
The school has the power to name.
The school returns identity.
It has the power to return the status of person.
As simple as that: School dignifies.
So, if we dream of an inclusive society, the key is in school.
(Applause) (Vitors)
I have a daughter who is 13 years old, but in 2012, when it was the financial collapse, that all the stock markets fell in the world and all that, I had five less than now, I would be eight, nine years old.
And we were watching the news, we were having lunch and watching the news and a type of peeled tie appeared, a journalist who always gave bad news, was the one who predicted the tsunami and a plane fell, and that day said: "Last moment, the bag collapsed all over the world."
And my daughter looked at me like that and I got pale.
And the guy followed, he says, "The face value of the bond soars by not being able to sustain debt obligations."
And my daughter was looking at me.
(Laughter) "Investment banking collapsed," he said, "shareholders are committing suicide."
And my daughter opened her big eyes and so did I.
Obviously I got scared because something serious was going on.
And then Nina, my daughter, who always asked me what the tsunami is, what is the plane that fell and was easy to explain about the tsunami: it is the epicenter of a thing in the sea that the Filipinos later die, is simple.
(Laughter) He asked me, "What happened now, Dad, is it serious?"
And I realized I had no idea how to explain to a guy what that was.
An earthquake is easily explained, but how do they explain to a baby the collapse of the financial system?
You can’t explain it because it’s intangible, more than anything.
But since I'm "hard head" and in free time I'm a writer too, I set out to do it, so I wrote a children's story.
And the next day, when we were watching the news back and I was wondering again, I told him a story I want to share with you. I told Nina that day that there was once a very quiet village and that there was a boy named Pepe, the protagonist, who lived in the house farthest from the village.
One afternoon, Pepe went for a walk and held him thirst.
When he returned home, he opened a bottle of wine and, while drinking the wine, discovered one thing no one had ever discovered: there were no bars in the village.
There was not a bar.
Pepe thought that if he opened a bar, he could make others happy, giving them to take, and also thought he could earn some currency.
And he was happy with the idea of opening a bar.
That afternoon, his friend, Moncho, passed through Pepe's house and gave him a good name for the bar.
And it is already known that when a late-night idea has a name, that idea is already beginning to walk.
Then Pepe made a list of needs to open the first bar in the village.
Nina looked at me with her eyes open, the story was fine until now.
Pepe realized that you had to buy tables, chairs, glasses, paint, a palenque so that the customers of the bar put their horses and could go in to drink.
And he took out the bills and all that was going to cost him about 10 000 coins.
Of course, Pepe didn’t have 10 000 coins because he was poor, but overnight he came up with a way to get those 10 000 coins.
Pepe cut 1000 papers and wrote in each paper the phrase: "Coming soon, Bar de Pepe"; 1000 times wrote that.
And on Sunday, after Mass, he went to the town square dressed in his best suit and said to all the neighbors in the square: "Dear neighbors, I will open a bar on the outskirts of the village."
Everybody looked at him.
"What a good idea!"
Some said.
Pepe felt very good with everyone's attention and then fanned the 1000 papers cut out and said, "This is important, Nina," I said, "Each of these 1000 papers costs 10 coins."
The neighbors looked at him.
"The one who buys me a piece of paper is going to have to keep it because in a month, when I open my bar, I'm going to pay 12 coins for every piece of paper that you give back to me."
Then there were whispers in the whole square and Moncho, who was the fool of the people, asked, "Stop, Pepe!
But doesn't it cost 10 coins each paper?
Why are you going to give away two more coins later?"
And Pepe said, "It's not gifting, Mocho, it's compensating.
I’m going to compensate with two more coins to those who help me fulfill my dream, which is to open a bar.”
Then the mayor, who was out there, came up and said, "It makes sense!
It makes a lot of sense.
All right, Pepe!"
And Ernesto, who was rich and understood business, said, "To me, the idea seems very good to me."
And the priest Ricardo, taking some coins from below his cassock, said: "It's a very Christian idea!
I want some of your little papers."
And they all started buying Pepe's papers.
That way so simple, and in just one morning, Pepe got the silver to open his bar.
Among all the neighbors they bought the 1000 papers.
"I bought him two," Sabino said, who was poor, but optimistic.
"I bought him 36" shouted Quique who was greedy and haughty.
Pepe went home with 10 000 coins in his backpack and fell asleep thinking of his dream: opening a bar.
The next day it was Monday and Pepe traveled to the city and bought wood to build a counter and bought paint, returned home and got to work.
He did not pass through the village square in the next four weeks.
I mean, I told Nina, Pepe didn't hear about the disaster he was going to arm himself because of his little papers.
At that moment of the story I stopped and stared at my daughter to see if she was understanding the story.
You always have to "test" the metaphors with the guys, especially when they're complex ideas, and she said, "Dad, this has nothing to do with what the peeled man of the 'tele' said, but he's good, I continued."
(Laughter) Then I told him.
I told him what happened in town for the first week.
That Monday, the square was full of people, much more than on a normal Monday.
Many neighbors had spent the entire night cutting their own papers because they had also, they had, they had projects that they could not fulfill due to lack of coins.
Some papers said, "Shortly, Ice Cream of Horace."
Other papers said, "Very soon, Carmen's Hairdresser."
And there were even some papers written by Moncho with misspellings, which said, "At the end of the month, I'll make for the moon."
(Laughter) Suddenly, the neighbors would get on the streetlights of the square so that the other neighbors could buy those papers.
They climbed to the fountain to exchange papers for coins.
Tuesday was even worse and on Wednesday you could no longer walk through the square of the "quilombo" that there was.
The mayor had to put order and enabled a closed place in the municipality so that the neighbors could meet to exchange papers without destroying the square.
This small venue opened on Thursday and was baptized with the name of "the hall of the papers".
And so it was that on Friday, all those who had a project had already obtained the necessary coins to carry it out and had gone to work.
Horace was already looking for milk, cream, ice for his ice cream parlor, Pepe was already sawing the wood for the bar counter.
Carmen sharpened the scissors for her brand-new hairdresser and Moncho had bought two skinny horses to make trips to the Moon.
(Laughter) Only a group of neighbors who had never in life had ever come up with any interesting project had occurred in the paper room.
The only thing these neighbors had were other people’s papers.
One of these neighbors, Ramón, complained loudly: "Caramba!"
he said.
"Now I need coins to buy cigars and I don't have.
A few days ago, I changed my last 10 coins for a Pepe paper and now I need to smoke."
"The same thing happens to me," Luis said, "I want to go to the movies, I don't have a coin."
The complaints were increasing until Sabino, who was cunning, raised his little paper and said: "I mean, guys, within three weeks, Pepe is going to pay 12 coins to the one who returns this little paper that I bought to 10.
I sell my paper right now for eight coins!”
And the others looked at him, said, "Oh!"
"I deal" Ernesto said he was rich, but he wanted to be even richer and took the paper out of his hands, for eight coins.
Ramón and Luis also sold their papers for less than 10 coins and, while one ran to buy cigars and the other went to the cinema, the other neighbors saw that this was a new way of doing business, although never in life would have thought of an idea of truth.
Some got on the chairs, others to the tables.
They began to offer what they had and even the priest Richard came from the sad church and said: "Friends, the day that Moncho put his papers on sale, I, who am a Christian, I bought him a few because he is a fool.
Now Moncho sells them to 7 coins and says he's going to return 20 coins, but he's dumb and wants to make trips to the Moon.
I now need coins to fix the bell tower and no one wants to buy me Moncho's little papers."
"I'm sorry, Father Ricardo," they all said, "we can't buy.
How's that boy going to go to the moon?"
Then the priest left the room with the papers of Moncho, head down, and it was the first time in many years that no one was helping him repair the church.
And so the first week happened.
Then I looked at Nina, who told me, "Now it seems to me that it starts to look like what the TV peel said."
And I say, "Sure!
In the real world the paper room is called the stock exchange, while the papers can have two names.
They can be called ‘bonds’, in some countries, in other countries they are called ‘obligations’.
The 12 coins that Pepe will pay when the bar works, or the 20 coins Moncho says he will pay when he makes trips to the Moon, are called ‘bonus face value.’”
And Nina looked at me like that.
(Laughter) She opened her big eyes because she understood the girl, eight years.
Then I told him what happened the second week in town.
I told him that Pepe's house no longer looked like a house, Pepe's house looked like something else.
In the dining room there was a wooden bar, the bathroom had been converted into two bathrooms, one for ladies, one for gentlemen.
The walls were half painted navy blue and Pepe was very happy with the progress of his bar.
As he had not yet gone to the village, Pepe, he still did not know that the life of his neighbors was a "quilombo" of papers that were and went changing in price and owner.
Even the mayor, after talking to his secretary, decided to join the new fashion.
One Tuesday morning, the mayor went out to the balcony with a megaphone and said: "Neighbors, the square was damaged after the furor of the papers.
I need to raise funds to fix the wreckage of the streetlights, to renovate the fountain and to buy me a motor car.
From this moment on, I put up for sale 1000 official papers."
"How many coins do they cost?"
Sabino asked.
"No coins!"
The mayor said, "My little papers cost a horse.
When the fountain pours water, when the streetlights give light again and I have a motor car, I'm going to return two horses per paper.
The official papers are on sale from now on, they run that they are over."
The mayor’s papers were sold in record time.
Everyone in the village handed over their horses to the mayor and, from that day on, the tasks began to be done on foot.
Meanwhile, the exchange of papers continued to increase and no longer reached the pencils to score who owned what.
Some papers were very desired, for example, those of Pepe who worked day and night in the realization of his bar, but to other papers no one wanted them, for example, those of Moncho because his artifact to make trips to the Moon, for the moment, only consisted of two horses and a cart.
No one thought that would start to take flight.
Ernesto, the wealthy neighbor who had bought many papers during the first week, now wanted to get Moncho’s papers off.
And, as he also had Pepe's papers, he invented something great that he baptized: "the wads of Ernesto".
They were closed packages with 100 papers of all colors.
For example, there were 10 papers from the bar of Pepe up, 20 papers from the ice cream shop of Horacio al medio and 70 papers of the lunar project of Moncho below, without anyone seeing them.
On Thursday of the second week, Ernesto’s wads had great success among the neighbors who were looking for like crazy papers from Pepe or the mayor, but on Friday, Quique discovered the trick and said: “Beware, neighbors, beware!
Ernesto’s wads sometimes come with papers from Pepe or the mayor at the top and that’s fine, but at the bottom of the package there are many Moncho papers that will never in fucking life make any trip to the Moon.
So before buying Ernesto's wads, seek my advice.
My fee for each council is two currencies."
(Laughter) Since then, paper buyers have always consulted Quique before buying wads from Ernesto.
Ernesto and Quique, who had been friends for many years, stopped talking to each other forever.
And so the second week passed.
At that point, Nina was almost an expert on this whole thing.
I explained that in the real world the mayor's official papers are called "public debt securities."
I explained that Ernesto's wads are called "debt obligations", while Quique's house, the place where the neighbors go to know whether or not they trust Ernesto's wads, is called "investment bench".
Then I told Nina that, when the third week began in the village, some projects were almost finished and, on the other hand, others were still in diapers.
Pepe only needed to nail the palenque so that the horses of the neighbors grazed outside the bar.
Horacio had managed to beat milk and fruits for his ice cream parlor and it was no longer for him to bring ice bars from the city.
Instead, Carmen had not yet found a good place to install her hairdresser, although she already had dozens of sharp scissors.
What about Moncho?
Poor Moncho.
Their horses were increasingly thin and sad, though they were brushed day and night, and it didn’t seem like their artifact could fly in less than a week.
Neighbors who had Moncho or Carmen papers were restless and could no longer sell them to anyone.
Until Quique came along with a great idea.
"Hey!"
Quique said.
"The ones who still have Moncho's papers, don't worry.
I can sell you "Quiet quiet" for those papers.
"What is that?
", Sabino asked that he had many Moncho papers.
"Very easy," Quique said.
"Whoever has Moncho's papers pays me two coins every night at the end of the month and if Moncho fails to make trips to the Moon, I pay the 20 coins promised by Moncho."
"Even though Moncho fails?"
They all asked.
"Even if it's wrong!
", Quique said.
"Tremendous idea!
", Sabino said, "so we will feel much more tranquility and we will be able to buy more papers from the fool of the people."
"That's why my idea is called 'Quique's quiet,'" Quique said.
And many neighbors started paying Quique two coins a night to secure Moncho's project.
In the middle of the euphoria for these new ideas, no one in the village noticed that the mayor had never fixed the streetlights or the fountain of the square.
The mayor had kept only a part of the promise: he had escaped the village with a motor car.
It was all I had done.
And the only horses left in the village were those of Moncho.
Everyone else had taken the mayor.
The secretary, who had been the mayor’s right-hand man and knew the scam from the start, decided to do something so that no one would discover the absence of his boss.
And his idea was great: He brought to the paper room a blackboard and began to put a note, from one to ten, to each project.
The bar of Pepe put an eight, to the hairdresser of Carmen put a five, to the ice mill of Horacio, a seven.
The vehicle to make trips to the Moon of Moncho put a two and, becoming distracted, the reforms of the mayor's square put a nine with fifty.
"What do these numbers mean?
", Sabino asked.
And the secretary said: "These are the possibilities of concreteness of each project.
It's to help, I do it for you." And so the third week passed.
At this point, I explained to Nina that in the real world, Quique’s idea of offering peace of mind about Moncho’s papers is called “debt default insurance” and the great slate where the secretary puts a note to each project, in the real world, is called “qualifying agencies,” which are sometimes unintentionally wrong and sometimes wrong wanting to want.
Then Nina asked me if Pepe had finally managed to open his bar because we were already in the fourth week and I told him the end of the story.
The end of the story reads like this: When the fourth week came and the month was fulfilled, Pepe got up very early and walked quietly to the village.
From a distance, the facade of his bar was seen with the luminous sign at full rag.
The bar was called "The Moon", as Moncho had baptized it on the first day.
Now only the neighbors were missing to arrive on horseback, with their throats dead of thirst.
Pepe walked the five leagues to the village putting signs on all the trees along the way: "Bar La Luna, open every night."
Every poster he put on, he went away and was proud looking at the poster.
However, when he arrived at the village square, he did not understand anything that was happening.
He thought he was wrong on his way and was in a different village.
It seemed that the war had passed through that people.
The streetlights and the fountain of the square were shattered, there was not a single horse in the streets and the neighbors walked in the round talking alone.
"What happened here?"
Pepe asked Horacio when he saw him.
"Oh!
Pepe," Horacio said, crying.
"Oh, Pepe.
Everyone went crazy with the papers, with mine, with those of Carmen, with yours, with everyone.
Suddenly, there began to be more papers than coins and the mayor escaped from the village.
Then there were no coins anymore.
The horses later disappeared.
Ernesto's wad sellers went bankrupt.
Quique’s resales could not pay anyone and escaped into the night.
We're broke, Pepe."
"What about your ice cream project?"
Pepe asked.
"What about Carmen's hairdresser?"
"No, my thing was a failure," Horacio said.
"There are no horses to go get ice in the city and the ice cream melts.
And Carmen has no customers.
Everyone's ripping their hairs off alone.
What do they want hairdresser for?"
Pepe was silent, he couldn’t believe what they were telling him.
Then Horatius said, "Oh, for God's sake!
I need something strong."
And Luis said, "I'm a dry throat too."
And Sabino asked, "Pepe, did you open the bar you wanted to open or not?"
And others also came to ask about the bar.
Pepe then discovered that, without a horse, no one would ever be able to go to his bar on the outskirts of the village and also understood that he could never return the 10 000 coins to anyone.
And then he saw Moncho in the middle of the square.
The two skinny horses of Moncho were the only remaining animals and dragged three chariots, with two wheels each, in the form of a train.
To those cars were going up many neighbors and others were doing a long line, waiting to climb.
"Moncho!"
Pepe asked, "Where are all these people going?"
And Moncho said, "Where is it going to be?
To your bar!
To The Moon."
Pepe saw a sign hanging on the broken fountain that read, "Moncho makes trips to the Moon.
Departures: a coin.
Return: Free."
"But Moncho!"
Pepe asked, "Did you know that everyone was going to run out of horses?"
"No," said Moncho, "I just know one thing: I know that people can go to a bar on horseback, but no one can go back drunk and riding a horse."
"And since I don't take, I thought my business might be to take them and bring them from the moon."
Then Pepe hugged Moncho, got on the first car and shouted, "Let's all go to the Moon!
Free drinks the first night," and the whole town went up and clapped.
Nina even applauded the end of the story.
And then I told my daughter to be careful because in the real world the stories of the Pepes who try to open bars, or the stories of the Monchos who want to make trips to the Moon and no one understands them, are almost always projects that usually have a happy ending as in children's stories.
Because in the middle appear Quiques, mayors appear, Ernestos and secretaries appear and always spoil everything.
But when some of these projects do work, I told my daughter to finish, when these projects work, when something magical happens and they work, they are called "dreams" and are usually wonderful.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
(Applause)
They probably remember this image of Chancellor Angela Merkel taking a selfie with a refugee.
This image and other similar people raised blisters in the German parliament and in many European parliaments, putting the European Union in check.
From the beginning there was no consensus among the German population in the face of such a flood of refugees from the Middle East, the road to Europe.
The welcoming culture fostered by Angela Merkel from the beginning was not always valued by everyone.
From the beginning there were people who supported her and other people who did not.
People who do not support her today, are increasingly, there are more and more detractors, and this will take its toll on Angela Merkel, obviously.
I do not want to go into detail about the political future of Angela Merkel, but I would like to mention that she, for me, is one of the political people today who has a moral authority despite her mistakes, which most politicians today lack.
This is a graph showing the number of refugees who entered Germany over the past year.
The first group is from Syria, followed by the group that came from Iraq, and the group that came from Afghanistan.
According to a UNICEF report published just two weeks ago, half of the people fleeing the war are minors.
The speech against refugees is well known: "They will Islamize us."
"We're letting terrorists in."
"We're losing our identity."
And it is true that there are also people who are very much in favor or empathize with people fleeing war, but I can also see that among those people there is a kind of shielding themselves from the mistakes of politicians not to act, so as not to participate in initiatives that can, if not solve, at least alleviate these serious personal dramas.
In the informal discourse and in the official discourse, the learning of German stands out as something key for the integration of refugees.
I am from Barcelona, I am a linguist.
For four years I have lived in Cologne, in Germany, and for me language learning is also a key factor to be able to integrate, but not only for refugees is a key factor, but for all immigrants in general.
I research different aspects of the language in multilingual environments for several years, and for me the language is not an end product that can be mastered.
For me the language is a process that is changing throughout life, throughout the personal experiences that we are having.
Obviously, language is a powerful instrument of integration, of inclusion, but also a powerful instrument of social exclusion.
If, for example, you have poor linguistic competence or have a foreign accent, or a certain dialect of a region, or, perhaps, you have some type of disability that affects you to the production of the oral language, such as, for example, stuttering, all these are examples that influence how people will accept you or marginalize you in a society.
The use of language and identity is not something static, it is something that is changing.
It's not like fingerprints, which is what accompanies you all your life.
Identity is something that is created or forged according to the values and beliefs that your family gives you, your friends give you and also goes according to what you really want to be, and what you really want to be is based on your motivation, the feeling of belonging that you have with other groups with which you feel like or identified and also depending on the interactions with groups that are totally different from you.
Free German classes are offered in Germany, and one might think, it is natural to think, that these people should be happy to be able to receive these German courses and also that they should be grateful.
But the absence of teenage girls in these German groups, in these activities, is really significant.
Get in situation: these girls carry a lot of burden, many post-traumatic disorders, due to an exodus, a land that no one had promised them, they have seen how they murdered their loved ones, they have seen how they burned or bombed their homes, others unfortunately have also witnessed or victims of rape in their particular transfer from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria on the way to Europe, or on the way in this case of Germany.
If you put yourself in your skin, would you feel like doing German or anything else?
For more inri, the families of these girls, the parents, the siblings or other relatives, prevent them from participating in these activities because they think that, perhaps, they will harm them even more.
And the question is: What to do to get these girls to start participating in this new society and that they can integrate?
This is the question we asked four friends: with the red sweater, Sandra, then there is me, Lina and Peter.
The four, for different reasons, have a lot to do with adolescence.
Peter and I, for having quinceañera daughters.
And Sandra and Lina, for also working with this group, adolescence.
We think: what if we do a project where it is not only attractive to refugee girls, but also attractive to German girls?
Could we get them together?
Could we create a space for them to interact and perhaps with it that could contribute to transform their identity?
Thus was born the inicative of HalloPhoto!.
It is an intercultural project for teenage girls between 13 and 17 years old.
The objectives of this project were: to develop... well, first create these spaces of interaction to be able to develop communication skills.
And the creative skills of the girls.
We thought: if we developed both things, we are sure to create the possibility that they will also develop intercultural competences.
Obviously, to develop communication skills, we had to go through the learning of German, there was no other, and we used a novel method: augmentative communication boards.
Augmentative communication boards are aids for people who are not verbal, i.e. people who do not have oral language.
This condition can occur from birth, for example in the case of children with severe autism spectrum disorders, or for example in children with cerebral palsy.
Also this condition can occur when you are already an adult, because you have a stroke or because you have an accident, or because you suffer a neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson’s.
These boards that we use for the project are composed of pictograms and core vocabulary.
The core vocabulary is the words that are repeated most in the spontaneous language and this happens, not only in German, but also in Spanish, in Catalan, in Basque, in English, etc.
The truth is that the girls accepted these instruments very well, and the data collected in the project show that they do, that they value it positively.
Anyway, for them this is not the determining thing to learn German, to have dreams, to be motivated, to really want to participate in this new society.
For them, the really significant, are the meetings that we form, that we organize in HalloFoto!, in our project.
They are intercultural encounters because we were encouraging face-to-face interaction of groups with totally different frames of reference.
This, for example, is the image of one of the encounters.
We organized these intercultural meetings by topic and the topics were decided by them.
This is the theme "Makeup and hairdresser".
In another of the encounters we went to an adventure center where there were zip lines, there were balance games, tunnels.
The issue was not to create fear, but to overcome fear.
Together they were helping each other, and it was not a matter of who was most afraid or less afraid, which group was the one who was most afraid or less, was simply each one in its expression.
They already see it in the faces, they can not define who is who, the one who is afraid.
The fact is that in this, along with other encounters... “This is the meeting we did about cooking.” They see meaning.
And it is in that construction of meaning that generates a sense of miscegenation, a sense of creating bonds, intercultural developments that go beyond labels.
The labels all they do is generate stereotypes and generate prejudices that do not account for the great wealth that we are each of us, or that we have each of us.
In addition to the communication skills we also wanted to develop creative competencies.
Creativity is the affective and cognitive expression of each individual.
And if we activate that expression together, first, a space is developed to generate things, first unthinkable, that are miscegenations of expressions where you can already begin to see how an intercultural competence is being forged.
For that these photography workshops were done, to generate this creativity.
The photography workshops were made by Peter and Sandra, who are the group’s photographers.
And these are the photos that the girls took throughout the project.
Sometimes they posed and sometimes they were photographers, they decided.
And when one sees these pictures, she thinks: where is the "she"?
Where is the "we"?
Borders are very diluted.
How do we define ourselves?
The photos seemed so precious to us that we thought we should make an exhibition.
But we didn’t want to make an exhibition at use, we didn’t want to make an exhibition in a museum or art gallery.
We wanted to move our photos, our exhibition, to an urban space and we had a vision.
This is the computer recreation of our vision: we wanted our girls to be on a tram, the tram of desire.
Our desire was to have a platform, a platform that was a political statement against sexism and against xenophobia.
We presented it to the public transports of Cologne and they were quite excited about the project.
And in early July, last July, the tram was presented with the photos of the girls.
(Applause) The project was much more successful than we imagined.
In fact, the press highlighted us as an exemplary project, to counteract the xenophobic trends that are sadly more and more, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe.
Also, there were many people who asked us if they could replicate the project, if they could make their special HalloPhoto!.
And for this reason we think: we are going to license it, so that everyone can use it.
That is why the project is in Creative Commons, and from this scenario, from TEDxValladolid, I invite everyone who wants to participate and launch their own project, to do it.
(Applause) And it's not what we've taught, the four people on the team, but what the girls have taught us.
All the participants in the group have shown us ways to communicate and ways of interacting.
First, they break stereotypes.
Second, they create bridges.
That have also generated transformed, powerful and intercultural identities, and these intercultural identities are not based on consensus, but on mutual respect, in that mutual respect to empathize with the other, to put themselves in the shoes of the other, in order to have that feeling of belonging.
And that feeling of belonging is the one I've been feeling before you while I was telling you all this, and for this I'm so grateful.
(Applause)
What comes to mind when you hear the words post-traumatic stress disorder?
Maybe words like war, violence or army.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing life-threatening events, such as war, accidents, aggressions, or natural disasters.
Symptoms can include: nightmares, reviscences, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, avoiding things and places, and negative thoughts. What comes to mind when I ask you, what is mental health?
Maybe you're thinking about: Depressed... me?
I don't have that!
Hospital, or how does our mind work?
During the summer of 2016, I traveled alone to Amsterdam, before studying in Salamanca, Spain.
I visited Anne Frank's house.
As he walked down the halls and floors, he looked at the pictures and the stories.
At a certain point I just stood there... and cried.
I was moved by what I saw and read.
No one thought this was strange, nor did he speak to me when he saw me cry.
In this space, I felt like I could do it, and I stayed there as long as I could.
No one knew that my reason for entering this place was to find a place to cry, where no one asked me why.
No one knew, at the time, that I was crying because I had been sexually assaulted.
This feeling of fear, shame, led me to remain silent, to find comfort in a place where crying seemed to be fine.
I came home wanting to erase this memory forever, but everything changed quickly.
I began to experience panic attacks, often originating pictures places and news, which reminded me of the assault.
I felt guilty and ashamed, I felt empty and alone.
And even though I saw myself as someone who had everything under control, deep within me, I was crumbling.
Don't tell, they're gonna think you're crazy!
Why did you walk alone?
Why did you travel alone?
But why did you get into this situation?
How are you today?
This.
This helped me decide to seek help.
When I started having suicidal thoughts, my best friend told me, that I had help available, and she connected me to the health and psychological services in college.
When I had panic attacks, I had friends who were just a message or call away.
They had nothing to say, they just listened.
Support, acceptance, and having someone close by, allowed me to seek that help.
Over time, I received the help I needed and was able to recover from post-traumatic stress disorder.
According to the World Health Organization, about 800 000 people die by suicide each year.
In 2016 there were 3569 suicides in Spain, according to the National Institute of Statistics.
Nearly ten people a day, one every two and a half hours.
Suicide can be prevented and although we are not all experts, psychologists or psychiatrists, we all have the power to make a difference in someone’s life, and we play a critical role in creating change.
It can be as simple as listening.
Yes, it is important to risk talking loudly for those who have lived or are living the trauma.
But if my friend hadn't risked asking me how she was, maybe I, I would never have talked.
I challenge you to break the barrier between those who are struggling and those who are not, because no one has to feel ashamed of not being well.
Each of us has to take a risk and reach out, and ask, how are you today?
Thanks.
(Applause)
How nice to be here.
(Applause) (End of applause) I've always wondered where the pace is.
Will it be in the ear?
Will it be in what I hear?
Or is he in what I see?
And then, talking on the phone with me, I realize... How?
That in what I see.
Around me there are so many rhythms.
And if I were deaf, couldn't I move?
Of course, Mary!
Because the rhythm is outside in what you see.
And it's inside your body.
I'm falling out of something.
Yeah, the pants.
They've put so many wires in me to talk to you.
(Laughter) But they forgot that I have pants.
(Applause) Yeah, I got them.
I want to tell you that there's nothing like a smile.
When someone approaches and says, "I want to dance."
Of course.
You can dance now.
With what?
With what you have.
Oh!
I see a mirror in my hand.
Oh!
The mirror tells me that yes... you can.
What is time?
Time is in doing and giving.
It's no good what I have inside, if I don't have a chance to give to the other.
So that in turn you find paths and movement.
Maria, what about the rhythm?
It's inside you.
When you breathe; (Exhalation) you already have rhythm inside.
When you see, the rhythm is outside.
I'm full of little lights of colors that speak to me, they're stars.
Stars that illuminate, illuminate this afternoon.
No, Mary, it's the day.
No, it looks like night.
Because the stars light when it's night.
What is the day?
Having stars in the hands that look at us and talk to us.
Can you give this?
Of course I do!
Because it's inside you.
It's inside every look.
In every move we make is the rhythm you have created.
The rhythm is out of your body, but how beautiful what I have on the ground.
It's a circle.
What a wonder.
It has no doors.
The circle has no doors.
I don't know where to go.
But how am I up here?
They brought me.
You have brought me here to come near you.
And tell them that it can.
Don't be afraid.
If I can't do this, I can do another.
If I can't do another, I can do the other one.
I'm the other one.
I'm here to give you what you don't say you have.
What do you have?
Life.
What is life?
That's what I don't know.
That's what I want to find.
That's what I want to look for.
And only the movement will help me.
That's why I ask you, if the word is movement and in my body there is a rhythm that I don't hear, you know?
I'm deaf.
I don't know what the sound of the word is.
But I know, deaf as I am, I can feel the infinite rhythm that moves my body.
And I like dancing, you know?
I've always wanted to dance.
Because I always see the movement.
The movement, you know when it starts?
When I open my eyes in the morning and say, "How beautiful the day you are waiting for me!"
Today is my day.
Thanks.
(Applause)
She just got a letter document.
He assumes that they ask him to pay or go and think about the boys, think about his work, think about the couple who abandoned her; he opens it and reads it.
He doesn't understand, he can't understand.
They're asking him to leave now, to leave now, the kids are gone, things scattered.
I would have nowhere to go to sleep today.
If I had a translator on my phone, without losing any information, I could read this.
[Pay in 48 hours, if you won't be sued.]
And she would stay calm, and maybe she would go to the Access to Justice Center where she would be told that she has time and that they will help her.
But there is no translator of the lawyer language into a language that we all understand.
Google says it’s too expensive for the few that we’re the community we’re making right to.
The letter is not understood but sends two messages.
The first is "I put a lawyer."
The conflict went up and now we can't solve it by talking.
The second one is darker.
The second one says, "You.
It is outside the language of the law."
The language belongs to lawyers and lawyers, judges and judges, but not you.
As she is going to have to fix herself in some way, we all know that many times in Argentina, "some form" is outside the law.
So that does not happen, I am part of the Argentine Network of Claro Language, where we try to bring the language of the law closer to the language of every day.
After all, the law in democracy is ours.
(Applause)
Today, in this place, we are approximately 5000 women.
1250 of us suffered or will suffer a sexual assault at some point in his life.
1 in 4.
Only 10% will make the complaint.
The remaining 90% take refuge in silence.
One half, because the fact happens within the family or with someone known and that makes it much harder to live and count.
The other half does not speak because they fear they will not believe them.
And they're right, because we don't believe them.
Today I want to tell you why I think we don't believe you.
We do not believe them because when a woman tells what happened to her, she says things that we do not imagine, that disturb us, that we do not expect to hear, that awe.
We hope to hear stories like this.
"Young man raped on the tracks of the Mitre Railway.
It happened at midnight when he was returning home.
The young woman said that a subject assaulted her in the back, told her not to scream, that she had a gun, that she would stay still.
He raped her and then ran away."
When we hear or read such a story, we are immediately represented by an image: the rapist, a lower class depravity; the victim, a young, attractive woman.
The image does not last more than 10 or 20 seconds and is dark, it is flat; there are no movements, no sounds, it is as if there are no people.
But when a woman tells what happened to her, her story doesn’t fit in 10 or 20 seconds.
The next is the testimony of a woman we are going to call Ana.
One of the 85 women I interviewed during the course of an investigation I did into rape.
Says Ana: "We had gone with the girls in the office to the same pub that we always go.
We met some pibes and I got hooked with a skinny hair.
We talked a lot.
At about 4 o'clock I told my friends to leave; they wanted to stay.
Then the skinny one asked me where he lived and told me that if it seemed right to me, he would approach me.
I accepted and left.
At a traffic light he told me that he liked me and touched my leg.
I don't like a guy moving forward like that, but he'd been loving all night.
I thought, "I can't be so paranoid, I'm saying something to him and the guy nothing to see and offend him."
When he had to bend, he kept going long.
I thought I was wrong and I said, 'You passed!
', but something ugly I felt.
Now I think, why don't I pay attention to what I felt?
When the car stopped near the highway, there I was afraid.
But he told me to stay calm, that I liked him, that nothing would happen if I didn’t want to; he spoke well.
I didn't say anything to him because I was afraid he'd get angry and everything was worse.
I thought I could have a gun in the glove compartment.
Suddenly he threw himself at me and wanted to kiss me.
I said, 'No!
'; I wanted to push it, but my arms were in.
When I let go I tried to open the door, but I was locked.
Anyway, if I got out of the car, where did I go?
I told him that he wasn’t the kind of guy who needs to do that to be with a mine; that I liked him too, but not that way.
I was trying to calm him down, he said nice things about him.
He talked to her like I was his older sister.
Suddenly, he covered my mouth with one hand and with the other he unbuckled his belt.
At that point I thought I could kill myself, hang myself, you know?
I never felt so alone, like I was kidnapped.
I asked him to finish fast and take me home."
What happened to you listening to this story?
Surely, several questions appeared to them.
For example, why didn't you turn down the window and ask for help?
Why didn't you get out of the car when you felt something ugly could happen?
How could you ask her to take her home?
Now, when we are not facing news in the media, in the face of a story that someone like me tells them from a stage like this; when we are in front of someone we know and who chose us to entrust their story to us, what happened to them, we will have to listen to it.
And we're going to hear things that we won't be able to understand or accept.
Then we will be heard doubts, questions, suspicions, and that will make us feel very bad; guilty.
So to defend ourselves from that discomfort, we have a resource.
We turned the volume up to all those things in history that we expected to hear: the revolver in the glove compartment, the doors locked, the isolation of the place.
And we lowered the volume to all those things that we did not expect to hear and that we do not want to hear: as for example when she tells him that he also liked him, or when he tells us that he spoke to him as if he were the older sister, or that he asked her to take her to the house.
What's the point in doing this?
To believe her, so I can trust that she was really a victim.
I call this victimization of the victims.
Victimization because in order to believe that he is innocent and that he is a victim, we need to think of them unarmed, paralyzed, mute.
But there is another way to get rid of the discomfort, and that is exactly the reverse: we raised the volume to the things we did not expect to hear, such as: "I spoke well to you", "I asked you to take me to my house", "I asked you to finish it quickly", and we lower it to the things that we did expect to hear, the revolver in the glove compartment, the isolation.
This what's it for?
It serves so that we can hold on to doubts, and feel more comfortable with doubts.
So new questions appear, for example: Who sends her to go to those bowling alleys?
Did you see how she and the friends, the minis, the necklines dress?
What do you expect?
Questions that, are certainly not questions, are rather judgments and judgments that end in a sentence: She sought it out.
The sentence would be corroborated by the fact that she later does not say she fought to avoid rape.
So it means he didn't resist, it means he consented.
If you looked for her and consented, what rape do you talk about?
I call this guilt of the victims.
Both the arguments that serve us to blame and to victimize, we all have in our heads, very handy, including victims and victimizers.
So much so that when Anne came to me, she told me that she did not know if her testimony would serve me, because I was not sure that what had happened to her would have been a violation.
Ana, like most of us, also believed that a rape is more like an armed robbery, a violent procedure that lasts 4 or 5 minutes, and not the chamuyo of a pleasant young man who lasts a whole night and who ends in a kidnapping.
When she was afraid of being killed, she was afraid of being left with marks, and had to surrender her body to avoid it, there she knew that rape was something else.
Ana had never talked about this with anyone.
He could have turned to the family, but he didn't.
He didn't do it because he was afraid.
He was afraid that the person she had chosen to tell him, the same thing happened to all of us, and that is that doubts and suspicions arise, those questions, every time a topic like this is talked about.
And if that had happened, it would have been maybe, worse than the rape itself.
He could have spoken to a friend, with a sister, very hard with the couple: the slightest hint of doubt on her face or voice would have been devastating to her, and probably the end of the relationship.
Ana remains silent because she intimately knows that no one, not all of us, not even her family, not the therapists, let alone the police or the magistrates, are willing to listen to what Ana did at the time.
First and foremost, Ana said "no."
When he saw that his was not useless, he spoke well, he tried not to exacerbate his violence, not to give him ideas.
He spoke to him as if everything that was happening at that time was normal, so as not to awaken in him the fear that she could later report it.
Now, I wonder and ask them: isn’t all that she did is resist?
No, it's not for everyone or almost all of us, probably, because it's not for the law.
In most countries, the codes continue to ask that the victim, to prove her innocence, I say well, the victim to prove her innocence, present marks on the body that testify that she held a "tenacious and constant" struggle with her aggressor.
I can assure you that in most court cases, there are no marks they reach.
I heard a lot of women.
And I did not hear any of them speak of themselves as having been reduced to one thing, totally subject to the will of the other.
Rather, I heard them as amazed and even a little proud to recognize how lucid they had been at the time, attentive to every detail, as if that allowed them to have some control over what was going on.
So I thought, "Sure, what women do in these situations is negotiate."
They negotiate sex for life.
They ask the assailant to finish fast, so that everything ends as soon as possible and with the lowest cost.
They undergo penetration, because even if they can’t believe it, penetration is what keeps them from a sexual or affective scene.
They undergo penetration, because penetration hurts less than kisses, caresses, soft words.
Now, if we are going to continue waiting for the rapes to be what they are very rarely: a rapist who is a low-class depravity, and not a young university student or an entrepreneur who leave the wake up on a Friday or a Saturday; if we are going to continue waiting for the victims to be modest, demured women, who faint on the scene, and not confident women of themselves, we will continue without being able to listen.
Women will still not be able to speak, and we will all remain responsible for that silence and their solitude.
(Applause)
You can imagine: you are in a bar and, you know, or in a nightclub, all that, and you start talking to a girl, and after a while, well, it comes out in the conversation "what do you work on?"
And since you think your work is interesting, you say, "I'm a mathematician."
(Laughter) 33.51% of girls (Laughter) at the time simulate an urgent phone call and leave.
(Laughter) 64.69% of girls desperately try to change the subject and leave.
(Laughter) There are 0.8% who are your cousin, your girlfriend and your mother, (Laughter) who know you work on something weird but didn’t remember what (Laughter) and there’s 1% that follows the conversation.
When that conversation goes on, invariably at some point one of these 2 sentences appears: A) "I was fatal with mathematics, but it was not my fault, it is that the teacher was horrific."
(Laughter) And B) "But that math for what's it?"
(Laughter) I'll take care of case B.
(Laughter) When someone asks you what math is for, they’re not asking you about applications from the math science.
He's asking you, "Why did I have to study that shit I never used again?"
(Laughter) That's what he's really asking you.
Faced with this, when a mathematician is asked what mathematics is for, we mathematicians divide into groups.
54.51% of mathematicians take a stance on the attack, and 44.77% of mathematicians take a defensive stance.
There is 0.8%, rare, among those that I include myself.
What are the attack?
Those of the attack are mathematicians who tell you that this question is not meaningful, because mathematics has a sense of its own in themselves, they are a beautiful building that has a logic of its own that is built and that you do not need to be always looking at possible applications.
What is poetry for?
What is love for?
What is life itself for?
What question is that?
(Laughter) Hardy, for example, is an exponent of this attack.
And those on the defensive tell you that even if you don't realize it, honey, math is behind everything.
(Laughter) These always name bridges and computers.
If you don't know math, you drop the bridge.
(Laughter) Really computers are all math.
Now he has also given them to tell you that behind computer security and credit cards are prime numbers.
These are the answers that your math teacher will give you if you ask him.
It's from the defensive.
Okay, but who's right?
Do those who say that mathematics doesn’t have to do anything, or those who say it’s really behind it all?
You're really right both.
But I told you I was that 0.8% weird that says something else, right?
So, okay, ask me what mathematics is for.
(The public asks) Okay!
76.34% of people have asked, there are 23.41% who have been silent, and 0.8% that I do not know what those are doing.
Well, dear 76.31%, mathematics is true that they do not have to do anything, it is true that they are a beautiful building, a logical building, probably one of the greatest collective efforts that the human being has made throughout history.
But it is also true that wherever scientists, where technicians, are looking for mathematical theories, models that allow them to advance, there they are, in the building of mathematics, that permeate everything.
It is true that we have to go something more in the background, let’s see what is behind science.
Science works by intuition, by creativity, and mathematics tame intuition and tame creativity.
Almost everyone who hasn’t heard it before is surprised that if you took a 0.1 mm thick sheet of paper, those we normally used, large enough, and could fold it 50 times, the thickness of that heap would occupy the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
Your intuition tells you, "That's impossible."
Check the math and you'll see that it is.
That's what mathematics is for.
It is true that science, all science, only makes sense because it makes us better understand the beautiful world in which we are.
And because it makes us, it helps us to get around the traps of the world this painful one we are in.
There are sciences that touch that application with the hand.
Oncological science, for example.
And there are others that we look at her from afar, with envy sometimes, but knowing that we are her support.
All basic sciences are the support of those, and among them mathematics.
All that makes science science is the rigor of mathematics.
And that rigor comes because their results are eternal.
They have probably said, or have ever been told, that a diamond is forever, right?
It depends on what you understand forever!
A theorem, that is forever!
(Laughter) The Pythagorean theorem, that's true even if Pythagoras is dead, I'm telling you.
(Laughter) Even if the world sinks the Pythagorean theorem would still be true.
Where a pair of cathets and a good hypotenuse (Laughter) meet the Pythagorean theorem works full, butt.
(Applause) Well, mathematicians are dedicated to doing theorems.
Eternal truths.
But it is not always so easy to know what is an eternal truth, a theorem, and what is a mere conjecture.
A demonstration is needed.
For example: imagine that I have here a large, huge, infinite field.
I want to cover it with equal pieces, leaving no gaps.
I could use squares, right?
I could use triangles.
Circles no, leaving eggs.
What is the best piece I can use?
The one that to cover the same surface has a smaller edge.
Pappus of Alexandria, in the year 300 said that it was best to use hexagons, as bees do.
But he didn't prove it!
The guy said "hexagons, uh, peta, come on, hexagons, give it to me!"
He didn't prove it, he stayed in a conjecture, he said "Hexagons!"
The world, as you know, was divided between Papists and anti-pappists, until 1700 years later, 1700 years later, in 1999 Thomas Hales showed that Pappus and the bees were right, that it is best to use hexagons.
And that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem, which is going to be true forever, always, more than any diamond you have.
(Laughter) But what if we go to 3 dimensions?
If I want to fill the space, with equal pieces, leaving no gaps, I can use cubes, right?
No, spheres, leaving eggs.
(Laughter) What's the best piece I can use?
Lord Kelvin, the one with the Kelvin grades and all that, that said it was best to use a truncated octahedron (Laughter) that you all know (Laughter) is this here!
(Applause) Come On!
Who doesn’t have a truncated octahedron at home?
(Laughter) Even plastic.
Baby, bring the truncated octahedron, which come visits.
Everybody has!
(Laughter) But Kelvin didn't prove it.
He stayed in a conjecture, Kelvin's conjecture.
The world as you know, split between Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists (Laughter) until one hundred and peak years later, one hundred and outdog years later, someone found a better structure.
Weaire and Phelan, Weaire and Phelan found this little thing here, (Laughter) this structure to which they put the imaginative structure name of Weaire and Phelan.
(Laughter) It seems like a weird thing but it's not so rare, it's also present in nature.
It is very curious that this structure, for its geometric properties, was used to build the swimming building at the Beijing Olympics.
Alla Michael Phelps won 8 gold medals, became the greatest swimmer of all time.
Well, all the time until another one gets better, right?
How it happens to the structure of Weaire and Phelan, it is the best until another one comes out.
But be careful, because this one does have the opportunity, that even if they spend a hundred and peak years, even if it is in 1700 years, someone shows that this is the best piece possible.
And then it will be a theorem, a truth forever, ever.
More than any diamond.
So, well, if you want to tell someone that you love him forever (Laughter) you can give him a diamond, but if you want to say that you want him forever, always, give him a theorem!
(Laughter) That yes, still, you will have to prove it, that your love does not remain in conjecture.
(Applause) Thank you.
We are each one in a way in this life.
Some are more outgoing, others more introverted and others, neither one thing nor the other.
I, I have to say, I'm very introverted.
I'm not good at social relationships.
Imagine how difficult it is for me to put myself in this red dot in front of so many people.
It is much more interesting for me to stay on a quiet Saturday with a friend or two, than to get into the hustle and bustle of a nightclub full of people.
And I tell you no more, to stay at home, calm, to the heat, watching a movie.
Oh, the movies!
There's nothing in this world that I like better.
Film has been my biggest passion in the last 5 or 6 years.
In this time, I have developed a taste for cinema that goes beyond the meaning of the word "entertainment".
Why the cinema?
What does cinema have to make me like so much?
If I tell you the truth, until recently I had not asked myself that question.
I’ve already said that I’m not good at interacting with people, but I’m very good at watching.
I love to watch.
I really enjoy watching people talk, interact with each other, walk, without being a gossipe.
Don't think wrong.
But that's why I think I like cinema so much.
In the movies, in the movies, you don’t come in, you just deign to watch them from the outside.
Cinema gives you a broad, total vision of the world, of all its people, of all its ideas, of all its ways of seeing reality.
And I think that's why I like cinema so much.
In all this time, I’ve seen thousands of those visions and I think I have a much more global idea in the world than if I had never watched, or watched movies.
I think that’s the great advantage of being behind, of not interacting.
And what kind of cinema do I like?
I admit, not that it is the most typical cinema of people my age.
It is an author’s cinema, independent cinema, low budget, social denunciation, far from the archetypes of U.S. cinema, cinema of countries as rare cinematically as Turkey, Palestine or the Philippines.
Well, my mother says I'm very weird, but it's the kind of movie I like the most, which I enjoy the most, with its characters and stories.
They get to your heart.
You feel things with them, you suffer with them, you cry with them, you laugh with them.
As one of my favorite directors, Lars von Trier, says, “Movies are like stones in shoes, they have to hurt.”
It’s not that we have to suffer with each and every movie, but we have to feel true emotions.
However, when I watch U.S. movies, full of special effects, empty characters, stories that bring nothing, it’s just a story, nothing more.
It doesn't come to you, you don't feel, you don't suffer, you don't cry.
That, for me, is useless.
I, being an introvert, carried my hobby to the cinema as something of mine, something personal.
Everyone knew that he was very moviegoing but he had practically no one to comment on the movies he watched.
All this changed a day in which, ironically, I leave the cinema and receive a private message from Twitter: "Hi, we are looking for a boy or girl in Valladolid who covers us this edition of the Seminci.
Would you sign up?"
And what would I say 7 days after the best author cinema in Europe and on top of it for free?
Well, "Of course.
Count on me."
And here you had me, at the age of 15 and a journalist accreditation hanging around my neck.
That week I watched movies, movies and movies.
I got into the journalistic world a little, but what I got out of there was so much more than that.
I finally found a way to channel my feelings into the cinema, to express myself, to open my inner world to others.
Every day I had to write a chronicle with the movies I watched, what I liked about them, what I had disliked.
And I don’t know if it may seem easy or difficult, but it’s very complicated, because a movie has many elements: the script, the direction, the actors, the music, the sound.
And what's okay with each of them?
Do you make the movie good or bad?
At first, this was very complicated.
I always forgot things in the chronicle.
But in the end, with practice, I almost got fluid.
When the 58th edition of the Seminci ended, I began to collaborate on a regular basis with the web that had accredited me, which is called Essencia Cine.
In this time, almost a year, my ability to write, to express myself, and my enormous fondness for cinema have been increasing and increasing by leaps and bounds.
That was last year.
What happened this year?
That I hung the accreditation again and got back on the job at the 59th edition of the Seminci.
I assure you that this year I learned much more because I saw more movies, practically 20 in 7 days, I went to many more press conferences and I had a meeting with Imanol Arias.
The result was a week of cinema, cinema and more cinema, in which I learned a lot.
And I assure you that that will always be, even if I did not study, even if I did not eat practically even if I did not sleep, I learned and it will stay for me forever.
A lot of people, when I tell them I write for a website, which I write for the Seminci, almost everyone says to me, "Do you get paid?"
Well...
Well, no.
Why would I get paid?
Why are you going to pay me when I do what I really like, what I really feel and it's for me to open up to others?
At this age I'm, I wouldn't find anyone to pay me for doing this.
I don't have the race, I have nothing.
But, really, in this life, if you want to do something, do it.
If you get paid, great.
If not, you will be happy with your work, which I think is the most important thing.
No?
(Applause) Cinema has opened many more doors than I thought.
Because I write about cinema, I get to open up, I really get to be me.
When I write, I break the barrier I have of oral expression, which costs me so much.
I can really be me, to capture my ideas as I feel them.
But far from all this, which serves me a lot and what I am proud of, I think that what I like the most, with what I enjoy most with my work, is when I write something, a news, criticism or reportage, I hang it and receive messages from colleagues, friends, family, teachers who say: "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love it."
You know that when you do that, your job, apart from coming well with you, is good for others because they enjoy and learn with what you do.
And when they tell you that, you know it's great.
(Applause) And here you see me, a quiet, shy, introverted boy, who at 15 years old and without any faith in himself, managed to do the same work as some journalists with his work, his degree, his salary and his best skills of expression in public.
The way I found to open up wouldn't change it for anything.
I am when I write, it is me.
And I'm going to tell you something, don't trust what you see of me every day, what you see in photos and videos.
You don't trust.
Trust what I write, because that's me, really me.
No cover, no barrier.
But, far from all this, that "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love what you do," is the best thing they can tell me.
It's the most beautiful thing you can tell me in life, being an introvert.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
