What is counted? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor pastry
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will apparently have to overcome obvious language barriers if the members of the Prague Board and the City Council are to understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked Slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition governed Prague.
The codified dictionary that used Prague's political cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the metropolis' best-known characters, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," Culture Councillor Lukáš Kaucký said during the "colleague" terminology exam.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may know the concept of "golf hole".
"It's possibly the only expression of all the ones you asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague golf's biggest hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "treason of the capital" and "shield".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will eventually be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
"I don't get into these things or do I intend to value how much fun civic democrats have."
"What does matter to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," he said.
As we have seen, councillor Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have noticed that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he got right in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I rather know it from the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; In addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; Plachý is soon revealed that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the Social Democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my teammates, but it really seems like we don't have anything like it."
"Rather, among ourselves we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or play on the names," says Prague ČSSD chairman Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
To his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), Representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the elections cheating during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his peers.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of truncheon rights" apparently recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, single and have no children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such a fate."
"Nor are healthy young women isolated, because they help with the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso cares for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities in a special residence.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a drawback.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso's neighbour Ghana, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with petrol and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman caught on to the oil used for ritual anointings.
It went up in flames when the group wanted to "drive out evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to quell the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated.
"Gambian President Jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen from Gambian villages to the president's property in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released around a thousand detainees.
Bakala's tenant: heated with charcoal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly and tough man walked through the doors of the RPG Byty customer service center of "coal tycoon" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new rental contracts of three floors: his, his daughter and his son, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just been caught by the liberalization of rents.
Instead of CZK 3,500 a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in the new contract of his son, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half-angry, half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes a gesture.
"Everyone says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing ground for liberalisation.
After the New Year it will happen with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
RPG's mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up a number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a light button on its touch screen.
When pressed, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the living room is not here because of the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the past: settlement requests, insurance issues, and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's just starting," reply, after briefly hesitating, the workers who are in it when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old flats for miners of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already discussed loud and clear by the deputy speaker of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom plate," vents the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, at the moment retirees come mostly to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
Half of the discount on February's rent will also be received by the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rent in 2011," estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on rent, the matter must be resolved by an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely lawful course of action," RPG warns in its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don't have the means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, increasing it is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not cover even the amounts needed to maintain the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with rents, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5,200 million.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stands out in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," the screen states.
Only increased by 38% the rental of 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of SEK 19.66 per square metre," says RPG.
In 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not hit rents all at once, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) again in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rent increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
Nobody would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything typical of such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to come to it.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known buildings in Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-nursery.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and draftsmen to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, childcare is one of the benefits it offers Arch.Design to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Construction and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-nursery was the brainchild of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to secure funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-crèche is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an endowment of more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the Arch.Design company is obliged to keep the mini-nursery running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the presentation of the financing application.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; In addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently accommodates children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-nursery", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-nursery programme are comparable to the programme of regular pre-school education.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school readiness, they teach even English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprisingly, this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firm companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. See Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order is observed.
At night, the entire façade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way as to improve the brightness of the colors.
It meanders and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of carrying out a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his project plans emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the property owner and the mosaics used on the façade.
On the façade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration on Casa Batlló's proposals was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Park Güell, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic shape, locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Its tilt of forty-five degrees may seem strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the building regulations of the moment and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the indicated data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
He was annoyed, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, quite the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself settled.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most ornate apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, reaching 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and box spring: women and men look for different things
No pompous frame for the bed; What really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
First of all, they must complement each other perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not properly aerated and are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Mold may even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system problems, so they receive poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred memory foam mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on; During the night, he will not spin like after a tough match.
Simply, you sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been dealing with the problems of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics, a subject she teaches in specialized schools, for many years.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the box springs at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When touching it with your hand or when you settle on the mattress, you certainly shouldn't notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, do not make sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe poorly and you can not wash their cover, which is often done today.
And, given that every night we perspire between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
That's why sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care carefully about cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured around its perimeter, so when opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for the beds designed to spend one night visits.
However, it should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet bed frames containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better to have a box spring with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Articulating sheet bed frames should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "circle" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very broad shoulders, this is very important.
Even mattress manufacturers remember them who, in the "masculine", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are bed bases with cross structure or slats with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and "fluffy"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcement box spring or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Likewise, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool off" with breeze plant extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
The favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold and viscoelastic foam allow to manufacture mattresses of different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you from seven thousand crowns up.
Those that perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, sometimes offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is available free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Consequently, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Memory foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to learn about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell each other that this is not about spying, but about another means to reduce the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to wear it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even the youngest children are very creative about intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobiles, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In its view, it is questionable whether, in the event of an attack, such a device is actually useful.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will almost always check whether the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices spreads, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of advertising."
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
"You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If it is harmed, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"More expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
Such a service can even be obtained with smartphones with navigation, on which only special software needs to be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil's Pilin, that's why tests are currently underway with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or to identify him after a certain amount of time, which can buy the police time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the checking of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the entire Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to light explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the fusha for explosives from STV Group, a.s. for forty million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is nevertheless decided that, in such a case, all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year.
Neither Defense Minister Alexander Vondr nor army captain Vlastimil Picek wanted exempt.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of fuse.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they say that they have hardly any ammunition for various weapons, so even target practice is limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand that they repeatedly buy such quantities of wick from us."
"But it's their decision and they'll certainly know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer who, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick also saying that it will have stocks of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group points out that the fuse only has a service life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these trials are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, it got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defense's shopping center.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of fuse by police pyrotechnics, who eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for just enough ammunition to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life is over.
They decided on this for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in addition, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained in the meantime.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old wick will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought "cheap".
Until now I continue to live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
Last year, the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest was won by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story looks like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank, he bought a half-demolished house composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still in his junior year at university, he was really brave.
"Today, the value for money of accommodation in our area has prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first reconstructed floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back into the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said last year's number one entrepreneur.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels was greatly helped by winning the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," adds Pytloun gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still complimented me often and, I must say, I was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends everyone who wants to try a company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He states that, so far, he continues to live off contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"I've seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that got mainstream recognition."
"It's by no means my own personal success, it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It's only my name that appears on the front page," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet.
The euphoria over victory soon dissipated from the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the victor's hard work, Farmet may have already passed the worst.
Farmet company owner Karel Žďárský received first prize in the latest edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" contest last year at Prague's "Slavic House".
The jury appreciated his efforts, which led to the conversion of a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition," says last year's winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the state proposed to Karel Žďárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; He resigned from his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialist public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year perhaps it was not at Farmet just a taste of the euphoria of victory.
It also obtained recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, are not spared from such a situation either."
"Revenue was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must, at times, adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company's profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Regardless, where Farmet didn't cut back on spending was on research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the administration that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes," said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny for the fourth time and begins to create a fan base among the general public as well.
While last year's edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And this is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply in order to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers required for tax filing," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation improves especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for owning a company, the Czech Republic is in 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated in the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the www.firmaroku.cz website. The contest organizer then chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that receives the most votes wins.
For this year's survey, more than a hundred were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition were, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year's seventy proposals is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually hinders entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate each year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek announced.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not in the water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation of the employer to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a stand to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that came second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And to the third goes the loser.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their practice a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
New to this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special sub-category of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's main competition 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example disabled people, in others the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years now.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that's why it received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year contest finished third in the region.
In Olomouc the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the least possible impact on the environment," explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The head IT company Enlogit in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; In addition, it supports working from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in Distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Also in a good place with a mention is the laundry company Praní a čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that pass on to their pension funds.
"We provide benefits in food, transport, upskilling and leisure," says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically designated and answered the questions in the entry form and sent it to the organizers by August 15.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main contest" Vodafone Company of the Year."
"Individual entries for this contest are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year contest," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Plzeň
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that he attempted to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the land auctioned would be received by a precise interested party.
He was to pay Luboš G. half a million kronor for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen chief prosecutor general Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that she could not immediately release further details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way in which he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to apply for the invitation and, since he is also an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
For this favor, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was included in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was charged with dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land planned for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly on the site where a major road to the Borská pole industrial site is to be built.
Later, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
From January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Consequently, families will have to take out of their wallets, from January, several hundred kroner a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas becomes moderately more expensive, especially at a time when heating is used more and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about SEK 50 more per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than SEK 1,000 per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Pragueans will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase by up to 10% next year.
Young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under fifteen years of age to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get them drunk."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," Luděk Pelikán, head of paediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Právo.
"When they manage to grab their father from the cupboard, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it doesn't smell as much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use brandy that they picked at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when they brought her with 3.5 of alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department doctor about this case.
"I was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother was not surprised that her daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependence.
"Alcoholic is understood as a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at the Motol pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the mobile medical examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holidays."
"On Halloween I have seen up to seven drunk children in admissions at a time," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and it doesn't hurt at all."
"They're just confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they've generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job for you to earn enough to pay for that night," adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his view, perhaps as a regressive measure, which often reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so for children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seat version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the single-seat L-159.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took them over last week.
Jan Peješk of the defence press department says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, without additional investment or contribution from the Ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army is not running out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of SEK 200 million for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that retires the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for pilot practices in NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense directorate claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159s abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by holding a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer than ring rate are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men aged up to 60 years," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, it followed with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were just as likely to get prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; For men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but that he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, woke up on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and snowplows circulated all night in numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents involving commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two industrial vehicles collided causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 in the direction of Prague.
There two trucks collided.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and merge at kilometre 182 in Kyvalce.
Traffic jams of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
Traffic jams are forming, for example in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also concern the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three rapid.
The problems concern, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from eleven o'clock on Wednesday night until five o'clock in the morning.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vyškovska, snow tongues are forming in Brněnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them will require milling machines.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall gradually subsides in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is using a new "smart" weapon, known for the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" toward their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
To be sure, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws its murderous rain of metal chips, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise crosshairs and, based on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from its previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad neighborhood.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the sole tenant in Bad Homburg.
Managing director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of Frankfurt's economics section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with this he has gained a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city earlier about its intention.
"Naturally, we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the computer manufacturer's good contacts with the property owner on Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons produced the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to fill in the famous position.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial construction project for the spa town with the surplus buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they have installed the investment and appraisal council, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu is recognized as the world's third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name of TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking hold of Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure is possibly behind it following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
Wikileaks' platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known US senator, Joe Lieberman, calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, must remain in custody in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks banned from Amazon's server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with free speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon halted the use of its server through Wikileaks after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the Security of the Country had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous releases of classified information through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate prosecution of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls about an assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why there are fears for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to America's statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper claimed, clearly wryly, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counterterrorism Center, has been named an exceptional officer, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the major structural reforms" that are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream makers are prepared at the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream makers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Actually where does all the ice cream come from?
Of gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio takes the cream out of the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream makers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an enervating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste that is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national superior house and mainly in the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and instantly cools it up to four degrees.
Then turn on the machine faucet and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stableware?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to be distracted by the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to sneak flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must experience sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a base for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Whether it tastes better doesn't necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary that hazelnut ice cream tastes like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced blend highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is a problem of arithmetic: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, you have to lower the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make counting easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic elaboration of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
Brazil's Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled mini-first giant.
"In all courses," says maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This issue is currently being raised by the Testbiotech expert group, which considers itself an institute for independent biotechnology impact assessment.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to EFSA's testing standards for genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi's situation and mimic the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and with that she has changed her side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were made by the General Office for the Environment as well as a clairvoyant EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, including some from the industry, provided they are of a high and technical quality, they are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have any contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It bills itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the mandate of Lobby.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, accusingly, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
"The industry controls the safety investigation," Hilbeck says.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has obtained some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
It snowed.
The story is known: In September bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was debris.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He has secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he has smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
It has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dump," he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the North Wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the enemies of September 21 for several days.
And he explained that he could do absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing to do, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilo mazizo cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Ascend to his SUV, take a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the largest dealer in ancient stones in the country.
Braking.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Limestone alba, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
He points to a heap: Red Sandstone, an earlier piece from Karlsruhe station.
And it goes on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and cart, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer to do, in addition stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued there.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active influx in the buffet.
16 students crowd around muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of brainstorming contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And because universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try to glimpse exceptional talent in practical projects and attract them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over talent.
A lady from the personnel department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them his paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can get to know the students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point previously was technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI's prognostics, this engineering vacuum will grow even larger.
At the auditing and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern gymkhana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish universities' high potentials, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone fell short."
For the headhunter Dykta the grades give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs.
"We try to get students at the trade shows."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, personnel manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website there are 35 vacancies.
"It's been very difficult to fill the vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually can't offer it," says Stübe, the personnel manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child attendance or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For which he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the personnel manager, also expects extra points in her classification for her job seekers.
"I think the applicant pays special attention to the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
He advises his customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the template itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The government in Washington issued a strong ban and thereby annulled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also off the Atlantic coast remain new drilling prohibited for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil rig in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted to new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to lessen America's dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
Until today it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, different peterolero consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently the responsible control authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is being fundamentally reformed.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry is publicly announcing that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by advisory firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
The American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what exactly changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is brown oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spills have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water up to their chests with the brightness of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene seems almost pretty.
Brown oil stains are not seen floating on the surface.
I used to pick shrimp here by the handful, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland through a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the way of the river path that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the boat removes a brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palm trees hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier outside is silent, a kind of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, sullenly. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is a hard-fought battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke out more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to place its first factory in 1993,  Because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While pumping daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet,  The location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called to the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, so a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to the assessments of experts, more than two billion liters have been poured in 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the enduring environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaky pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are "over a greater multiple than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire is flamed: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of black Africa's largest oil states.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "those of the bunkers", who rigged the network of pipes that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the lion's share in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the weak way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come at any minute."
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely torn our country to pieces," Akpobari said.
Investigators detect dangerous manufacturing defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: The Australian aviation safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas' director, said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
Following the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian investigators announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, an ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become significant enough to inform everyone affected.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380s temporarily grounded.
Lufthansa replenished the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A snowfall across the country causes traffic chaos
All-white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost the entire country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Freezing temperatures were reached overnight Thursday across the country, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 off Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing new snow again and again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the rails or shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service treated the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany's largest airport, snow winds led to numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 tent beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of snowy streets: Here, too, a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after her car rolled over near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dust-like and therefore swirling in gentle gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly still be very cold, in some places up to negative 15 degrees.
Deusche Bank seeks buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently fixed its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the reinvention, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That's why Germany's largest lending institution is once again giving up its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from the investor of a fund of the house and then made the necessary arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper's towers renowned as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious at the scene of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted at the site of misfortune, but he did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team could get off for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently relatives and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They are silent for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal belongings, underneath clothing and surfboards.
Flags flew at half-mast outside the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants at the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
She can't come to terms with her son's death until she's seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
The first explosion on 19 November also buried miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's southern island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to explore the frontiers of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies' guts from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of approximately a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a pity that they cannot dismiss each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-stricken hairstyle "Pusher" to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more mainstream humor or a little less brutality from the art house.
A brain mass and guts sprouting cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and falls silent there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody façade, hides a piece of sometimes exciting cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for viewers.
Refn condede just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a lump in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that exits the river.
According to information from the CIA's international intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, an ordinary reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite imagery.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had only recently been in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than back then, the enigmas grew greater over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor on el-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead of us, a senior U.N. diplomat lapidary replied in the summer that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly paved the grounds.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium lurks in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a greater informative value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus said.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss it, in the same way as with satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed-out building.
Israel, too, is strictly silent.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation against the treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons is pending,  which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not so far made public what equipment they are, or what functions they have, or if they look suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits entry to all three IAEA sites.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a search that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to warnings from the US secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube along the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a senior official in Vienna said at least one of the equipment may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither uranium enrichment nor reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, lie in all three places.
As the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as a radioactive waste zone, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians carried out earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, wields the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, who is due to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires a majority of the IAEA's governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what happens if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She has written the screenplay herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, moving some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last minute.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, she told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's position on the matter gives the victims enough away about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted a permit to shoot in Sarajevo after a tug-of-war is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go regardless.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the net that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It's certain that Jolie's movie actually starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can currently achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers in Sweden, Finland and the U.S.
Fans scream with joy as loud music rumbles, banging on the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls into the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the withering question, what the future holds.
Fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I don't have a job there yet."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "in one fell swoop he got his dream job as an event manager, maybe that's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and Dublin's ESRI social research institute.
As of 2015, there were 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave comparable to the one suffered by the island in the eighties is coming.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the editor en masse from young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, leaves and loses our country and with it an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future as the government only works and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to get new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
He observes how his classmates go from one unrheumated practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive light.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On its website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like working in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they build a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay off a loan for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, since it is a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so well."
He laughs somewhat embarrassed and goes for icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"Those were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; If everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with that we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and simply see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just, not too many emotions," he says and takes a big drink of his beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is a greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it makes it possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, two related issues stand out.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a low 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they trusted their country's Congress and 45 per cent trusted its Government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has persisted during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only hit by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America are citing crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
Some 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The more positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, up from only 56 per cent in 2007 (see figure 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such titles in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Choices to the trash
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they fared much worse than foreigners trying to help the country recover from its troubles feared.
Votes were poured into the ballot box, some people voted multiple times, ballots dumped in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Nonetheless, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that it was "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on Dec. 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hope for the elections has yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the invalidation of the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has made it to the second round.
With the cholera epidemic raging in the country and more than a million earthquake survivors still living in tents, large abstentions are expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were unable to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
The stakes are high.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And, as has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Tiptoeing toward the center
In the weeks since losing her husband, Cristina Fernandez, Argentina's president, has enjoyed widespread sympathy among the public that has boosted her popularity rating by 20 points to more than 50 percent, the highest level since her election in 2007.
Still, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández sets aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional revenue at their discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have clashed with Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will give the President even more leeway in spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1 per cent, but numerous private estimates, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, put it at around 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is customary.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems the prelude to the cleaning up of INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term ends, considering that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to calmly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving closer to a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, turned out on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors of five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has favored full independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes to KMT's 45%.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PDP tied with the KMT in the town halls.
The elections showed typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and lightly clad girls dancing.
There was also the mysterious assassination attempt of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PDP and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not discussed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public accommodation and job creation schemes.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
As a result, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time too, the PDP avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but first things first.
It is best to wait until the 2012 presidential elections for this.
In any case, the PDP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as the DPP's candidate for president, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to create a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PDP will have difficulty choosing among its possible candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
Mr Ma's valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large DPP displays suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Breakthrough Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best New Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope," the nomination is sobering, but respects Grammys rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of said artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a breakthrough and, considering his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003.  the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately concentrated on jazz for this category.
In all other categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity," an exciting and magnificent album that was a favorite last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's savage punk Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the great group category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways," was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Direction of Classic Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations went to Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," for piano and orchestra, in five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse," a work for eclectic three-movement orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are divided into thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Royal Concertgebouw Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4; Daugherty for the Nashville Symphony Orchestra's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony"; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and chorus; and Arthur Sullivan for BBC National Orchestra of Wales' "Ivanhoe".
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble, on mandolin.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The vocal soloist nominees are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordination commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project, saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was spent on people interceding for or against the center, roughly the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," one of the comments read.
"It's about another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centers have sparked protests in other parts of the country as well, including near ground zero, the area of New York where the Sept. 11, 2011, attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together in Riverside County for years, but he wanted more and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it proves that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, though it's not far from being a truly 'alien' kind of life form," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report published online Thursday in Science.
There have long been six major elements essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to power their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes.  United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has elevated arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, so to speak, clumps down the biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus, but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that an arsenic-using life form may naturally exist, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus isn't new, but no example has ever been found to show it works.
Arsenic was more common in Earth's earliest eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there may be other means of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," Whitmore said.
"They are in good shape."
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to display at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs' Japanese owners, remained missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be displayed at other competitions planned for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month tour participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a baby boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, who were microchipped to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan "pre-assembled" by creditors to erase roughly $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a scaled-down studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which it is contributing $75 million on its own, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The firm's restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to get its finances in order as it struggled to make $300 million a year in interest payments.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial travails and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors sought.
Before spring of this year, he returned to the drawing board as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films coming out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its gift budget
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and one Kinect set costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been at work; This year's tech toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And toys powered by button cells are on the rise, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs ($13, for 3 years and older) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic dummy plays turn-changing games like Simóm Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
Children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and older), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a car ride into a session with a witty self-correcting workbook.
If you are wary of giving your child his smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; While the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it's the first major tune-up in the Leapster lineup, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; It is formidable for an impromptu word-building competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix' N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6-12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered microrobots.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to do a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even hang out inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement is promoted in China
Like an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin set the pace in a city square, sternly inspecting the nervous people in his charge, quietly issuing orders with military authority.
He wanted the female chengguan members, China's burly urban policemen, feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and penchants for violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, she whispered, "what pretty girls are like!"
Four girls who barely made their teens in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to attract attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city mandated that all new recruits have a bachelor's degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: In 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward snack cart, and watched it with a constant frown for half an hour, until the street vendor gathered his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's slightest respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news outlets routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after he used his cellphone to film them breaking up a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors in Beijing was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon peddler suffered brain damage after a scuffle with five officers.
A violence-filled video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say the current approach is a long way from this.
After the district solicited through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had royal duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district ad asked for female candidates ages 18 to 22, with a good figure "and all five harmonious facial features."
They had to be above average tall, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women over 25.
"Your image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament "and inner qualities."
Female chengguan are like vases, he said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to endorse that description.
But he noted that height demands were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not appear.
"We can't allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, with his cheeks red and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, Xu Yang, 21, said "Our work should present the image of the city."
They also don't object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply scaring away salespeople in the alleys where their business is supposed to be circumscribed.
Every morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who jump on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before being kicked out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told you many times!" Miss Xu said as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is pretty much the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumor spread that chengguan officers had killed a vendor.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, elbowed their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stood behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we struggle physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time it's the audience that starts the fight."
Prosecutors Will Not Bring Charges Against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Sen. John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely pleased" by the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of their investigation and that it has no plans to bring charges against him over this issue."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, email, and other documents first released in the October 2009 New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, obtain lucrative lobbying work to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton work and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was barred under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution against former Sen. Ted Stevens.  amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "hammering" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first broke last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the lines of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, is set to come to an official end, with the judge's imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments for the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the process, including the extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exaggerating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
State Superior Court Judge Jon C. Blue laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news outlets were "carefully controlled" and that there was no proof the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the issue.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that heard Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test potential jury reactions, showing them grisly photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and had incorrectly pushed for a verdict for its bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not seized.
But their arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a recusal of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually added fuel to the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily crowding of tweets from media, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state."
His attention on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that immediate news was more important than more slowly delivered reports was a Luddite vision that would make the court's policy on controlling coverage weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often drawn to arguments about accommodation that was required in courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of coverage of the trial, and made clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the XXI century".
Can civility bridge divisions?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, some civility has been unleashed this week in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone is saying, it was at least a polite discussion about the two sides' differences, as well as an acknowledgment of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to score partisan points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was similarly civilized, despite remaining political differences among members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are on a trial period, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and compromise, as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for renewed partisan warfare.
Reason why Tuesday's meeting and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and deeply entrenched to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Still, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that things have changed with respect to the way we say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make believe they favor tax cuts for the wealthy, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is heightened optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with ratification of the new nuclear disarmament pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th. Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he stated that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things that need to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) that civility can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As aware as Republican leaders are of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and strike down the new health care law.
Those party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, by their own assessment, have forcibly put the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to release their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House Republicans and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people closely.
Whoever they think is losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely a prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. Document Portrays Moscow as Corruption Paradise
Control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the "vertical authority," takes its part as money climbs up the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The Moscow city government's direct links with criminality have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government," the statement said.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that pierces the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's underworld."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; Even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their businesses closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, likely filled with cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, head of Indem's think tank in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He doesn't belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy note, which did not happen until late at night Moscow time, is sure to cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is fixing the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng Middle School remembered the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those developments, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng's Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-90s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, foot soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to be self-sufficient."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent sultry afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court summoned her she would not show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, though experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to put the broken pieces back together," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," at 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone salesman, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, Belarus' government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the issue.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with a low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential détente.
It stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners bound for Guantanamo through Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," Aguirre said in a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than about the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle the case between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit," he had instructed his aides "to avoid inflammatory rhetoric in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government."
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "burden" of being a mother
The young woman talked about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since childhood, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the town of A Coruña from which she is a native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician woman, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
It didn't take long for him to meet another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the child with my mother, I'll pick him up when I come back," she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a job so as not to lose it."
He clarifies that if all goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he should, that is, with me, and never in my life will it occur to me to leave him again with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.

The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether there is an advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles that received in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his relay at the head of the Diputació de Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain a majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the overturn in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been only 500 votes behind the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commissariat in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level has been "weakened" and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in EU territory will be carried out in the coming days blows similar to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who directed from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the middle of the investigation it is stressed that, at the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the fiscal agreement
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philo-sovereignty adventures, such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the middle of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that gives having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough figure to be loved, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstains in the investiture vote.
A possible entente with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for now, the conversations that Mas is holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in a Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it will be necessary to park all the sovereigntist and independence speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to slimming down the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with, on behalf of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elderly people
Those responsible for the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was employed there killed at least eleven elderly people in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible. "
And it is that in addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the warden in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly denied this and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by any person other than the accused himself."
The already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by puncturing him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center has access to medicines.
The insulin sticks and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyzes that are being done in the laboratory that must clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the statements of the guard, nor even to the number of murders confessed, which they do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed,  successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to get it wrong and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What has happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, just as it collapses, recovers but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the plan to purchase public debt as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of term liquidity and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying program and even signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God assist us!
As at their May meeting in which they said they had not even contemplated buying bonds and markets collapsed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said it had already bought a lot, triggering a new market crash.
Yesterday the auction of one-year bills in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the hole figures from Allied and Bank of Ireland have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to the markets sine díe.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being so, it must appear so."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not subside in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null and void", the judicial meeting of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm that owns Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was removed by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting of January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial meeting of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural trickery, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of rights, try to validate and clean up the radically null board of January 18 ", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting is held, it proceeds to challenge it considering that it is "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that must be decided by the judge once the hearing on the challenge application is held, for which there is still no date set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first nobody took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor from the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly lines for manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The workforce for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and their notoriety null.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R+D advances in wagon cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science since "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP personal systems said that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of store staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchase, service, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of liabilities.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its pending issue.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without having to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending issue, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks dare in these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it extend it one more year.
Customers who let savings banks escape will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of liabilities – which penalizes margins – is reducing, the price of risk premiums that banks and savings banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't turned off the tap, but the spreads are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads – see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of banks now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not surprisingly, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
"Next year everything is going to move," he said.
He affirms that capital needs are "raised a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds for new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The general director of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Banca Cívica group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too, "said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain ",  Emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of opinions quite unfortunate about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The executive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banks came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have prompted a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It goes without saying that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany there is beginning to be speculation about the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for offending countries, possible suspensions of payments by some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully prolonged the decision to rescue Greece.
Even then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should witness the process of reforming the Union that makes those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures have to be taken now, with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is signaling to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The challenge is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater calm.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order at home has made its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem that they will move it.
And, among the possibilities contemplated, that of leaving a currency zone too crowded with unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but no willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly engineered by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has led to rivers of ink being written about whether or not such behaviour is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes left in the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when drawing fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group, both players will serve the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different economic amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case is due to the fact that it has been carried out by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts nobility and honor, and that on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history as a histrionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; Well, in effect, they are actions that respect the sporting regulations, but they seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to sportsmanship.
One of the goods that comprises the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these goods that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that he did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because his violation of the rules was not done secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They hoped and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders obtain in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the rival is not placed at a disadvantage or benefit is obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players serve a sanction match and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against sportsmanship, which does include making strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or fleeing it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and fraud of law is blurred, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the directive to provoke them was transmitted.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-paid celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like nougat and lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer:  Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or lunches, agree the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (when New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean season began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers, today, does not dare to predict how the celebrations will be this month.
"People think long before booking."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the range around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various downtown establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th is verified.
In the Soteras group indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, they remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that reinvite their employees and a feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the Fecasarm employer (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that as a whole the reservations are "encouraged", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the celebrations has not decreased, whoever pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country."
The Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and juicy details they offer about the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored in components to make them difficult to destroy in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for vigilance in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists it in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is regarded, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain vigilance.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange's website is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high pace of Pakistani production of nuclear weapons.
An embassy dispatch in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparency is often non-existent; Offers of help go unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the person in charge that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called red notice free way to proceed with an arrest – which must be undertaken by the national police force – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England.  where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown himself willing to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son – Assange remains missing, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was reviled yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation call "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior official in the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views now proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the House Homeland Security Committee, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or aid."
Still further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to back down after saying Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should target it and use a drone or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind punishment," he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuation.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councilors of ERC will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
By means of ballots, and not by show of hands.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "a la Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand from the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But not having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the leadership will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that his goal is to make the organization capable of washing dirty laundry from doors inwards once and for all.
In this line, the article that the acting Minister Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació took it for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives."
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós' team, which already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task to the leadership to review the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, because the internal tide of recent years advised against facing the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to pick it up again and try to shut it down for good.

China Maintains Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and explained that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this matter.
He said that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; Institution building and support for pilot programs.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he added, several multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are underway or have already been concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Program, which was implemented during the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent bulbs by savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he added.
Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what suits his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was in accordance with the law and that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the inauguration of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, where appropriate, via complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge strengthened from the internal elections on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective," he said.
The PAN leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; On the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that National Action requires for the next three years, hence it will deliver the coin "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderon for his speech during the four years of his administration, Cesar Nava called on the PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend them; to come out," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama Promotes Pro-Immigrant Law on Twitter
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that a vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message came after all 42 Republican senators threatened to block voting on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is passed.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a calendar can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there is a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "close debate vote" on the Dream Act, so the bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as early as next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, stayed in the country for the past five years and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the bill, requiring the help of a handful of Republicans, as pro-bill organizations lobby to ensure passage of the bill.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, hold 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Sen. George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Sen. Mel Martinez's term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas but have said they will not endorse it another time.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where participants showed off the narration
"That of Sex on the tongue I understand but ... the finger on the sore? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los placeres de la lengua, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound... "It puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer snapped sweetly to the audience, mostly young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the "sore" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she leaves convinced: "patience is not my forte, maybe it is my sore".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; It is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist breathed a sigh of relief and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger on the wound is not named but in a moment it is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the Conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that lacked to the point of modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the crazy and the deceiver who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
He actually calls it the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"By his inheritance we are what is counted."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that crosses her country – and shares Latin America – as a result of disputes over drug trafficking and sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "that finger on the wound of the writer's committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also annoy the powers that prefer a world in black and white, "  he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the runner-up, he has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Apertura 2002 Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 on aggregate against Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with aggregate of 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penaltis shootout he took a 3-1 lead with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 somersault.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to suffer the same fate, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous final, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run away and I think that is a lesson,  Until the game is over, we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate made us a bad move,  Sometimes because of nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went away, that left us something for this final that we hope does not reach that instance. "
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up technician and taste for the first time the glory that titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; The cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to Visa Applicant Service (ASC) centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition-based visas (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay in the Consular Section less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $ 26.

NASA to announce finding of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause impact in the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will cause impact in the search for extraterrestrial life," which raised speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It is apparently a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at a press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' to the Chamber.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, the 'bipartisanship' begins, because now it will be two people, from an equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by PAN member Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms in an institutional way, political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, based on a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition is over.
"This is how far (the opposition coalition) has come, that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, now be "duopoly."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other comrades to make them more, the convergent added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that Congress has now become a "booty" between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just one game, now they are dividing it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, it is left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, right now to the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform. "
$200,000 more for "the provider"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of electrical material company.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "settlement of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had announced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, of November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos,  through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
They urge to attend tourist sites
Lament tourism entrepreneurs accident of foreign tourist by poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the disorder and turn around nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they would not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, for tourists to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Due attention has not been given and this type of event highlights something that is notorious by all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many sites and historical and cultural places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put in line to make them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Ask Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one more from the PVEM, which adds up to a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival troupes of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move forward the Ruler in turn.
"We see to it that they come to do a dignified job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation."
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it has within the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with agribusiness."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects that contribute to giving security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
A wizard king is wanted
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, next Three Kings Day it will be difficult to please their illusions, since their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and lives day to day because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Well, sometimes we look tough because my husband doesn't have a jacket, but we sell tangerine and potato... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
"He (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster,' but I told him 'let's see son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign A Wizard Wanted by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment intended for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
Around seventy officers from the Estrie Research Module of Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Illegal migration can be fought without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with clandestine migrants, is sure to face strong opposition, as all three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you tread," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone who comes from a ship identified as transporting clandestine immigrants for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not back the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against it and, apparently, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has dismissed with the stroke of a pen criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against those in charge of clandestine boats and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35," says Ms. Chow.
"We don't support the Conservatives' bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year," explains Ms Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each MP who will oppose it is then explained to their constituents.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York this issue since January of last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Consequently, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Stéphane Bergeron, critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public security, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the hat" and as "a botched last-minute solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he says simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in preventing the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this impasse, he suggested that Quebec should give a special mandate to the comptroller general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Comptroller General," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the financial controller the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel persons to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project in the making in the Charest government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it more adapted to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his counterpart in Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to biker groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since this precipitation is added to the melting of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec's Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentides and Chêne in Lotbinière have caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre, meanwhile, issued announcements Wednesday announcing the strong flooding of several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his foul language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate social assistance information, unduly negative representation of Haitians, and foul language that should not be used in daytime broadcasts."
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not infringe broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable and not misleading data.
In relation to suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question in 'Dupont le midi' have treated a sensitive subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made following the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI anchor stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of foul language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in prime time within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance to the professional level.
"In my case, I look for combat everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the ground game involved in mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championships, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai box categories," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been progressing in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Matches are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first bout, in the semifinals of his class (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who beat me is a true professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet in the final of their category."
"Next, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in direct contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender being carried out beforehand.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause prices to rise.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," Parti Québécois MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that collusion with this contract had occurred.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" way and "with a lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or several companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, considering the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition coming into play; This was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that what matters is not the price, but people's competition," Mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 won by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
Québec consumers hardly trust sustainable development actors, fair trade marks or green certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption abound, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their environmental advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates carrying so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about a third of Québec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they distrust the supposed returns of the ecological products or services that are tried to sell them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec's Homo consumus loves to take the place of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social conscience seems to be from doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants of this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinephile vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; This could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and an application for 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
It sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do demand considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried for ten years the load of the auteur cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had known how to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $ 700,000 to make their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these cinemas, the Parallèle, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The objective of future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27, screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of self-conscious Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. sees as the Canadians' complex vis-à-vis Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's sense of superiority toward Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This came as a great surprise to the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in Canadians in dealing with day-to-day domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the government's survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will run deficits for the first time in a decade due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to prorogue parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image transmitted by drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that tempers have heated up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "killed".
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode (LED bulbs), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top, they do not contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed reservations about fluocompact light bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact light bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly awaits election results announcement
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, given that deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the midnight deadline to pass Wednesday's deadline without the results being released, three days from Sunday's count.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there have been multiplied worldwide calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Côte d'Ivoire, said FN voter intimidation in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo's complaints.
But Gbagbo's opponents say the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the former rebels, has considered the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from releasing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the cake on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Côte d'Ivoire's political class that they could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on 31st October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with the unemployment rate rising further to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50, a figure that rises to 6.6% with the DOM.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions posed by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
Within the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached to him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, they questioned four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy CEO of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "influence peddling and passive corruption."
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "theft and embezzlement of public property by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations concentrate especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: The Elysée has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has had the public in suspense in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media into the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French commentary on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "continually drop" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often."
Because, once the attempts at negotiation through discreet channels are exhausted, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers."
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
It announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he points out that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which surrounds Iran's clandestine networks acquiring material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, has not only "been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" of the courts, he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, using communiqués and "escapes" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation bears fruit, since several newspaper articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials."
Why such "gratitude" to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite his praise-laden statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
Next, the document discusses the reasons that have led the Elysée to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can garner if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confides to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At the very least, this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, it thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government is adopting a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to online gambling after midnight for young people under 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family Affairs said.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he says.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people request it, he added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints host countries
Amid the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where struggles for influence and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions may therefore last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) bids have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the bonfire on Monday by airing a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have thrown themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the coup successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympic Games 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's luster to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (82 World Cup in Spain, JJ. OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, both countries' bleak economic and financial prospects could derail their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they achieve is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They are bringing out their dirty laundry, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorite.
The world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of pay TV rights (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One tenure on the Elysée leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not go well with the mystery often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, you always have to pretend to be in doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, believe it or not, Jacques Chirac's friends said he was not ruling out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP deputies, on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Far from it.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an advertisement.
It is not the first time that he speaks of the presidential elections, with a jocular tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, case, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had blurted out in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about what will come next."
His statements the day before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They elicit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to open up.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's entourage has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government bills
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, endorsed the active role played by the ECB in helping to solve the debt crisis of European states.
He declined to say whether he believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program to buy state bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the program of purchase of State Bills in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's purchase of Treasury bonds doubled last week to around €1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion worth of securities since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt in the least that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also don't foresee any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations longer than three months have now disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this mechanism to be extended today for a few months.
"I don't imagine it's going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the government bond market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds so that the market remains stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates go through the roof, states will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedging contracts (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing some stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of revenues associated with it, which means that the State runs the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a jug of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budgetary provisions may be applied after the holidays, amounting to 7,000 million euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for some time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested of Italy are less than those required of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will face a no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be brought forward at the end of March.
In such a case, it would open up an unfavourable period for decision-making in the event of a major crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis control mechanisms
Christine Lagarde already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their currency area."
Although relative, yesterday's easing in European state bond rates has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing exit mechanisms from the crisis.
Informal consultations among the most directly affected Finance Ministers and their G20 counterparts are generally on track.
This also takes into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-standard measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative confided to Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider essential to increase confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European government bond market, believe that an additional amount of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with 60,000 million euros.
A council that could certainly examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group in the evening.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows lightly on Île-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Lower Normandy, Île-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is heavy enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, have been banned from accessing several departmental roads.
According to the gendarmes, traffic on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
During Thursday, school transport has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measures had been planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday because of expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro du Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on transport's modernisation on the Île-de-France has reached its peak, billions have been pouring in.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To initiate this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euros.
At the theoretical level, this sum will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, examined in the National Assembly's finance committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of an excise duty on equipment and the increase of the tax on offices on the Île-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment revenue is created (the two taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised does not appear in the appropriation, may provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only looks like a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every dossier created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual mores only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi's ominously ridiculing profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only consist of publicly known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what do I know, editor of the Libération) is lazy (or has little eagerness), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as that published in Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations in these dossiers caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the Second World War and since Heads of State can call each other on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation,  They have been transformed into centers of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly, we just pretend that we do not know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of US diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "executioners".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, it could be conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets be endured?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in reality an empty secret, without secrecy, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has, and very much, done Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the Internet, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with today's technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my forecast is the stuff of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has recreated a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now (digital) CDs only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys that entails, we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being hatched in secret in embassies.
At present, it is embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's botched funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the rapidly released (so-called fast start) pledges made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French botches have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a large complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Operation transparency was appreciable and was appreciated for what it really counts: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease) while it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider every euro borrowed to be equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reductions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted towards their commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of grants (36.1 million euros); check the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A nice trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is abusing twice: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term minutiae in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move forward the discussions on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additionality" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast starts and its vision of "additionality" and lending utilization would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a statistically significant value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is a concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the meal, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even loaf of bread or chewing gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, tests discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these "pollutant cocktails" pose to the consumer "is likely underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
