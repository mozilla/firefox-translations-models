Have you ever imagined how to call or name someone who has no first or last name?
Hey!
Thou!
That word that identifies us Argentines so much, "che".
But I'm thinking of someone else who doesn't have a first or last name.
I'm thinking of that someone who lost his name and his surname, who disappeared his first and his last name, his identity.
Now in Argentina people are disappearing.
In the world, now at this moment, thousands of people disappear.
Some are disappeared who are alive, product of child trafficking, theft of babies, human trafficking, illegal adoptions.
Others are disappeared who have died: kidnappings, wars, drug violence, terrorist attacks, natural accidents and others not so natural.
It is necessary to return their identity, rewrite their name and surname.
Because we all have an identity, we have an individuality, an identity of individual, affective, family, cultural, group, country, but we also have a genetic identity.
Our identity is written in our genes.
Our genome, the human genome, is made up of four letters that are repeated 3 billion times.
Incredible!
But we are almost the same.
Almost the same!
To be exact, our genome is 99.9% identical to each other.
Only 0.1% of our genome allows us to distinguish or identify ourselves.
Now, 0.1% of 3000 million letters is no less than three million letters and that is a number.
Some books with three million letters can be written.
And that's what it's about, using the letters of our genome, rewriting the letters of the name and surname of those who lost their identity.
How do we do it?
Using genetics, comparing.
To identify necessarily is to compare.
To compare a father and a son, to know if they are linked in that relationship, I have to compare them.
And to know that there is a proportion of those letters that they have in common according to that kinship.
In the 80s, I had been working at the Hospital de Clínicas, in the genetics of transplants, looking for the maximum genetic compatibility between donors and recipients of organs to avoid graft rejection.
And you may ask, what does that have to do with identity?
It has to do and a lot.
And how much!
Because our organism, our immune system, is profoundly xenophobic.
It recognizes itself as such and tolerates and rejects everything strange.
And that's why we reject a virus, a bacterium, how much more are we going to reject an entire organ.
That's why we looked for those compatibilities, to avoid those rejections.
But these genes also allowed us, precisely because we did it between related relatives, to analyze and establish kinship links.
We had a problem in the 80s: we needed living cells from the two people we were going to compare, we couldn't analyze a bone.
That was a stumbling block.
But a decade later a revolution came to laboratories: we could now compare molecules.
We could extract molecules from a living, or dead, cell and compare them.
Then we took a step forward and could then identify a dead cell inside a body or a bone remnant.
And we gained some experience.
A decade later, precisely in 2003, something happened that changed my life, largely professionally and also in motivation.
A group of women and men, anthropologists and anthropologists, from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team arrived in Córdoba who had been walking through Argentina, exhuming graves, looking for causes of death, analyzing those bones, trying to identify them and return them to the families.
They were walking not only in Argentina, but in many countries of the world.
And they came to Córdoba to exhume a massive grave from the municipal cemetery of San Vicente.
A mutual friend met us at his house.
What did we do?
What many Argentines do when we get together: we ate a barbecue and there was wine too.
And then, having a few glasses of wine, I was shocked by the stories that these anthropologists told me because the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team is an NGO that works on cases of violation of universal human rights trying to identify people.
They told me stories from all the countries, but there, in that meeting, in that roast with that wine, we realized that they were in a stumbling block, there was a stalemate, they needed to incorporate a new technology into this complex process of identification and it was genetics.
So, we thought about joining forces and doing something in common.
I remember that at that moment we considered, let's try with the worst preserved rest of the San Vicente pit, with the rest more degraded, more deteriorated.
If we do well with that one, we will surely do well with the others.
And we did very well.
And the first identification of a skeletal remains of the dictatorship in Argentina emerged, in the San Vicente grave in Córdoba.
That filled us with joy and we said: "let's put a laboratory" and so it was done.
We set up a genetics laboratory where there are young guys who are working, I know, a lot.
And we started walking, we summoned relatives, we started crossing letters to rewrite names.
But not only in Argentina, because in Argentina we produced some identifications, others more from the cemetery of San Vicente, from the torture and death center of "La Perla", the identification of some of the founding mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who had been thrown into the sea and that the sea had returned them.
We also went out to walk the path they had been walking: Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, where there were also dictatorships and names and identities disappeared.
And further north, in Central America, El Salvador, the war of the 80s, and even further north, in today's Mexico, where thousands of migrants disappear every year from many countries, who crossing Mexico, want to achieve the dream of the northern country.
Also on other continents, Africa, for example, the South Africa that imprisoned Mandela.
And in Asia.
It all seems wonderful, doesn't it?
Everything went well.
But that's not the case.
Many times we stay in the middle.
Many times we have the remains, but so many years have passed that the relatives are no longer there.
And other times we have the relatives, but the remains are not found.
And other times, even if we have the remains, they are so deteriorated that we cannot decipher the letters to compare them with the relatives.
That generates a lot of frustration really.
I'm sure you know a well-known, very famous, popular TV series: CSI New York, Los Angeles, Miami.
In these series, the investigators, in hours, days, solve some very difficult cases.
That's not true, that's fiction.
The reality is different.
We call this the "CSI effect" because they generate a distorted picture of the complex identification process.
The most worrying thing is that they don't just do it over people popularly, but some government officials also believe it's so easy.
On top of that, they are all models.
Our reality... (Laughter) It's a little different.
(Laughter) (Whistling in the audience) (Laughter) (Applause) I am remembering about four or five years ago, I had to participate in a call that we had made in Mexico to relatives.
It was a call to a number of families who came to donate their blood samples to make a blood bank and compare the data with the number of graves that were discovered.
It was a very solemn atmosphere.
The relatives were serious, they came to donate their blood samples.
At one point, I finished taking a sample from a mother.
He stopped.
I was going to reach out to him to give it to him.
I looked at her, she was tiny, very native, dressed in her typical costume.
I extended my hand to her and she took it with both of us and brought her here and said, "Little doctor, please find it for me."
(Sigh) That request is a mandate.
It is because of this mandate-request that it is worth insisting and insisting on those complex cases that we cannot solve.
Obsessively insisting to try to produce a new identity, to be able to rewrite a name again, to return it to a family, to end the years of waiting, uncertainty, anguish and so that that little mother can meet her son again, even if her son is already dead.
Thanks a lot.
(Applause) (Standing ovation)
When I was five years old and starting to read, my dear grandfather Carlos Felipe gave me an adventure book.
"The Microbe Hunters", by Paul de Kruif.
In its chapters were Leeuwenhoek, Spallanzani, Koch, the one with the bacillus, Pasteur, men who with rudimentary microscopes sought to defeat the invisible enemy.
The book did not awaken in me the vocation for medicine or chemistry, but it did awaken my passion for history.
And, as a frequent traveler to the past, I wanted to tell you something about the pandemics that hit humanity.
We could speak of the fierce cholera of the second half of the nineteenth century, or of the smallpox that cost so much to master.
But there are two pandemics that were very marked by their fatal consequences.
In the fourteenth century, the Black Death, provoked by a louse that moved in rats.
He started in Asia and from there went to Venice, the most cosmopolitan port of his time.
That's how he got into Europe.
The mortality was between 25 and 50 million.
Out of every four Europeans, one was struck by the plague.
The numbers in Asia were quite similar.
Closer in time, in the twentieth century, the century of flu, we had in 1918 the Spanish flu.
Spanish flu that began in the U.S. with American soldiers preparing to go to the end of World War I and that infected the populations of the ports of France where they embarked.
From there it spread throughout the continent.
It started in the U.S. and came to Europe through France.
Why do we call it the Spanish flu?
Well, that was fake news.
Spain's government and press decided to confront the evil by bringing statistics to the surface.
Because of this honesty of the data and the numbers, they ended up being pointed out as responsible for something that did not correspond to them.
On that occasion, one in five infected died.
Look, in World War I, between 10 and 30 million people died.
The universal flu killed 50 million.
The world's population was reduced by 2.5% to 5% because of that pandemic.
We talked about cholera, smallpox, the Black Death, the universal flu and we could also add the yellow fever, of 1871, which hit the cities of Corrientes and Buenos Aires.
What did they all have in common?
That when they attacked us we were not warned.
We weren't prepared.
To make matters worse, in many cases it was not known where the contagion came from.
Therefore, responses and reactions were not effective in counteracting evil.
What did we learn from all those fatalities?
Something very important, that the danger of the virus is enhanced by misinformation.
Let me explain.
In the fourteenth century, instead of dealing with rats and poor hygiene, it was held that the sinful lifestyle of many had unleashed divine wrath.
In the twentieth century, instead of showing the true causes of that flu, reality was distorted and the bug was out of control.
In this way it spread over the five continents.
Therefore, we may have learned at once that we must deal with the truth.
As much as it hurts us.
Another of the great lessons on that occasion was that we will have to stay on guard even after the storm passes.
Because there have always been second and third waves that have taken the unsuspecting.
But, above all, we can venture wonderful times of growth.
Because after the Black Death came the Renaissance.
Because after the universal flu came the 1920s, the most fruitful and avant-garde of all time.
Yes, at the end of the tunnel, the sun awaits us.
Thank you.
I have two passions: one, football.
I'm a megafan, let's see if you guess which team?
(Laughter) Of course I'm a megafan of Real Madrid.
I am also a goalkeeper in the Villanubla futsal team.
The other passion is: computers, video games and programming, which is what I come to talk about today.
When it comes to playing, children are crazy about the Wii, the PSP, the Nintendo.
We always try to win some extra games, finishing homework first, tidying up our room, whatever it is to move to the next level or surpass our previous score.
One day I thought: What if instead of just playing those games I could create my own screens, heroes and bad guys, hits and pirouettes, extra lives?
Impossible?
Oh, no.
A child my age can do it.
While new technologies are everywhere and the elderly use them for things when they grow up, to see ... -- computers on board cars (although my parents sometimes still get lost), mobiles, check the mail, send messages, shop, surf the Internet -- children use them to play, that's why we are children and that's what we like the most.
But we all know that we, the children, are much better, how to say it?, those devices of the devil than many older people, perhaps because we are not afraid to touch them, to experiment with them, to see what is here or to spoil them, since then there are the parents to fix everything.
(Laughter) This curiosity that we children have helped me to be the creator of my own games and I realized that I could learn by playing and playing by learning.
I could experiment, create, share, understand and reason how things are made and then use it with what we were studying.
And it turns out that all that I was learning is what the elders call "creative computing."
Once I was told that programming is like a play: we have our stage where our actors are who will act among themselves as we tell them, we can disguise them to get animations or add images, sounds, etc. You will think: it looks very good, but a child alone, in his room, programming, is not very social to say.
But it is that it is much more.
It is a public and open community worldwide, to which we can belong and where we can publish our programs or download the programs already made to play with them, see how they have made them, modify them or improve them.
And, currently, in this community there are more than 10,000 shared programs, and to it belong children, not so children, and teachers of schools, institutes and universities.
I was getting more and more passionate.
I made new friends with whom I shared creations, and I thought that, if I taught it to the children at school, they could also enjoy it as I did.
In addition, programming also helped me to learn in a more fun way what we were giving at school.
So it was clear to me.
Last year, when we were giving the bones of the human body in class, it occurred to me to do a question and answer game, which is this: (Video) I'm going to show you this game I made about the bones of the human body for my school, when we were giving it last year, in which the human body asks you where its bones are.
We give the green flag, we put it on the big screen to make it look better, and it says: where is the jaw?
You have to answer with the correct number, if it is 10, 11, 1, 2, 3... Well, you answer with the 10 that is the correct one and it tells you: "biennnn" but if you answer wrong it says: "UA, UA, UA".
I have recorded the sounds and I have added them to the game too, and I have made there are successes and failures, that here I put the numbers of the successes and failures in order to be able to make competitions with my friends to see who knows better the bones of the human body.
(Applause) I had so much fun programming it and it helped me so much to learn it that I told my teacher and asked if we could see it in class, that I wanted to show it to everyone.
And so it was.
We organized a day in which I taught those projects and more to my classmates and taught them that they could also do it just like I had done.
As it could not be otherwise, they loved it.
Children and teachers liked it so much that this year we have founded the programming club "El páramo de Villanubla", where we are already 26 children who enjoy and program programs individually or as a team.
Now I'm preparing this game about space: (Video) I'm going to show you this game I've made about the planets of the solar system with the video sensor, in which you have to hit the planets with your head so that they do not fall into the sea.
We put it on the big screen.
I have made mistakes and successes and here is the sea.
The planets are falling and you point towards the camera, you move and you give them.
When you give them, you change the planet for its name and say it, and a success is added.
But when you don't give them, the sound of water sounds and a failure adds up.
Well, I think you've already seen how it works.
(Applause) Isn't that cool?
Well, I've done it and that's cooler to me.
I'm also going to pass it on to the 5-year-old children of my school who are doing a program about the planets of the solar system and I'm sure that with it they all learn them and that makes me feel happier because I know that my games serve for more things than to have fun alone.
But it's not the first time I've done something for the kids at my school.
As my parents saw that I liked it so much and I was doing so well with my studies, when I turned 7 they gave me something that when I saw it I said: what is this?
Some cables?
And they said, "With those wires you're going to be able to do magic."
And they were right and I'm going to prove it to you today.
It was a board called Makey Makey that when connected with a cable to the computer you could go clicking more cables to things as original as jelly beans, plasticine, fruits, pencil graphite, water or, just touching them, make programs and games work magically.
I told Marga, the 4-year-old teacher at my school, and she asked if we could do a special project about the music and instruments of an orchestra.
The children and their teachers would be in charge of making the cardboard and rubber instruments, while I had to make the necessary programs so that these instruments came to life and really sounded.
So I told Juanje, a friend of mine, and between the two of us we got down to work.
We thought it was a very interesting project, but it was a very difficult challenge because we had to make very young children listen to us, other children.
When we had everything ready, we gathered all the children of the infant cycle and taught them how their instruments really sounded.
We even taught them that they also had music inside.
It was mind-blowing!
The little ones were great.
We organized them in turns so that everyone could play their instruments.
Really, they looked at us as if we were magicians who with a few simple cables and a computer had left young and old speechless.
Well, do you want to see how we did it?
Well, I'm going to show you next.
Today I have brought here some of those instruments, which, by the way, I thank my school for leaving them to teach you a little of that magic, and what any child could do with a little imagination, some cables and a computer.
To play this super piano made by four-year-olds I have to take off my shoes.
I've got clean feet, huh!
(Laughter) Let's see if this song sounds familiar.
(Music) (Applause) And now I'm going to show you how water can make more sounds than it does when it comes out of the tap.
I'm going to dedicate this song to my grandmother who for next week is going to be her birthday.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) And then I'm going to need four volunteers because here and now we're going to see what they sound like.
Let's see, the four of you are very close.
(Laughter) (Applause) Get out there, you take this one and you take this one.
Let's see what instrument you sound (Noise) Go, you sound like a noise!
(Sound of cymbals) And you to some dishes.
No, you don't sound.
(Laughter) (Drum sound) You sound like a drum.
And you, to see what instrument you sound like.
(Sound of horse neighing) Oops, if a horse has sneaked into us!
(Laughter) (Applause) I hope you liked everything I've told you.
Do you see how he did not deceive you?
You imagine, create and share, and all with cables, a little imagination and a computer.
Cheer up boys and girls!
Stop being just game players and become creators of stories, games, programs, music projects...
There is no limit, only that of our imagination.
But do not stop there, show it to the world, send it to the web so that more and more of us enjoy, not only playing, but also knowing that we, the children, can also decide how we want things to be done.
And to you, the parents, I ask you, please, to set up programming workshops in schools so that no child is left without learning all this.
It is important for your children.
(Applause) And never forget and always believe that nothing is impossible, everything depends on our effort and desire to improve ourselves, and although we are very small we also have many things to teach others.
Thank you very much for your attention.
See you soon.
(Applause)
Without identity we cannot be in society.
The first thing people with disabilities lose when they are born is their identity.
They are labeled, renowned, by a diagnosis that does not speak of the person.
Stripping identity is the beginning of a series of humiliations according to culture, context, circumstances, which is repeated throughout the history of humanity.
And the school reproduces what the Spartans do when asked, in the presence of a student with a disability, what does it have?
But naming is an act of resistance.
And so the body becomes a sign.
And our children and our youth can be recognized.
So the right question is who is it?
The school has the power to appoint.
The school returns identity.
It has the power to restore the status of person.
As simple as that: School dignifies.
So, if we dream of an inclusive society, the key is in school.
(Applause) (Cheers)
I have a daughter who is 13 years old, but in 2012, when it was the financial collapse, that all the stock markets in the world fell and all that, she was five less than now, she would be eight, nine years old.
And we were watching the news, we were having lunch and watching the news and a guy with a bare tie appeared, a journalist who always gave bad news, he was the one who predicted the tsunami and that a plane fell, and that day he said: "Last minute, the stock market collapsed all over the world."
And my daughter looked at me like that and I turned pale.
And the rate followed, he says: "The face value of the bond skyrocketed because it could not sustain the debt obligations."
And my daughter was looking at me.
(Laughter) "Investment banking collapsed," he said, "shareholders are committing suicide."
And my daughter opened her eyes big and so did I.
Obviously I was scared because something serious was going on.
And then Nina, my daughter, who always asked me what the tsunami is, what is the plane that went down and it was easy to explain the tsunami: it's the epicenter of a thing in the sea that Filipinos later die, it's simple.
(Laughter) He asked me, "What is this that happened now, Dad, is it serious?"
And I realized I had no idea how to explain to a guy what that was.
An earthquake is easy to explain, but how do you explain to a child the collapse of the financial system?
You can't explain it to them because it's intangible, more than anything.
But since I'm "hard-headed" and in my spare time I'm a writer too, I set out to do it, so I wrote a children's story.
And the next day, when we were watching the news again and he asked me again, I told him a story that I want to share with you. I told Nina that day that there was once a very quiet village and that there was a boy named Pepe, the protagonist, who lived in the house furthest from the village.
One afternoon, Pepe went for a walk and became thirsty.
When he returned home, he opened a bottle of wine and, while drinking the wine, discovered one thing that no one had ever discovered: there were no bars in the village.
There wasn't even a bar.
Pepe thought that if he opened a bar, he could make others happy, giving them a drink, and he also thought that he could earn some coin.
And he was happy with the idea of opening a bar.
That afternoon, his friend, Moncho, stopped by Pepe's house and gave him a good name for the bar.
And it is already known that when an outdated idea has a name, that idea already begins to walk.
Then Pepe made a list of needs to open the first bar in town.
Nina looked at me with her eyes open, the story was fine so far.
Pepe realized that he had to buy tables, chairs, drinks, paint, a palenque so that the customers of the bar could put their horses and could enter to drink.
And he did the math and all that was going to cost him about 10,000 coins.
Of course, Pepe didn't have 10,000 coins because he was poor, but overnight he came up with a way to get those 10,000 coins.
Pepe cut 1000 pieces of paper and wrote on each piece of paper the phrase: "Coming soon, Bar de Pepe"; 1000 times he wrote that.
And on Sunday, after Mass, he went to the town square dressed in his best suit and said to all the neighbors in the square: "Dear neighbors, I am going to open a bar on the outskirts of town."
Everyone looked at it.
"What a good idea!"
Some said.
Pepe felt very good with everyone's attention and then he showed, in a fan, the 1000 pieces of paper cut and said: --"this is important, Nina" I told him-- Pepe said: "Each of these 1000 pieces of paper costs 10 coins."
The neighbors were looking at him.
"Whoever buys me a piece of paper is going to have to keep it because in a month, when I open my bar, I'm going to pay 12 coins for every piece of paper you give me back."
Then there were whispers all over the square and Moncho, who was the fool of the town, asked: "Stop, Pepe!
But doesn't it cost 10 coins each piece of paper?
Why are you going to give away two more coins later?"
And Pepe said: "It's not giving away, Mocho, it's compensating.
I'm going to compensate with two more coins to help me fulfill my dream, which is to open a bar."
Then the mayor, who was out there, came over and said, "It makes sense!
It makes perfect sense.
Very good, Pepe!"
And Ernesto, who was rich and understood business, said: "To me, the idea seems very good."
And the priest Ricardo, pulling some coins from under his cassock, said: "It's a very Christian idea!
I want some of your papers."
And everyone started buying Pepe's papers.
In that simple way, and in a single morning, Pepe got the money to open his bar.
Among all the neighbors they bought him the 1000 pieces of paper.
"I bought him two," Sabino said, who was poor but optimistic.
"I bought him 36," shouted Quique, who was greedy and haughty.
Pepe went home with 10,000 coins in his backpack and fell asleep thinking about his dream: to open a bar.
The next day was Monday and Pepe traveled to the city and bought wood to build a counter and bought paint, went home and got to work.
He did not pass through the town square for the next four weeks.
That is, I told Nina, Pepe did not know about the disaster that was going to be made because of his papers.
At that point in the story I braked and stared at my daughter to see if she was understanding the story.
You always have to "test" the metaphors with the boys, especially when they are complex ideas, and she told me: "Dad, this has nothing to do with what the skinny man said on TV, but it's good, I continued."
(Laughter) Then I told him.
I told him what happened in the village during the first week.
That Monday, the square was full of people, much more than on a normal Monday.
Many neighbors had spent the whole night cutting out their own pieces of paper because they had also discovered that they had projects that they could not fulfill due to lack of coins.
Some pieces of paper read: "In short, Heladería de Horacio".
Other pieces of paper read: "Very soon, Carmen's hairdresser."
And there were even some pieces of paper written by Moncho with spelling mistakes, which said: "At the end of the month, I will plow biajes to the Moon."
(Laughter) Suddenly, the neighbors climbed on the lampposts in the square so that the other neighbors could buy those little papers.
They climbed into the fountain to exchange papers for coins.
Tuesday was even worse and on Wednesday you could no longer walk through the square of the "quilombo" that there was.
The mayor had to put order and enabled a closed place in the municipality so that the neighbors could meet to exchange papers without destroying the square.
This small place was inaugurated on Thursday and was baptized with the name of "the hall of the papers".
And so it was that on Friday, everyone who had a project had already obtained the necessary coins to carry it out and had set to work.
Horacio was already looking for milk, cream, ice for his ice cream shop, Pepe was already sawing the wood for the bar counter.
Carmen sharpened the scissors for her brand new hairdresser and Moncho had bought two skinny horses to make trips to the Moon.
(Laughter) Only a group of neighbors remained in the paper room who had never thought of any interesting project in their lives.
The only thing these neighbors had were other people's papers.
One of these neighbors, Ramon, complained loudly, "Gee!"
Said.
"Now I need coins to buy cigarettes and I don't have any.
A few days ago, I exchanged my last 10 coins for a piece of paper from Pepe and now I need to smoke."
"The same thing happens to me," Luis said, "I want to go to the movies, I don't have a coin."
The complaints were growing until Sabino, who was cunning, picked up his little piece of paper and said: "Let's see, guys, in three weeks, Pepe is going to pay 12 coins to whoever returns this piece of paper that I bought at 10.
I sell my paper right now for eight coins!"
And the others looked at him, said "Oh!"
"Deal done," said Ernesto who was rich, but he wanted to be even richer and took the paper out of his hands, for eight coins.
Ramón and Luis also sold their papers for less than 10 coins and, while one ran to buy cigarettes and the other went to the movies, the other neighbors saw that this was a new way of doing business, although they would never have thought of a real idea in their lives.
Some climbed on the chairs, others on the tables.
They began to offer what they had and even the priest Ricardo came from the church sad and said: "Friends, the day Moncho put his papers on sale, I, who am a Christian, bought him a few because he is stupid.
Now Moncho sells them for 7 coins and says he is going to return 20 coins, but he is silly and wants to make trips to the Moon.
Now I need coins to fix the bell tower and nobody wants to buy me Moncho's papers."
"I'm sorry, Father Ricardo," everyone said, "we can't buy.
How is that boy going to go to the moon?"
Then the priest left the room with Moncho's papers, with his head down, and it was the first time in many years that no one was helping him repair the church.
And so the first week passed.
Then I looked at Nina, who said, "Now I think it's starting to look like what the guy on TV said."
And I say, "Sure!
In the real world the paper room is called 'the stock exchange', while the paperwork can have two names.
They can be called 'bonds', in some countries, in other countries they are called 'obligations'.
The 12 coins that Pepe is going to pay when the bar works, or the 20 coins that Moncho says he will pay when he travels to the Moon, are called 'face value of the bond.'"
And Nina looked at me like this.
(Laughter) He opened his eyes big because he understood the girl, eight years old.
Then I told him what happened the second week in the village.
I told him that Pepe's house no longer looked like a house, Pepe's house looked like something else.
In the dining room there was a wooden bar, the bathroom had been converted into two bathrooms, one for ladies, one for gentlemen.
The walls were half painted navy blue and Pepe was very happy with the progress of his bar.
Since he had not yet gone to town, Pepe, he still did not know that the life of his neighbors was a "quilombo" of pieces of paper that came and went changing price and owner.
Even the mayor, after discussing it with his secretary, decided to join the new fashion.
One Tuesday morning, the mayor went out to the balcony with a megaphone and said: "Neighbors, the square was damaged after the furor of the papers.
I need to raise funds to fix the destroyed streetlights, to renovate the fountain and to buy a motor car.
From this moment, I put on sale 1000 official papers".
"How many coins cost?"
Sabino asked.
"No coins!"
Said the mayor, "My papers cost a horse.
When the fountain pours water, when the street lamps give light again and I have a motor car, I will return two horses per piece of paper.
The official papers are on sale from now on, run out of time."
The mayor's papers were sold in record time.
Everyone in the village gave their horses to the mayor and, from that day, the tasks began to be done on foot.
Meanwhile, the exchange of papers continued to increase and the pencils to write down who owned what were no longer enough.
Some papers were very desired, for example, those of Pepe who worked day and night in the realization of his bar, but other pieces of paper nobody wanted, for example, those of Moncho because his artifact to make trips to the Moon, for the moment, only consisted of two horses and a cart.
No one believed that this would begin to take off.
Ernesto, the rich neighbor who had bought many pieces of paper during the first week, now wanted to get rid of Moncho's papers.
And, as he also had Pepe's papers, he invented something very good to what he baptized: "the bundles of Ernesto".
They were closed packages with 100 pieces of paper of all colors.
For example, there were 10 pieces of paper from Pepe's bar upstairs, 20 pieces of paper from Horacio's ice cream shop in the middle and 70 pieces of paper from Moncho's lunar project below, without anyone seeing them.
On Thursday of the second week, Ernesto's bundles were a great success among the neighbors who were looking like crazy for papers from Pepe or the mayor, but on Friday, Quique discovered the trick and said: "Careful, neighbors, careful!
Ernesto's bundles sometimes come with Pepe or mayor's slips at the top and that's fine, but at the bottom of the package there are many pieces of paper from Moncho who will never make any trip to the Moon in his fucking life.
So before buying bundles of Ernesto seek my advice.
My fee for each piece of advice is two coins."
(Laughter) Since then, paper buyers have always consulted Quique before buying bundles from Ernesto.
Ernesto and Quique, who had been friends for many years, stopped talking to each other forever.
And so the second week passed.
By now, Nina was almost an expert on this whole thing.
I explained that in the real world the mayor's official papers are called "public debt securities."
I explained that Ernesto's bundles are called "debt obligations," while Quique's house, the place where neighbors go to find out whether or not they trust Ernesto's bundles, is called "investment banking."
Then I told Nina that, when the third week in the village began, some projects were almost finished and, on the other hand, others were still in diapers.
Pepe only needed to nail the palenque so that the neighbors' horses grazed outside the bar.
Horacio had managed to beat milk and fruit for his ice cream shop and he only had to bring ice bars from the city.
On the other hand, Carmen had not yet found a good place to set up her hairdresser, although she already had dozens of sharp scissors.
And what about Moncho?
Poor Moncho.
His horses were getting skinnier and sadder, though he brushed them day and night, and it didn't look like his artifact could fly for less than a week.
The neighbors who had little papers of Moncho or Carmen were restless and could no longer sell them to anyone.
Until Quique came along with a great idea.
"Hey!"
Quique said.
"Those who still have Moncho papers, don't worry.
I can sell them "Quique's tranquility" for those little papers.
"And what is that?
Sabino asked, who had a lot of Moncho's papers.
"Very easy," Quique said.
"Whoever has Moncho's papers pays me two coins every night from here to the end of the month and if Moncho does not manage to make trips to the Moon, I pay the 20 coins promised by Moncho."
"Even if Moncho fails?"
everyone asked.
"Even if it fails!
" Quique said.
"Tremendous idea!
Sabino said, "this way we will feel much calmer and we will be able to buy more pieces of paper from the village fool."
"That's why my idea is called 'Quique's tranquility,'" Quique said.
And many neighbors began paying Quique two coins a night to secure Moncho's project.
In the midst of the euphoria over these new ideas, no one in the village noticed that the mayor had never fixed the street lamps or the fountain in the square.
The mayor had fulfilled only part of the promise: he had escaped from town with a motor car.
That was all he had done.
And the only horses left in the village were Moncho's.
All the others had been taken away by the mayor.
The secretary, who had been the mayor's right-hand man and knew about the scam from the beginning, decided to do something so that no one would discover the absence of his boss.
And his idea was great: He brought a blackboard to the paper room and began to put a note, from one to ten, to each project.
He put an eight on Pepe's bar, Carmen's hairdresser on a five, Horacio's ice cream shop on a seven.
To the vehicle to make trips to the Moon of Moncho he put a two and, becoming distracted, to the reforms of the mayor's square he put a nine with fifty.
"What do these numbers mean?
Sabino asked.
And the secretary said: "They are the possibilities of realization of each project.
It's to help, I do it for you." And so the third week passed.
At this point, I explained to Nina that in the real world, Quique's idea of offering peace of mind on Moncho's papers is called "debt default insurance" and the big blackboard where the secretary puts a note on each project, in the real world, is called "rating agencies", which sometimes make mistakes without wanting and sometimes they make mistakes wanting.
Then Nina asked me if Pepe had finally managed to open his bar because we were already in the fourth week and I told him the end of the story.
The end of the story goes like this: When the fourth week arrived and the month was fulfilled, Pepe got up very early and walked calmly to the village.
From afar, you could see the façade of his bar with the illuminated sign at full throttle.
The bar was called "La Luna", as Moncho had baptized it on the first day.
Now all that remained was for the neighbors to arrive on horseback, their throats dying of thirst.
Pepe traveled the five leagues to the town putting signs on all the trees along the way: "Bar La Luna, open every night."
Every sign he put up, he went far away and stood proudly looking at the sign.
However, when he arrived at the town square, he didn't understand anything about what was going on.
He thought he had gone the wrong way and was in a different village.
It seemed that the war had passed through those people.
The street lamps and fountain in the square were smashed, there was not a single horse in the streets, and the neighbors walked round talking to themselves.
"What happened here?"
Pepe asked Horacio when he saw him.
"Alas!
Pepe," Horacio said in tears.
"Oh, Pepe.
Everyone went crazy with the papers, with mine, with Carmen's, with yours, with everyone.
Suddenly, there began to be more pieces of paper than coins and the mayor ran away from town.
Then there were no coins.
Later the horses disappeared.
Ernesto's bundle sellers went bankrupt.
Quique's resellers of tranquility could not pay anyone and escaped into the night.
We're broke, Pepe."
"And your ice cream project?"
Pepe asked.
"And Carmen's hairdresser?"
"No, mine was a failure," Horacio said.
"There are no horses to go ice in the city and the ice cream melts.
And Carmen has no customers.
Everyone is pulling out their hair alone.
What do they want a hairdresser for?"
Pepe was silent, he couldn't believe what they were telling him.
Then Horace said, "Oh, for God's sake!
I need something strong."
And Luis said, "Me too, my throat is dry."
And Sabino asked, "Pepe, did you open the bar you wanted to open or not?"
And others also came to ask about the bar.
Pepe then discovered that, without a horse, no one would ever be able to go to his bar on the outskirts of town and he also understood that he could never return the 10,000 coins to anyone.
And then he saw Moncho in the middle of the square.
Moncho's two skinny horses were the only animals left and dragged three carts, with two wheels each, in the form of a train.
Many neighbors were getting into those cars and others made a long line, waiting to get on.
"Moncho!"
Pepe asked, "Where are all these people going?"
And Moncho said, "Where is it going to go?
To your bar!
To the moon."
Pepe saw a sign hanging in the broken fountain that read: "Moncho makes trips to the Moon.
Outputs: one currency.
Come back: free."
"But Moncho!"
Pepe asked, "Did you know that everyone was going to run out of horse?"
"No," said Moncho, "I only know one thing: What I know is that people can go to a bar on horseback, but no one can come back drunk and riding a horse."
"And since I don't drink, I thought my business might be to take them and bring them from the moon."
Then Pepe hugged Moncho, got into the first car and shouted: "Let's all go to the moon!
Free drinks the first night," and the whole town went up and clapped.
Nina even applauded happily the end of the story.
And then I told my daughter to be careful because in the real world the stories of the Pepes who try to open bars, or the stories of the Monchos who want to make trips to the Moon and nobody understands them, are almost always projects that do not usually have a happy ending as in children's stories.
Because in the middle Quiques appear, mayors appear, Ernestos and secretaries appear and they always spoil everything.
But when one of these projects does work, I told my daughter to finish, when these projects work, when something magical happens and they work, they are called "dreams" and they are usually wonderful.
(Applause) Thanks a lot.
(Applause)
You probably remember this image of Chancellor Angela Merkel taking a selfie with a refugee.
This image and others like it raised blisters in the German parliament and in many European parliaments, putting the European Union in check.
From the beginning there was no consensus among the German population in the face of such an avalanche of refugees from the Middle East, on their way to Europe.
The welcoming culture fostered by Angela Merkel from the beginning was not always valued by everyone.
From the beginning there were people who supported her and others who did not.
The people who do not currently support her, there are more and more, there are more and more detractors, and this is going to take its toll on Angela Merkel, obviously.
I do not want to go into detail about Angela Merkel's political future, but I would like to mention that she, for me, is one of the political people today who has a moral authority despite her mistakes, which most current politicians lack.
This is a graph showing the number of refugees who entered Germany over the past year.
The first group is from Syria, followed by the group that came from Iraq, and the group that came from Afghanistan.
According to a UNICEF report released just two weeks ago, half of those fleeing war are children.
The discourse against refugees is well known: "They are going to Islamize us."
"We are letting terrorists in."
"We're losing our identity."
And it is true that there are also people who are very much in favour or empathize with people fleeing war, but I can also see that among these people there is a kind of hiding behind the mistakes of politicians in order not to act, not to participate in initiatives that can, if not solve, at least alleviate these serious personal tragedies.
In the informal discourse and in the official discourse, learning German stands out as key to the integration of refugees.
I'm from Barcelona, I'm a linguist.
I have been living in Cologne, Germany, for four years, and for me language learning is also a key factor to be able to integrate, but not only for refugees it is a key factor, but for all immigrants in general.
I have been researching different aspects of language in multilingual environments for several years, and for me language is not a final product that can be mastered.
For me, language is a process that changes throughout life, throughout the personal experiences we have.
Obviously, language is a powerful instrument of integration, of inclusion, but also a powerful instrument of social exclusion.
If, for example, you have poor language proficiency or have a foreign accent, or a certain dialect from a region, or, perhaps, you have some kind of disability that affects your oral language production, such as stuttering, these are all examples that influence how people will accept you or marginalize you in a society.
The use of language and identity is not something static, it is something that is changing.
It's not like fingerprints, which is what accompanies you all your life.
Identity is something that is created or forged based on the values and beliefs that your family gives you, your friends give you and also goes according to what you really want to be, and what you really want to be is based on your motivation, the feeling of belonging you have with other groups with which you feel related or identified and also depending on the interactions with groups that are totally different from you.
Free German lessons are offered in refugee centres in Germany, and one might think, it is natural to think, that these people should be happy to be able to receive these German courses and also that they should be grateful.
But the absence of adolescent girls in these German groups, in these activities, is really significant.
Put yourselves in a situation: these girls carry a lot of burden, many post-traumatic disorders, due to an exodus, to a land that nobody had promised them, they have seen how their loved ones were murdered, they have seen how their houses were burned or bombed, others unfortunately have also witnessed or victims of rape in their particular transfer from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria on their way to Europe,  or road in this case of Germany.
If you put yourself in their shoes, would you feel like taking German classes or anything else?
To make matters worse, the families of these girls, parents, siblings or other relatives, prevent them from participating in these activities because they think that, perhaps, they will harm them even more.
And the question is: What can be done so that these girls begin to participate in this new society and that they can integrate?
This is the question we made four friends: with the red sweater, Sandra, then there is me, Lina and Peter.
All four of us, for different reasons, have a lot to do with adolescence.
Peter and I, for having fifteen-year-old daughters.
And Sandra and Lina, for also working with this group, adolescence.
We thought: what if we do a project where it is not only attractive to refugee girls, but also attractive to German girls?
Could we manage to unite them?
Could we create a space for them to interact and perhaps contribute to transforming their identity?
Thus was born the initiative of HalloFoto!.
It is an intercultural project for adolescent girls between 13 and 17 years old.
The objectives of this project were: to develop... Well, first create these spaces of interaction to be able to develop communicative skills.
And the creative skills of the girls.
We thought: if we develop both, we will surely create the possibility for them to develop intercultural competences as well.
Obviously, to develop communicative skills you had to go through learning German, there was no other, and we used a novel method: augmentative communication boards.
Augmentative communication boards are aids for people who are nonverbal, that is, people who do not have oral language.
This condition can occur from birth, for example in the case of children with severe autism spectrum disorders, or for example in children with cerebral palsy.
This condition can also occur when you are an adult, because you have a stroke or because you have an accident, or because you suffer from a neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's.
These boards that we use for the project are composed of pictograms and core vocabulary.
The core vocabulary is the words that are repeated most in the spontaneous language and this happens, not only in German, but also in Spanish, Catalan, Basque, English, etc.
The truth is that the girls accepted these instruments very well, and the data collected in the project show that yes, they value it positively.
In any case, for them this is not what is decisive to learn German, to have dreams, to be motivated, to really want to participate in this new society.
For them, what is really significant are the meetings that we form, that we organize in HalloFoto!, in our project.
They are intercultural encounters because we were encouraging face-to-face interaction of groups with totally different frames of reference.
This, for example, is the image of one of the encounters.
We organize these intercultural meetings by theme and the themes were decided by them.
This is the theme "Makeup and hairdressing".
In another of the meetings we went to an adventure center where there were zip lines, there were balance games, tunnels.
The issue was not to create fear, but to overcome fear.
Together they were helping each other, and it was not a question of who was more afraid or less afraid, which group was the most afraid or less, it was simply each in its own expression.
You see it in their faces, they can't define who's who, the one who is afraid.
The fact is that in this, along with other encounters... —This is the meeting we did about cooking.— they see meaning.
And it is in this construction of meaning that generates a sense of miscegenation, a feeling of creating links, intercultural developments that go beyond labels.
The labels only generate stereotypes and generate prejudices that do not account for the great wealth that each one of us is, or that each one of us has.
In addition to communicative skills, we also wanted to develop creative skills.
Creativity is the affective and cognitive expression of each individual.
And if we activate that expression together, first, a space is developed to generate things, first unthinkable, which are miscegenations of expressions where we can already begin to see how an intercultural competence is being forged.
That's why these photography workshops were held, to generate this creativity.
The photography workshops were done by Peter and Sandra, who are the photographers of the group.
And these are the photos that the girls took throughout the project.
Sometimes they posed and sometimes they were photographers, they decided.
And when you see these photos you think: where is the "they"?
Where is the "we"?
The borders are very diluted.
How do we define ourselves?
We found the photos so beautiful that we thought we should do an exhibition.
But we didn't want to do an exhibition to use, we didn't want to do an exhibition in a museum or in an art gallery.
We wanted to move our photos, our exhibition, to an urban space and we had a vision.
This is the computer recreation of our vision: we wanted our girls to be on a tram, the tram of desire.
Our desire was to have a platform, a platform that would be a political statement against sexism and against xenophobia.
We presented it to public transport in Cologne and they were quite enthusiastic about the project.
And at the beginning of July, last July, the tram with the photos of the girls was presented.
(Applause) The project was much more successful than we imagined.
In fact, the press highlighted us as an exemplary project, to counteract the xenophobic tendencies that are sadly increasing, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe.
Likewise, there were many people who asked us if they could replicate the project, if they could make their special HalloFoto!.
And for this reason we think: we are going to license it, so that everyone can use it.
That is why the project is in Creative Commons, and from this scenario, from TEDxValladolid, I invite all those who want to participate and launch their own project, to do so.
(Applause) And it's not what we have taught, the four people on the team, but what the girls have taught us.
All the participants in the group have shown us ways to communicate and ways to interact.
First, they break stereotypes.
Second, they create bridges.
That they have also generated transformed, powerful and intercultural identities, and these intercultural identities are not based on consensus, but on mutual respect, on that mutual respect of empathizing with the other, of putting themselves in the shoes of the other, in order to have that feeling of belonging.
And that sense of belonging is what I've been feeling before you as I was telling you all this, and for this I'm very grateful to you.
(Applause)
What comes to mind when you hear the words PTSD?
Maybe words like war, violence or army.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing life-threatening events, such as war, accidents, assaults, or natural disasters.
Symptoms may include: nightmares, flashbacks, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, avoiding things and places, and negative thoughts What comes to mind when I ask you, what is mental health?
Maybe you're thinking about: Depressed... me?
I don't have that!
Hospital, or how does our mind work?
During the summer of 2016, I traveled alone to Amsterdam, before studying in Salamanca, Spain.
I visited Anne Frank's house.
As I walked through the halls and floors, I looked at the pictures and stories.
At one point I just stood there... And I cried.
I was moved by what I saw and read.
No one thought this was strange, nor did he speak to me when he saw me cry.
In this space, I felt like I could do it, and I stayed there as long as I could.
No one knew that my reason for entering this place was to find a place to cry, where no one would ask me why.
No one knew, at the time, that I was crying because I had been sexually assaulted.
This feeling of fear, shame, led me to remain silent, to find comfort in a place where crying seemed fine.
I returned home wanting to erase this memory forever, but everything changed quickly.
I began to experience panic attacks, often originating images places and news, which reminded me of the assault.
I felt guilty and ashamed, I felt empty and alone.
And even though I saw myself as someone who had everything under control, deep inside, I was falling apart.
Don't tell, they're going to think you're crazy!
Why did you walk alone?
Why did you travel alone?
But why did you put yourself in this situation?
How are you today?
This.
This helped me decide to seek help.
When I started having suicidal thoughts, my best friend told me that help was available, and connected me to health and psychological services at the university.
When I had panic attacks, I had friends who were just a message or call away.
They didn't have to say anything, they just listened.
The support, the acceptance, and having someone around, allowed me to seek that help.
Over time, I got the help I needed and was able to recover from PTSD.
According to the World Health Organization, about 800,000 people die by suicide each year.
In 2016 there were 3569 suicides in Spain, according to the National Institute of Statistics.
Almost ten people a day, one every two and a half hours.
Suicide is preventable and while we are not all experts, psychologists or psychiatrists, we all have the power to make a difference in someone's life, and play a critical role in creating change.
It can be as simple as listening.
Yes, it is important to risk speaking out loud for those who have lived or are living through trauma.
But, if my friend had not risked asking me how I was, maybe I would never have spoken.
I challenge you to break the barrier between those who are struggling and those who are not, because no one has to feel ashamed of not being well.
Each of us has to take a risk and reach out, and ask, How are you today?
Thank you.
(Applause)
How nice to be here.
(Applause) (End of applause) I've always wondered where the rhythm is.
Will it be in the ear?
Will it be in what I hear?
Or is it in what I see?
And then, talking on the phone with me, I realize... How?
That in what I see.
All around me there are so many rhythms.
And if I were deaf, wouldn't I be able to move?
Of course, Mary!
Because the rhythm is out in what you see.
And it's inside your body.
I'm dropping something.
Yes, the pants.
I have been given so many wires to talk to you.
(Laughter) But they forgot that I have pants.
(Applause) Yes, I do.
I want to tell you that there is nothing like a smile.
When someone comes up to me and says, "I want to dance."
Of course.
You can dance now.
With what?
With what you have.
Alas!
I see a mirror in my hand.
Ah!
The mirror says yes... Can.
And what is time?
The time is in doing and giving.
What I have inside is useless if I have no possibility of giving to the other.
So that in turn it finds ways and movement.
Mary, and the rhythm?
It's inside you.
When you breathe; (Exhalation) you already have rhythm inside.
When you see, the rhythm is outside.
I'm full of little colored lights that speak to me, they are stars.
Stars that illuminate, illuminate this afternoon.
No, Mary, it's the day.
No, it seems like night.
Because the stars shine when it's night.
And what is the day?
Having stars in our hands that look at us and speak to us.
Can this happen?
Of course!
Because it's inside you.
It's inside every look.
In every move we make is the rhythm you have created.
The rhythm is outside your body, but how beautiful what I have on the ground.
It's a circle.
How wonderful.
It has no doors.
The circle has no doors.
I don't know where to go out.
But how am I up here?
They have brought me.
You have brought me here to come to you.
And tell them you can.
Don't be afraid.
If I can't do this, I can do another one.
If I can't do another, I can do the other one.
I am the other.
I'm here to give you what you don't say you have.
What do you have?
Life.
What is life?
That's what I don't know.
That's what I want to find.
That's what I want to look for.
And only movement will help me.
So I ask you, if the word is movement and in my body there is the rhythm that I don't hear, you know?
I am deaf.
I don't know what the sound of the word is.
But I know, deaf as I am, I can feel the infinite rhythm that moves my body.
And I like to dance, you know?
I've always wanted to dance.
Because I always see the movement.
The movement, do you know when it starts?
When I open my eyes to the morning and say, "How beautiful the day that is waiting for me!"
Today is my day.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She just received a letter document.
She assumes that she is being asked to pay or leave and thinks about the boys, thinks about her work, thinks about the partner who abandoned her; He opens it and reads it.
He doesn't understand, he can't understand.
They are asking him to leave now, to leave now, the boys are not there, things are scattered.
Today I would have nowhere to go to sleep.
If I had a translator on the phone, without losing any information, I could read this.
[Pay within 48 hours, if you will not be sued.]
And she would stay calm, and maybe go to the Access to Justice Center where they would tell her that she has time and that they are going to help her.
But there is no translator from the lawyer language to a language that we all understand.
Google says it's too expensive for the few of us who are the community we are entitled to.
The letter is not understood but sends two messages.
The first is "I put a lawyer."
The conflict escalated and now we cannot solve it by chatting.
The second is darker.
The second says, "You.
it is outside the language of the law."
The language belongs to lawyers, judges, but not to you.
As it is going to have to be fixed in some way, we all know that many times in Argentina, "some way" is outside the law.
So that this does not happen, I am part of the Argentine Network of Clear Language, where we try to bring the language of the law to everyday language.
After all, the law in democracy is ours.
(Applause)
Today, in this place, we are approximately 5000 women.
1250 of us suffered or will suffer at some point in their lives a sexual assault.
1 in 4.
Only 10% will make the complaint.
The remaining 90% take refuge in silence.
One half, because the event occurs in the very bosom of the family or with someone known and that makes it much more difficult to live and tell.
The other half doesn't speak because they're afraid they won't be believed.
And they're right, because we don't believe them.
Today I want to tell you why I think we don't believe them.
We do not believe them because when a woman tells what happened to her, she says things that we do not imagine, that disturb us, that we do not expect to hear, that amaze us.
We look forward to hearing stories like this.
"Young woman raped on the tracks of the Mitre Railway.
It happened at midnight when he was returning home.
The young woman said that a subject assaulted her from behind, told her not to scream, that she had a gun, to stay still.
He raped her and then fled."
When we hear or read such a story, we are immediately represented with an image: the rapist, a depraved lower class; The victim, a young, attractive woman.
The image does not last more than 10 or 20 seconds and is dark, it is flat; There are no movements, no sounds, it is as if there are no people.
But when a woman tells what happened to her, her story doesn't fit in 10 or 20 seconds.
The following is the testimony of a woman we are going to call Ana.
One of the 85 women I interviewed in the course of an investigation I did on rape.
Says Ana: "We had gone with the girls from the office to the same pub we always go.
We met some kids and I got hooked on a skinny re piola.
We talked a lot.
At about 4 o'clock I told my friends to leave; They wanted to stay.
Then, the skinny guy asked me where I lived and told me that if it seemed okay, he would approach me.
I accepted and we left.
At a traffic light he told me he liked me and touched my leg.
I don't like a guy to advance like that, but I'd been loving all night.
I thought, "I can't be that paranoid, out there I tell him something and the guy nothing to see and I offend him."
When he had to bend, he went on.
I thought he had made a mistake and said, 'You passed!
', but something ugly I felt.
Now I think, why didn't I pay attention to what I felt?
When he stopped the car near the highway, I was afraid there.
But he told me to stay calm, that he liked me, that nothing was going to happen if I didn't want to; He spoke well to me.
I didn't say anything to him because I was afraid he would get angry and everything would get worse.
I thought I could have a gun in the glove compartment.
Suddenly he threw himself on me and wanted to kiss me.
I said, 'No!
'; I wanted to push him, but he had his arms in me.
When I let go I tried to open the door, but it was stuck.
Anyway, if he got out of the car, where did he go?
I told him he wasn't the kind of guy who needs to do that to be with a mine; that I liked him too, but not that way.
I tried to calm him down, I told him nice things about him.
I talked to him as if I were his older sister.
Suddenly, he covered my mouth with one hand and with the other he unfastened his belt.
At that moment I thought he could kill me, hang me, you know?
I never felt so alone, as if kidnapped.
I asked him to finish quickly and take me home."
What happened to you listening to this story?
Surely, several questions came to them.
For example, why didn't he roll down the window and call for help?
Why didn't he get out of the car when he sensed that something ugly might happen?
How could she ask him to take her home?
Now, when we are not facing a news story in the media, in front of a story that someone like me tells you from a scenario like this; When we are in front of someone we know and who chose us to trust us with his story, what happened to him, we are going to have to listen to him.
And we're going to hear things that we're not going to be able to understand or accept.
Then we will have doubts, questions, suspicions, and that will make us feel very bad; Guilty.
So to defend ourselves from that discomfort, we have a recourse.
We turned up the volume on all those things in history that we expected to hear: the gun in the glove compartment, the locked doors, the isolation of the place.
And we turn down the volume on all those things we didn't expect to hear and don't want to hear: like when she tells him she liked him too, or when she tells us that she talked to her like she was the older sister, or that she asked him to take her home.
What is the point of doing this?
To believe him, to be able to trust that she really was a victim.
I call this victimization of victims.
Victimization because in order to believe that they are innocent and that they are a victim, we need to think of them as defenseless, paralyzed, mute.
But there is another way to get rid of the discomfort, and that is exactly the opposite: we turn up the volume on the things we did not expect to hear, such as: "I spoke well to him", "I asked him to take me home", "I asked him to finish quickly", and we lower it to the things we did expect to hear, the revolver in the glove compartment,  Isolation.
What is this for?
It serves so that we can hold on to doubts, and feel more comfortable with doubts.
Then new questions appear, for example: Who sends her to go to those clubs?
Did you see how she dresses and the friends, the minis, the necklines?
What are you waiting for?
Questions that are certainly not questions, are rather judgments and judgments that end in a sentence: She sought it out.
The sentence would be corroborated by the fact that she later does not tell that she fought to avoid rape.
So it means that he did not resist, he means that he consented.
If she was sought out and consented, what rape are you talking about?
I call this victim-blaming.
Both the arguments that serve to blame and to victimize, we all have them, all in our heads, very close at hand, including victims and perpetrators.
So much so that when Ana came to me, she told me that she didn't know if her testimony was going to help me, because she wasn't sure that what had happened to her had been rape.
Ana, like most of us, also believed that a rape is more like an armed robbery, a violent procedure that lasts 4 or 5 minutes, and not the chamuyo of a nice young man that lasts a whole night and ends in a kidnapping.
When she was afraid of being killed, she was afraid that marks would be left on her, and she had to hand over her body to avoid it, that's when she learned that rape was something else.
Ana had never talked about this with anyone.
He could have turned to the family, but he didn't.
He didn't do it because he was afraid.
She was afraid that the same thing would happen to the person she had chosen to tell him, which is that doubts and suspicions arise, those questions, every time a topic like this is discussed.
And if that had happened, it would have been perhaps worse than the rape itself.
She could have talked to a friend, to a sister, very hardly to the couple: the slightest hint of doubt on her face or in her voice would have been devastating for her, and probably the end of the relationship.
Ana remains silent because she knows intimately that no one, not all of us, not her family, not the therapists, much less the police or the magistrates, are willing to listen to what Ana did at that moment.
First and foremost, Anne said "no."
When he saw that his was not useless, he spoke well to him, tried not to exacerbate his violence, not to give him ideas.
He spoke to her as if everything that was happening at that moment was normal, so as not to awaken in him the fear that she could later denounce him.
Now, I ask myself and ask them: is all that she did not resist?
No, it is not for all or almost all of us, probably, because it is not for the law.
In most countries, the codes still require that the victim, to prove her innocence, I mean well, the victim to prove her innocence, present marks on the body attesting that she had a "tenacious and constant" struggle with her aggressor.
I can assure you that in most court cases, there are no marks that reach.
I listened to many women.
And I heard no one speak of herself as if she had been reduced to one thing, totally subject to the will of the other.
Rather, I heard them as astonished and even a little proud to recognize how lucid they had been at that moment, how attentive to every detail, as if that allowed them to have some control over what was happening.
So I thought, "Sure, what women do in these situations is negotiate."
They negotiate sex for life.
They ask the aggressor to finish quickly, so that everything ends as soon as possible and at the lowest cost.
They undergo penetration, because although they may not believe it, penetration is what keeps them furthest from a sexual or affective scene.
They undergo penetration, because penetration hurts less than kisses, caresses, soft words.
Now, if we are going to continue to expect rapes to be what they very rarely are: a rapist who is a depraved lower class, and not a young university student or a businessman who leaves Levante on a Friday or a Saturday; If we are going to continue to expect the victims to be modest, demure women who faint at the scene, and not confident women, we will still not be able to listen.
Women will still not be able to speak, and we will all continue to be responsible for that silence and their loneliness.
(Applause)
You can imagine: you're in a bar and, you know, or in a disco, all that, and you start talking to a girl, and after a while, well, it comes up in the conversation "and what do you work on?"
And because you think your work is interesting, you say, "I'm a mathematician."
(Laughter) 33.51% of girls (Laughter) at that moment simulate an urgent phone call and leave.
(Laughter) 64.69% of girls desperately try to change the subject and leave.
(Laughter) There are 0.8% who are your cousin, your girlfriend and your mother, (Laughs) who know you work on something weird but they didn't remember what (laughs) and there is a 1% who follow the conversation.
When that conversation continues, invariably at some point one of these 2 sentences appears: A) "I was fatal with mathematics, but it was not my fault, it is that the teacher was horrible."
(Laughter) And B) "But what is the use of mathematics?"
(Laughter) I shall deal with Case B.
(Laughter) When someone asks you what math is for, they're not asking you about applications of the mathematical sciences.
He's asking you, "And why did I have to study that shit I never used again?"
(Laughter) That's what he's really asking you.
Given this, when a mathematician is asked what mathematics is for, mathematicians divide into groups.
54.51% of mathematicians take a posture on the attack, and 44.77% of mathematicians take a defensive posture.
There is 0.8%, rare, including myself.
What are the ones in the attack?
Those in the attack are mathematicians who tell you that this question does not make sense, because mathematics has its own meaning in itself, it is a beautiful building that has its own logic that is built and that one does not need to be always looking at the possible applications.
What is poetry for?
What is love for?
What is the use of life itself?
What question is that?
(Laughter) Hardy, for example, is an exponent of this attack.
And those who are defensive tell you that even if you don't realize it, honey, math is behind everything.
(Laughter) These always name, always, name bridges and computers.
If you don't know math, you drop the bridge.
(Laughter) Computers are really all math.
Now these have also given them to tell you that behind computer security and credit cards are prime numbers.
These are the answers that your math teacher will give you if you ask him.
He is one of those on the defensive.
Okay, but who's right?
Those who say that mathematics does not have to serve any purpose, or those who say that it is really behind everything?
They are really both right.
But I told you that I was one of that weird 0.8% that says something else, right?
So, okay, ask me what mathematics is for.
(The audience asks) Okay!
76.34% of people have asked, there are 23.41% who have kept quiet, and 0.8% that I do not know what those are doing.
Well, dear 76.31%, mathematics is true that it does not have to serve for anything, it is true that it is a beautiful building, a logical building, probably one of the greatest collective efforts that the human being has made throughout history.
But it is also true that wherever scientists, where technicians, are looking for mathematical theories, models that allow them to advance, there they are, in the edifice of mathematics, which permeates everything.
It is true that we have to go a little deeper, let's see what is behind science.
Science works by intuition, by creativity, and mathematics tames intuition and tames creativity.
Almost everyone who has not heard it before is surprised that if one took a sheet of paper 0.1 mm thick, those we normally use, large enough, and could fold it 50 times, the thickness of that pile would occupy the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
Your intuition tells you, "That's impossible."
Do the math and you'll see that it does.
That's what mathematics is for.
It is true that science, all science, only makes sense because it makes us better understand the beautiful world we are in.
And because it makes us, it helps us to avoid the trappings of the painful world in which we are.
There are sciences that touch that application with the hand.
Cancer science, for example.
And there are others who look at it from afar, with envy at times, but knowing that we are its support.
All the basic sciences are the support of those, and among them mathematics.
All that makes science science is the rigor of mathematics.
And that rigor comes to them because their results are eternal.
Surely you have said, or have ever been told, that a diamond is forever, right?
It depends on what one understands forever!
A theorem, that's forever!
(Laughter) The Pythagorean theorem, that is true even if Pythagoras has died, I tell you.
(Laughter) Even if the world sinks, the Pythagorean theorem would still be true.
Wherever a couple of legs and a good hypotenuse come together (Laughter) the Pythagorean theorem works at the top, at the top.
(Applause) Well, mathematicians are dedicated to making theorems.
Eternal truths.
But it is not always so easy to know what is an eternal truth, a theorem, and what is a mere conjecture.
A demonstration is needed.
For example: imagine that I have a large, huge, infinite field here.
I want to cover it with equal pieces, without leaving gaps.
I could use squares, right?
You could use triangles.
Circles no, which leave gaps.
What is the best piece I can use?
The one that to cover the same surface has a smaller edge.
Pappus of Alexandria, in the year 300 said that it was best to use hexagons, as bees do.
But he didn't prove it!
The uncle said "hexagons, uh, peta, come, hexagons, give it to me!"
He didn't prove it, he stayed in a guess, said "Hexagons!"
The world, as you know, was divided between Pappists and anti-Pappists, until 1700 years later, 1700 years later, in 1999 Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right, that it is best to use hexagons.
And that became a theorem, the honeycomb theorem, which is going to be true forever, always ever, more than any diamond you have.
(Laughter) But what if we go to 3 dimensions?
If I want to fill the space, with equal pieces, without leaving gaps, I can use cubes, right?
Spheres no, which leave holes.
(Laughter) What's the best piece I can use?
Lord Kelvin, the one of the Kelvin degrees and all that, that said that the best thing was to use a truncated octahedron (Laughs) that as you all know (Laughs) It's this from here!
(Applause) Let's go!
Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home?
(Laughter) Even if it's plastic.
Nene, brings the truncated octahedron, that visitors come.
Everyone has!
(Laughter) But Kelvin didn't prove it.
It remained in a conjecture, Kelvin's conjecture.
The world as you know, was divided between Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists (Laughter) until a hundred and something years later, a hundred and something years later, someone found a better structure.
Weaire and Phelan, Weaire and Phelan found this little thing from here, (laughter) this structure that they put the imaginative structure name of Weaire and Phelan.
(Laughter) It seems a rare thing but it is not so rare, it is also present in nature.
It is very very curious that this structure, due to its geometric properties, was used to build the swimming building at the Beijing Olympic Games.
There Michael Phelps won 8 gold medals, became the best swimmer of all time.
Well, of all time until a better one comes out, right?
As it happens to the structure of Weaire and Phelan, it is the best until a better one comes out.
But be careful, because this one does have the opportunity, that even if a hundred and something years pass, even within 1700 years, someone shows that this is the best possible piece.
And then it will be a theorem, a truth forever, always ever.
More than any diamond.
So, well, if you want to tell someone that you love them forever (Laughs) you can give them a diamond, but if you want to tell them that you love them forever, always, give them a theorem!
(Laughter) Of course, quiet, you will have to prove it, that your love does not remain in conjecture.
(Applause) Thank you.
We are each in a way in this life.
Some of us are more extroverted, others more introverted and others, neither one thing nor the other.
I, I have to say, am very introverted.
I'm not good at social relationships.
Imagine how difficult it is for me to put myself in this red dot in front of so many people.
It is much more interesting for me to stay on a quiet Saturday with a friend or two, than to get into the hustle and bustle of a crowded nightclub.
And I tell you no more, to stay at home, quiet, in the warmth, watching a movie.
Oh, the movies!
There is nothing in this world that I like more.
Cinema has been my biggest passion in the last 5 or 6 years.
In this time, I have developed a taste for cinema that goes beyond the meaning of the word "entertainment".
And why cinema?
What is it about cinema that makes me like it so much?
If I tell you the truth, until recently I had not asked myself that question.
I've already said I'm not good at interacting with people, but I'm very good at watching.
I love to observe.
I really enjoy watching people talk, interact with each other, walk, without being a gossip.
Don't think wrong.
But that's why I think I like cinema so much.
In the cinema, in the movies, you don't enter, you just deign to observe them from the outside.
Cinema gives you a broad, total vision of the world, of all its people, of all its ideas, of all its ways of seeing reality.
And I think that's why I like cinema so much.
In all this time, I've seen thousands of those visions and I think I have a much more global idea of the world than if I had never watched, or seen movies.
I think that's the great advantage of being behind, of not interacting.
And what kind of cinema do I like?
I admit, it's not that it's the most typical cinema of people my age.
It is an auteur cinema, independent cinema, low budget, social denunciation, far from the archetypes of US cinema, cinema of countries as rare cinematically as Turkey, Palestine or the Philippines.
Well, my mother says I'm very weird, but it's the kind of cinema I like the most, the one I enjoy the most, with its characters and stories.
They touch your heart.
You feel things with them, you suffer with them, you cry with them, you laugh with them.
As one of my favorite directors, Lars von Trier, says, "Movies are like stones in shoes, they have to hurt."
It's not that we have to suffer with each and every movie, but we have to feel real emotions.
However, when I watch movies from the US, full of special effects, empty characters, stories that contribute nothing, it's just a story, nothing more.
It doesn't come to you, you don't feel, you don't suffer, you don't cry.
That, to me, is useless.
I, being an introvert, carried my love of cinema as my own, something personal.
Everyone knew he was a cinephile but he had virtually no one to discuss the movies he watched with.
All this changed one day when, ironically, I leave the cinema and receive a private message from Twitter: "Hello, we are looking for a boy or girl in Valladolid to cover this edition of Seminci.
Would you sign up?"
And what was I going to say 7 days after the best auteur cinema in Europe and on top of it free?
Well: "Of course.
Count on me."
And here you had me, with 15 years and a journalist's accreditation hanging around my neck.
That week I was watching movies, movies and movies.
I got into the journalistic world a bit, but what I got out of there was much more than that.
I finally found a way to channel my feelings towards cinema, to express myself, to open my inner world to others.
Every day I had to write a chronicle with the movies I saw, what I liked about them, what I had disliked.
And I don't know if it may seem easy or difficult, but it's very complicated, because a film has many elements: the script, the direction, the actors, the music, the sound.
And what is right about each of them?
Do they make the movie good or bad?
At first, this was very complicated.
I always forgot things in the chronicle.
But in the end, with practice, it almost comes out fluid.
When the 58 ended. edition of the Seminci, I began to collaborate regularly with the website that had accredited me, which is called Esencia Cine.
In this time, almost a year, my ability to write, to express myself, and my enormous love for cinema have been increasing and increasing by leaps and bounds.
That was last year.
What has happened this year?
That I hung up the accreditation again and got back to work on the 59th. edition of Seminci.
I assure you that this year I learned a lot more because I saw more films, practically 20 in 7 days, I went to many more press conferences and I had a meeting with Imanol Arias.
The result was a week of cinema, cinema and more cinema, in which I learned a lot.
And I assure you that this will always remain, even if I did not study, even if I did not eat practically even if I did not sleep, I learned and it will stay for me forever.
Many people, when I tell them that I write for a website, that I write for Seminci, almost all of them say to me: "Do you get paid?"
Well...
Not really.
Why am I getting paid?
Why are they going to pay me when I do what I really like, what I really feel and on top of that it helps me to open up to others?
At this age I am, I wouldn't find anyone to pay me to do this.
I don't have the race, I don't have anything.
But, really, in this life, if you want to do something, do it.
If you get paid, great.
If not, you will be happy with your work, which I think is the most important thing.
No?
(Applause) Cinema has opened many more doors for me than I thought.
Because I write about cinema, I manage to open up, I can really be me.
When I write, I break the barrier I have of oral expression, which costs me so much.
I get to really be me, to express my ideas as I feel them.
But far from all this, which serves me a lot and what I am proud of, I think that what I like the most, what I enjoy most with my work, is when I write something, a news, criticism or report, I hang it up and receive messages from colleagues, friends, family, teachers who say: "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love it."
You know that when you do that, your work, apart from coming in handy for you, is good for others because they enjoy and learn from what you do.
And when they tell you that you know it's great.
(Applause) And here you see me, a quiet, shy, introverted boy, who with 15 years and without any faith in himself, managed to do the same job as some journalists with his work, his degree, his salary and his best skills of expression in public.
The way I've found to open up I wouldn't change it for anything.
I am me when I write, it is me.
And I'm going to tell you something, don't trust what you see of me every day, what you see in photos and videos.
Do not trust.
Trust what I write, because there I am, really me.
Without any cover, without any barrier.
But, far from all this, that "Congratulations.
You write great.
I love what you do," is the best they can tell me.
It's the nicest thing you can tell me in life, being an introvert.
Thanks a lot.
(Applause)
