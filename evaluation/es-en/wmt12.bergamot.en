Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia for Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet final, the appeals court is required to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which convicted the former prime minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for their approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who the winner is.
As usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of clarifying whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, Shariah, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will have their hand cut off.
Women can now forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will join in the Koran.
An order will be established in Libya that we cannot and cannot be imagined and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably not in the best way, on the other hand, it was not in the best interest of the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is no surprise that Islamic fighters accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but greater, is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful interventions.
When they seek victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught up in a shootout that Islamists and our politicians are used to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But without occupation, will the oil companies get hold of Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may finally be that the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the Sharia fans don't cross us.
A new era of the crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investor hunt
A whirlwind statistic has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the four-year period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical cabinets of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent, France's 0.4 per cent
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew year-on-year by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the four-month period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the "S" the trend of gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is formed.
The results are even worse than analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, but four months has stalled.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen year-on-year to 5.2%.
The interest on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on 10-year Czech bonds remains at 4 per cent, although in the area the situation is worsening.
Voices are raised in Germany that say the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro Cup.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season.
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Eech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European Championship event.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Eech and the heroic Jiráek, beat 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very tight Czech defence, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the party were Damjanovic and Vu-ini, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Eech, the eleven Czech will not miss the European Cup event, so the coffers of national football will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Already from the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were determined only to maintain the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking to the other field in defence, just what the Czech defence knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die from their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they would like to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed Tuesday at noon to the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology centre working with uranium on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is eager to obtain nuclear weapons.
Israel speaks of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facility and then threw death slogans at the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse Iran's nuclear programme, according to Israeli sources, would be achieved not only by the Isfahan plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched, would be achieved.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and sausage dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children come mostly from families with a non-healthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of obese people had had chips dined the day before the test, which is linked to the "obesity is not a coincidence" prevention program.
In the families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and almost 900 children from Basic Education from all over the world participated in the same period.
It was already the second edition of the "Obesity of No Chance" program, supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and a lot of family exercise are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the survey's results.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst part was to discover that 10 per cent of households don't eat breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, the insane chips are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink sweet soft drinks (70%) daily.
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed play sports, however, among their parents this result is less than half, only 15 per cent.
Fasting your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming," the study's final report warns.
As a main meal, the pasta takes the palm and follows the bird meat closely.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "obesity is not a coincidence," there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the study results note.
Attention, for example, is what sugars are about sweet soft drinks, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire bird meat and fish for the main food and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In the introductory article, How the Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures from three professionals in the bouquet, how to dress problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is a little cusket, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks about how to highlight the women's body of Jennifer Lopez's kind, huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in too challenging a way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers don't adapt, it's worth sewing at least one piece of extra bespoke fabric.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes that feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a tailored skirt you'll feel much better than with one you don't stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly a lot of different kinds of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and the other for the night.
You have to take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's been my turn to Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to cut them from the magazines or look for them on the internet and print them, and then graphically elaborate them.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think of the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only see physically, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was spoken by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is left by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged Saturday's conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment of dressing in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the vabarite (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it's enough to snap to scratch it and raise your neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out then that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not talking about the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn's assured us that the image and style are made up only, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks for our services, you have to keep in mind that they are very likely to tell us a very different size than their real (minor).
Then there's only left to gloat and find out if the heart magazines have already written about it, whether a certain celebrity has gotten fattened/thin, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand from outfit.
During his work, above all he must communicate with the people he or she dresses, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss it, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort the locker room and complete it with nice garments, you can't fuck and throw everything there was and say, "It's so charms.""
"Find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend so someone can wear them," Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka," that is, the job bag.
It is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, peelings, or unmissable. There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clumps of garments ahead, if it were larger (the pins and other hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cook the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more external.
And we did nothing but dress and cloth.
We couldn't touch the scissors with the scissors so we wouldn't damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservation.
I'm not really good at those skills.
This is just a small part of all we've heard all over the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that dedicating myself to professional styling is not a pink path, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes across America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in reality, nothing was intended to be done extraordinary.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again.
We are also curious to know what the scenes would look like, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be taken for granted, but in the total computation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality they cannot be called errors, but rather it is about the incomprehensible rest of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you don't even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
So it's nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the fall landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, racing is diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury you an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, try to overtake a number of required rivals (normal in a classic race), then try to buy time (classic timed) and then expect a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, who only make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are plenty of fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but you can't say it's bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can search elsewhere.
But a race conceived with quite an action is good for this driving style, although we can find something better between the competition games.
So far, everything in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Of such games you can't expect him to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow to any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so it's not all in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or you get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, neither the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civilian" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It's the same when you get there, because it's programmed that the "surprise" will always happen under your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, without taking into account the moment, the same opponent will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you are, whatever price.
When he goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car ackle.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you are probably disappointed right away.
And it's a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the credit is taken up the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that boredom doesn't fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline dispensers next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will suffice what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in concrete places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the upper level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog feature, which compares your results with those of other players and develops other community functions.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you arrive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly the subway convoy comes from behind you and you are just ahead.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the game's programming none thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a buzz of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
It is too bad that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents involving many participants, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of tastes.
In order for most of the youth group to be liking, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not done.
The fun is assured, but prepare because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Viceová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativist and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war to be waged without a barracks".
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," so the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began with conviction, her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe," which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe every body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers at the Faculty of Law of the U.S. - Carolina.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing comes the criticisms, that if he is insane, a grey official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
'He's a man who knows how to listen to members of the 27 states, communicate with them and who has a very clear view of where the EU should go.'
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call her?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union in the face of States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us Olomouc's cheese.
Vicenová has also addressed the agenda, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the ambassador's words, "a good fuss," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and what least? That's something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly."
'The truth is I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the strangers or the jargons that people don't understand.'
"How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one will ban us Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive rather the negative aspects than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak man comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, "What, have you left, those in the Visegrad Group?" and it can be seen that it doesn't make it any fun of it."
In the future, according to Vicenová, the EU is awaiting tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries we want and those that do not stay out of cooperate."
"These procedures will be more and more and will reinforce the two-speed Europe," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed between the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM's strategy very accurately, the closest would be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was placed by the firm's first chief, the visionary Thomas J. Watson, sir.
Already he coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think" became his label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised enterprise culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century," said the current director of the company Samuel J. during his anniversary. Palmyra.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, worried about the care of his employees as the businessman from Baa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were one of the first American operators to enjoy paid, safe holidays, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (because it was one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, which will replace Palmisano next year with a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marquetin and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of online ideas, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
Not surprisingly, they are overwhelming, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained an institution concept rather than tech company," says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between getting into the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the world's largest companies.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (developed both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," Samuel J acknowledged. Palmyra.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are from programmes and a fifth are from the programme and another fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier quota.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets worth $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first manifested.
IBM acts on the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the big economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that so far IBM has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company's net profit has continued to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
You can therefore hope that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM's story: from cheese cutter to spaceflight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "shopping clock," which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help you with the management of the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (Willion's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years running the company, turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's large expansion on the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost after 40 years occupying the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peaces," which set the standard of computers at the time, came to the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began offering complete advice and high value-added services.
The strategy IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM introduced not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM R also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Here too is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtáová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay on that donkey, I don't want anymore.
Darina Rychtáová (53) said that's it.
After her husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartoová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
But it will no longer wait and have set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Rychtá.ová.
When Darina Rychtáová welcomed Bartoové at home during the summer, he could not even imagine how his marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after "i'any" and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtá broke with Bartoová, his wife wouldn't wait at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live not as my dear old blur who was wrong, but as a man who joined certain ties," said Rychtáová, adding that she had already unhooked her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if he's locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible".
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I do the house arrangements, look after the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtá said.
If Rychtá, there was a new love, he would not object.
'We don't sleep together and she doesn't care, or where she goes or if she has any boyfriends.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took full responsibility," Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, each of them will generally name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize you in the following lines, where you cite certain female vices that manage to make men boil the blood?
Go shopping
Do you reproach your half orange that you have dependence on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag in the week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
So in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores, look for tight garments and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Isn't it?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you accuse your partner of stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have dirty a freshly cleaned sink and a glass cabinet that it took you so hard to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation," prove to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The worn underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those worn socks tomorrow" too.
"The wet rag isn't left on the floor".
If you make those comers your partner more times a day, know that you'll get him out of his boxes.
Naturally. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, wouldn't make that many comments.
Slanders and gossip
Some women also have slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about things about who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes gets away with a little harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is typical of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossip women of those who don't control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought the victory over the Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and puts the Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and took one more step and was declared a better player of the match.
Two attendances were awarded in the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorásek.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had told him before the game he would make a triplet."
"I felt it".
"Sometimes they look ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first plot of the Flyers.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trail.
Vorá-ek took the puck behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was ejected, but from the start of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' goal room.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely in the top three," Jágr told his center.
'It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.'
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from penalty, to get to a goal away.
Matt Read didn't allow any more complications, although they finished out in two-on-one.
"Pronger had a good performance on our field."
"He cleared the puck, I took speed and Read went to the farthest side."
"I tried to hit the album and I'm happy because I got it," Vorá-ek described the last goal of the game as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender, Jaroslav Es-paek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew due to an upper-body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also for a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Plekanec couldn't take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the missed points to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad".
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Anyway, but that's nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"Both rotating the players turned on us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to further simplify the game, get the puck off our field."
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Come on up.
The goalkeeper Ond-ej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: Eedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at the time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it could be traveled to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime then bowed to the west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at the time, but one had to queue with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still, it wasn't all won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people," who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way Czechs travel has suffered from a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the no longer to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that Croatia, until 1989 could not be traveled freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waiver was imposed to travel to Western European neighbouring states, prompting a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, weren't fed up with the tours to the West, everyone wanted to see him for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of Czechs at the time was to take with them food (conserves, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was also increasing and with it the average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 regularly to prepare for travel using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs already travel visaless to almost every developed country except the US, which further simplified our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to enormous demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights have departed every year with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries. This winter it will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country more developed among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3 per cent) and for the first time in their history, more than 15,000 Czech kronor per head, have spent on foreign trips, including expenses at the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up again in a stalemate.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Haek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAR) will not be known either after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to be held this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you won't even be able to vote to choose from the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindsich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomaá Paclík.
He's resigned from his post in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to take care of football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Haek era, a dispute broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní d'm), located in the Praguense neighborhood of Smícv, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and because of this only point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be thrown at the Executive Committee than, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The view on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the impasse?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Duan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAR, who, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win that candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage estimates, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and would completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With what has been said, surprisingly, Toma Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more in the interest of Pelta.
"I would like to see the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who is running for the first time as a candidate and directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk, the new president will be decided and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will be appeased with our national team's match today at the European Championship.
"Football will again be a protagonist, and this will cooperate more comfortably," says the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professional and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new General Assembly blockade."
"I hope common sense will be imposed anyway," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game begins if the football team will be complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one to take place at the ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parts into the country's most powerful sports organization so that an agreement can be reached.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (STV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomas Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAR), he would not run for such a relevant position.
"If there was a proper person, I would be fighting for it and not run for election."
"But to this day you have not been able to find a person like this," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (TK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAR).
Paclík also points out that, if he expires, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
'I've already spoken to some people I might take into account.'
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to most annoying Paclík right now is Pelta's relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association president Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobist with the ability to influence delegates' vote in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential seat.
"If he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less out of it," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
Should he win Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable".
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager".
"I don't stick my nose where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September drew much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrast Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits he would dare to manage the association.
He resorts to his management skills for private companies, as since last summer he has also been the Director of the Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K.etínsk.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If they were to raise gambling taxes, as political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FAR President should be "not a supporter."
Peltic is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see any sense in the fact of hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then come back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, disputes over electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, should he be elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels are dealing with football for a long time and expect to meet the new president this Thursday."
"They feel the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at the Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha'ek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were approved in the General Assembly in June."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president as early as September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principle, without which we can't exist," Pelta says.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his formation in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
Thomas Paclík had not been attacked for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with his head.
"He's been in the world of football for more than a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lower competitions to the higher.
The latter should be a promotional showcase for football.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians in the wake of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I would have to know each employee's tasks first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicted before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly succeed in overcoming it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA-R would start working eagerly.
If the fourth General Assembly was elected to current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
It also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work initiated by former President Ivan Ha'ek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, going through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the TK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competences of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then others would give up too."
"It's about having faith not to quit like that, just like that," he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Haek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work is over that I don't want it to be lost now."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I wouldn't like someone to stop them," he said, worried that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before the time of Haek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is all the people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few elected."
'I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in someone's favour.'
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that would only be bohemian to the president.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young black players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma Paclík, president of Club Pilsner, Rajchl, believes in his chances of being elected, joined the presidential election.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kronor from disadvantaged contracts, television contract negotiations and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"If he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Haek has already started and would not significantly change the staff on the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he assesses his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best wellbeing is in the water.
When Iris Meder made an investigative trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn't miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome high, swam towards the marble angels, who waited for her on the edge of the pool and amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the moment of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "strip through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathroom culture.
"It doesn't want to have anything to do with sport," Meder says, "just water is different."
It only bothers you that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the jolts of the birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools have to always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting pretty pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Spread in the pool and ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so large because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is folded optically: the high vaults, the colorful tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it wants to jump to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the copies highlighted in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bathroom in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as hot springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are found in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfárdá in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: As the whole city sets its eyes on Zurich's roofed pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary awaits customers in Langenfeld: The Cathedral of the water of Otztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of Otztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the bathrooms of Arpad in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legam sticks to the skin as you enter the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a spot in her quest for nice bathroom spots, when she wanted to visit uncovered pools and sunbaths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, found a blocked plot of land.
Architect Duan Jurkovic's 1902 bathroom was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow between the tiles.
The decline was in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after yes; not only can you discover neo-Romanic elements of the time of construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is native to the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently is not very important.
Agricultural species
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank renounce its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges push up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate's campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have unzipped from offers and demands, and take profits out of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deeps to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's directive, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting at rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks currently damage public welfare."
Ackermann is the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
" Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments in its portfolio where it puts the money for food price bets at stake," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people who go hungry or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the consortium boss wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank said the chairman of the board will change something different than what was not planned on the board.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation, it can perfect its image.
And he needs to barely care about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was participating in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
Forty-three percent would discourage a bank like this from their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflecting, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The ward transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and crumbled.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern post-gerra passion, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of thought about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 universal exhibition of Brussels is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Architecture Grand Prix for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is now considered a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the South Vienna station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was opened, it was called the "house 20."
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to hang art, or a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly falling.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, reached a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the renovations with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of the same name are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and also an office building be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he was extended and awarded the contest, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place," in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devour," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says, warning of rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Trussels" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the city's history."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why he wanted to "awaken the right conscience."
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of luck has happened. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood," with homes and offices, is next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city over a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against winter train breakdowns and delays, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan for the group, of planned investments up to 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For better availability of vehicles and the rail network, even with extreme time, must be achieved.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn President Rodiger Grube warned of breakdowns and delays on trains also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for a federal rail office authorization.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to test the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an shaft at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fines in the US
After the tumult over chairman Josef Ackerman, a new US problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial markets regulator NCUA criticises many large banks inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank does not admit any blame with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked other big banks for accounts and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to doom to many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a tricky wind is currently blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business at a volume of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses," without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, American big investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or information technology as long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the Information Technologies departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as an honor.
Therefore, the early Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett has unveiled on the CNBC economics station that it has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 per cent stake.
Buffett said IBM has so far known nothing about the commitment.
He praised the leadership that dealt with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M?nchener R.ck.
Buffett, 81, took over small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humbling.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible meaning to make money has provided him with the nickname "Omaha's oacle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock rose by one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is listed, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is realized
Following the discovery of "Zwickau's cell," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that rekindles it.
The murders of eight small trick and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin, there has been a fear and concern react to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost believed to have long been killed returns, since the fire-shaped attacks in Molln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence against the far right against Turks.
However, there has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The out-of-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, by far, predictable.
"Is bloody ideology rekindled?" headlines the Turkish newspaper's online edition "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, over the weekend remembering victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn ceremony on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was staged in joyful colors, like a story with happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," reads the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "H.rriyet" does not insist on drawing up this mental connection either.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of the column of Ahmet K.lahci.
He stressed that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made a significant contribution with their work to rebuilding Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not long searched for suspects in the circle of the far right.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on it is lost, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weaponry."
"This will be the best self-protection".
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," he writes "Selen."
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks of M.lln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group's sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the deficiency of German politics following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Molln.
After the fire-shaped attack in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of their taxes.
Current information from the Turkish media shows again how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country is since then.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich Lake scandal
Europe's riskiest bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was learned that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: chairman of the administrative board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly remarks about its future peers.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr.bel."
It became clear in September that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all of the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7bn euros.
Oswald Gr?bel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB administrative board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over as chair of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, professor of economics and advisor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
At once he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had excellent fame until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss goods manager, but also handsome, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressing.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the CEO, who until then was regarded as a cool and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To carry this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some looked with contempt until shortly before: a Singaporean and opaque Asian state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 on Switzerland's second-best paid administrative council, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misdeed investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, making it the co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to turn over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to having helped with tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through misguided speculation and in the administration of assets by helping tax fraud.
And just as it was again a little calmer, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it again, this wretched history of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7bn euros, before the bank realised something was wrong.
And it was apparently unveiled this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution emerged, with which Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, being the guardians of the world's largest assets: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Spr?ngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich doesn't fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry stores like Tiffanys among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprsgli confectionery.
For years, Swiss banks have resided here: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks such as Julius B.r.
He enters the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are clad in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "safety."
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Safety.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at one point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the chairman of a small Swiss private bank says.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hessig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS crash" in Spanish).
Politicians awarded up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
You talk to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to get the two different UBS precursor banks to complement each other: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the management of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," said bench expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make way from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly: The folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: to bring Goldman Sachs out of the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables," the ratings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the company advisers commissioned highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Avid growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgage loans and then sell them, maintaining certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the decline for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The stalls at UBS became projectile seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, he has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, end investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decline a lot, it's now clear.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Gr.bel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct UBS's business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to his state in the mid-1990s.
It abolishes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself today.
So far he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain unvigorated.
Industrial production held in the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a crisis caused by indebtedness at its source.
General relief on changes of government in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming back to the foreground, Janney Montgomery Scott's Mark Luschini said.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed down 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges from 12,027 to 12,170 points.

The Nasdaq index of the tech stock lost 0.8 percent and left the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index bids fare with a 1.2 percent drop to 5,985 points.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistical office.
What created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
From his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws overboard a decade of old principles and enters the American technology sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the quotation of the shares of the traditional consortium and makes it quoted against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.

Smart graces spread in cities
In many places the grajos are considered "problematic birds": these very many animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate about the crap and noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against "problematic birds" so far.
The grains no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on graying in Read, East Fry.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grajos from the field; chemical applications in agriculture do not visibly end traditional vital spaces.
The hunt, the growing building and the fall of trees that house them make it difficult for birds to live.
The grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Read.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass killing the district's grievous grippers leapt to the negative press headlines.
Critics have described hunting animals by bird traps and stick-blaming murder as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and shunning them in a normal way is achieved nothing," said Werner Klever, a city planner and landscaper at Reader.
Shooting with water to nests or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, Lahr's environment expert, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are diverted, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Chasing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Reader.
A combination of scaring away animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Informational banners instead of chain saws" Uta Maria J.rgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against the animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a beak in the face with aplomb."
He co-founded the Ascheberger's track of teaching on the grajos of Ascheberger, where signs report on the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
He also has his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grays not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bites, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists at Cambridge University checked in four graces how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape that the stone had to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning grays had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva on a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them with a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube on the pipe shooter.
Three of the four giggles got it on the first try.
Portugal in the 2012 Euro Cup thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 Euro Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the last tickets for the 2012 Euro Cup in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.

Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).

At the Dream Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from more than 30 yards to put himself in the lead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his scoring skills from afar and made it 2-0 from 25 yards.
The Bosnians, who didn't show off in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, Englishman City's leader, sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Then collegiate Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Bosnian plumti, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark kicked a controversial penalty after an action from Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nornberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own doorstep (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front lap, very right at the Cech goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper of world-renowned goalkeeper, FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his seat on the third-party bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the final of the Euro Cup.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-range chute, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim also couldn't send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let them score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first big chance.
From the very beginning, the Stono defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute he put it ahead.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and sucked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Pain of Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "begins with a long drama person of the kind that can cause one to fall soul to your feet.
Here are some acting tips: Gently start this page and turn it on your page mark.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novel narrative, and this drama will work as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the wartime experiences of 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives blink here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones add to the mix while others go out.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on their hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your kids, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Far of facts," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.
Explanations of their lives can be scary or poignant, but they are fuller of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and managing with what's in there.
As for telling the story of a German schoolgirl, she says: "Sugarishes, everywhere you substitutes."
"Caffe substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the suncaster food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peeling of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit on armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and tagged pecher."
Instead, a British soldier realizes he'll probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you'd like to think it could happen in front of the audience," he writes.
Instead, it's horribly similar "to a convicted man being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Mr Englund writes, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-coop clothing that executes his butcher while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both unholy and heroic behaviour.
Mr Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen by the trade in pus gonococ, which soldiers buy and embarrass their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often leads to a lifelong blindness."
In this translation of the Swede by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way war "disallowed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like Unnew on the front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he's come from his book, torn from your fingers that dramatis personae page, and burned it with a match.
After a false step before, a planned assault the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, initially telling others who were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence highlighting how the operation plagued itself with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying peppers on protesters, could not be repeated, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas."
And that's why the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking out on Zuccotti.
The officers stepped up the so-called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to get into Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to get into Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but they stopped when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who routinely flood neighborhoods with a high crime rate.
Mr Kelly said many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1am a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and loudspeakers congregated at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue winds, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No store was blown up until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists at the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said an attempt was made to prevent police from taking action at the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the west edge of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including luggage and paper garbage and plastic bags packed with clothes, equipment from the Cleaning Department followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, posting images on the internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area near the park's center.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp were clinched each other by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disruption of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer at the scene was Joseph J. The department chief, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
- Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective officer, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, "wasn't running the operations," Mr Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar streets in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of officers, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the latest weapon available to the union, in the 37th municipal district in its effort to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, the parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid, lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow the city to access a health care fund by working groups last spring to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a town hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member counter-attacked, saying nothing in the budget specified that the school's support staff members would be sacked.
City district officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A news conference will be held Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit, in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as do most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in poor-area schools in the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been chronically under-subsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Given the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The 36th district budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra funding for each student per poor student in schools.
The union also says high school principals may have been misled by language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessively" more often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a job exchange, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Six parent coordinators were fired," the draft complaint says, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, that veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi be captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democratic for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "bravery."
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's a statement of bipartisan support for your democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate over Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually simwear the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress was then overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee's resolution "congratizes the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "gives the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win full support from the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Place (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
A Lugar spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly every Republican congressman and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves an assembly-wide vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations between them.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and a handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially rookie Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the chance to boast that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of the amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (Democratic for New York) wants to take the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic for Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that they have been the members in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in 110o.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Hitted but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in a constituent event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic for Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway tune "The Sun will Come Out Tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News' "20/20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied: "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special hour-long "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Crazy and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the early weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to do simple actions.
A head movement.
A frumping of the lips.
And then his first word: "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "cough," a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who did two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to first ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Day, hard, hard".
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said: "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've only been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.'
Troops make them feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The tag crowd stood up and clapped.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as a kind of orphaned child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really. It was a pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and an American public often distant, at times adoring.
The troops are vorized with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if he is being punished by uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B said. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry, violent veteran below the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to hold on under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, of the American indifference to wars.
Battlefield achievements are rarely chosen for praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
Otherwise, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and was on his way back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a warning signal," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native brushed aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts".
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their comrades, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's biggest flat, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department's defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
For a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the women's soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, Burke says, too.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are on the move, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Defense Department's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are significantly underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military went to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times differently to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the living room."
"I was put in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That was not his trial. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed him with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dispensed from the service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his running mates continues, it's a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind it because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that poses responsibility.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them ... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go your way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will put his other hundred plaintiffs in the queue for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time he preceded his attack on his computer, chatting to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't that hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information cache is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then ran ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in "Like," messages on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a surge in research, driving the number of academic jobs with the site's name on the title to almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that college students who talked about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student posting too many status updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "puncturing" its own population to get data.
The site's Data Team has produced statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - long-standing digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its large amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, says of a 2006 study he conducted with Facebook's public walls of students.
"In what he was concerned about, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information on a user's profile and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper and pen are still the best investigative tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of the social still happens offline."
"Freheart and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in a packed room with 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked.
All attended with the aim of moving towards completion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
'It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.'
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill person, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with recently rediscovered Jobs that has been dusted as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the trade processes and workflows of products.
He was certainly a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser and a junkie of the flow charts - a man who believed many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 per cent of the job... [but] there's a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time it had been just 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The lost, 68-minute interview that hits Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster towards the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs assesses what other companies do well and wrong, and offers their own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, the long-awaited dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are: "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting into detail.
Baffled by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cube, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine commercial costs in detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Case" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and screaming through the pay-day phone and going back a minute later to the pay phone at the door next door," Jobs says with a chuckle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the US diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was woken to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and phone sale with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
'That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I'd seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated its employees.'
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, a customer asked if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working on only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went away and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs prophetically anticipated the way many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you do better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running companies and people in charge of products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rostruted because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... as the big idea evolves, changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do to do electrons, the glass makes them, the robots do, the factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, the great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computing, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were groomed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to carefully study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to accept the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic five-and-a-half-hour plea is expected by March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and pleads that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W administration. - Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among those aides were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon Code 4C, which reads: "A judge can attend fundraising events from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event. "
But Scalia and Thomas's absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This stunning gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who comply with the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were haunted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court."
His appearance and fundraising attendance for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say mix court activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the lower court.
His critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication he's going to do it.
Boeing receives record $18 billion order
Emirates airline is calling for 50 Boeing 777 dual-award aircraft, with an option at 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rare is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes amounts to a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place Boeing got the order from: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need $2,220 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft worth $US50 Boing 777 double aisle jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in Dubai's 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it's one of the biggest costs - isn't that damaging, because the country is making money from rising oil prices.
That's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger plane at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister, reportedly defeated in Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of their opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They took over the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have far outnumbered Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in the position of governor, came in third place, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
But violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed in recent days and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's current sovereign debt crisis has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and prompted calls for major emerging economies to join in helping the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's $1 billion, up to $800 million living on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that won't go well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downward risks" because of the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible cuts to defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial backlash from the Pentagon's corridors, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more reduction in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress' failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would result in 23 percent overall reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A such large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would ensure that most of our shipbuilding and construction projects cannot be implemented - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the willingness."
The cuts would eventually reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in grassroots budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"Places on payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime providers, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the potential impact of automatic cuts at the Defense Department.
"The consequence of a kidnapping at the Defense Department would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that you can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly candid about the possible cuts, even though she reached a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a bleak picture of what might lie ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, invite aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crisis, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed previously around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and a few only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous the deception and lies in daily life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "picked" with an open microphone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding offences related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton as he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends on traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deceit are we found?
On any given day, studies show you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you," the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lie have been refuted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush or restless.
It cannot be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detecting deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "targeted" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people less often lie to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies they often say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a baddoer, others will feel less guilty in lying to you.
How do you know if anyone is lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal feature.
You'd better know if someone normally hits the footy all the time so they don't make unfair accusations when they see their feet punching in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet at the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly or display a "post-interview relief" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions are over.
Questioners often falsely show that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the time spent while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distance language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... to what I know... to me.."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted after threat of US delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval for a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reinstate it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Capitol in Nebraska.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department's announcement last week that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are considered to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied the policy was wrapped up in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found the project only had limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada's hired lobby member Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when staged stageman Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said 'yes' and I went to get it,' he said.
LaBelle angry admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,"" Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in whatever you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - the C-word and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing the water from the bottle over me.'
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter,"" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle jumped on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and removed from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loudly she vomited, she added.
The family later sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
'That kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially when it targets a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms.'
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of administration of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled of change, which generated high expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is no deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost effects, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage to 52,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinister crops were those of vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year accelerated growth, since from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in the number of people.more than 74,000 unemployed Sinaloans, an increase from the first semester of 18,969.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, already for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Immigration arrested
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties in entering, and second because entering they already have many difficulties in finding work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5, 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7, 375 pesos.
Attraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of state FDI totaled 630,697 dollars, representing a fall of 87.74 percent from the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government counts a total investment of 17 280 million pesos in the year, which occurred mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July the state congress to approve a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was in the amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have to align everyone's efforts and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic contentment
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a sluggish economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has be detonated," he said.
Work to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the government's efforts.
"Overall I would say that the government has been striving to deliver good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress in the area but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He is convicted of 8kgs of marijuana
A neighbour of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office reported that the convicted narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the 80th post, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist was travelling in a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and a small backpack in the co-driver's seat, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains an intern in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contributions for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of municipal social development indicated that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled the contributions corresponding to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
"It is almost 12 million what they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a share," he said, "we have not delayed the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we to access these programs had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts to ensure that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in force.
The draft judgement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister said he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure through general rules measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that if it did so, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the leadership of the State.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership of the State, encompass a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the count "vote per vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Law on the Official State Newspaper, arguing that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the state president's vote on constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote," María de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM, it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in cases that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the record of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the box; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the poll boxes may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary computation it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the candidate second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially recounted will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
Your last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, on Monday, reconnaissance and a mass of requiem were carried out.
According to his relatives, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "he was barely in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."

They locate three abandoned bodies on Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot of grace on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding happened at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the fifth, whose fence is beige with coffee, was the open gate wide.
Looking inland, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow shirt with dark jeans, without footwear; next to him was another with a white strap shirt.
Within a metre was another individual's body with a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people were allegedly killed elsewhere, as no casings were found on the site.
In the fence of the fifth there are legends that are directed from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in it and the gate.
They capture 11 in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconing" and clandestine burials.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the verge of the economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with Italy's president to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain beacons confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to rush, market volatility put the yield on 10-year BTP Italian bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian boss Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocrat majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a further and devastating attack by financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are brought forward.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should be made up of technicians alone, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is higher than that of the tics
Of the 22 soccer players called in Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side only one of the 22 summoned reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranquin, count a wide record of class A interselling games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
That figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain intense activity in league and domestic championships a year, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
Added to this is the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The footballers, on the contrary, have a limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is by the archer Eker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly close to the century-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed all 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Elman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20th will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelic band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on The Nation on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican followers, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side over all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're very eager to play there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, they are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, then we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it makes it more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagine we'd be in a big rock band and having done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We're very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice ins Chain.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and is a rare thing.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them yet and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours keeps together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, on its own, is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be still alive and, second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have been growing, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure that we're not going too far on tour because it's easy to fall into that big crowd game and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we're still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There's so many.
Among the first to come up with me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite not being a fashion anymore?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of her, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
Why is this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-in boarded for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer in the tongue for which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows himself innocent.
He was operated on for cancer four times to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos that have been added to other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving in the National Special Operations Directorate of the police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propped for the exchange of information in all that are political issues between the two nations," as published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultation with its ambassador to the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax-exchange agreements in order to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of fiscal cooperation.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to wear glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Norndo's first video game originally designed for that support," since so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overtaken, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present the greatest difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "Aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not to succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting of that the moustache plumber will have to travel mined platforms of danger with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, the environments, the costumes and the enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he was due to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash up $70 million.
This ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that was demanding Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was due to the independence of the judiciary and executives, considering that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He said that during his term "he did not get his hands" in court decisions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did, is an executive process after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
Added to this is the 100 long number of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock at an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with dogradation problems or in a position to fall into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist Education Councillor Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current ecosocial councillor Ricard Gom.
The current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large room of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an occupyed farm where macro-partying was made
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday noon the property they illegally occupied, and where they organized macro-show parties that desperate the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the lock of the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition to her, as they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the nightclub they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints for noise, while, she pointed out, the inconvenience is not caused by the clients of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The nightclub manager explained that the discomfort was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "gives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city of the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week "immediately to dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the okupas had entered all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some of the there have even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be blunt against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police went to 35 Montral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the timing of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the midst of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some corridors of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In September, the city council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for two other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone pretends to put doors to the countryside.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to lay when two members of this former caste of elect recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "necessary" debate on "the mountain front," since the speech of Ildefons Cerdá, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can be started from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Frails of Collserola" encloses a "lexic trap": you don't have to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where we have to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Dangers derived from the "uncertain today it is to project public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and that it had in the area of the Forum "its swan song."
The first fear is the very delimitation of a border on where it can be built.
"Lying something is already setting the next step," that is, his overpass.
"We have to think about new urban, planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters."
Farther stuck to the question, Modol believes that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no," for a purely topographical issue.
M.dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not fall into a broken sack," although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the very beginning."
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he points out) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayonne insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal contests have been called," he says, "in the mountain-seat sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This causes, at least where appropriate, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him the pardon to the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic fee so that the Regiomontano city council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panista mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 in Patrimony crimes, he was transferred to the Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
He remained there for the 49 days following a second restraining order after the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office officer denied the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he only stayed a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was issued an arrest warrant by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the betting house.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal forgiveness and no claim may henceforth be filed regarding the process that followed; in addition, he will not be required to be compensated for harm or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the gambling house, at about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The clerk of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
He will also be notified of the court's immediate release order.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, lost his life and seven other people
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost his life, indicate that the helicopter hit the ground directly in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area does not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search they report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results possible before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter operated in cruise speed and that this happened in rising soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical standard, the flight was made under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at AICM located adequate conditions for take-off, as the aircraft progresses towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
Impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft wreckage in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft's wreckage suggests that the helicopter hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
Evidence remains undisclosed at the site of the disaster in the ship's remains of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the terrain.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it is predicted to be dismantled along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in an area wider than the cordoned site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, reinforcing the presumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security leads research to uncover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is leading research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the Siglo XXI National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by graduate specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population to participate either or not to be entitled to, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, he specified that the objective is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and inheriting history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics are applied to all participants (the aim is to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,' said the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows detecting whether they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark color folds (acantosis) in neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tam, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
At its conference A technological opinion of the bumps, given within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular weight, called asphalt, and others of low molecular weight, called malthens, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most shallow layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
As vehicles pass through and effort is generated, it allows forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were a modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, a final layer is placed called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, an arena that is also bathed on asphalt.
Since it's the layer that's going to be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction along the way.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the right thickness and the material of which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the terrain is moistened, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear is the film is the film and only then is the asphalt folder affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to prevent bumps from forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valley candidate lacked to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica E(1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
The valleyman replied:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me as a childhood is "The Prince," is a pretty deep book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Bury of Blood.""
An answer that he liked little first for the term "culturalizing" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she was calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise and what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, vote of the public for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, he stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on stage."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noticed that it lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for Channel RCN's "Como at Home" program said the fact that Melina was appointed princess "becomes that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest is not left as queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the latest elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle couldn't do it.
Her body was never her forte and here she was charged."
For this award, which for the first time is presented by the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in swimsuit arose a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the content that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins from today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top head of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano," through the cross-check of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the section of the CTI, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophosphorytry, which is the study of the friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against aliases Alfonso Cano to Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big expected.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that it was suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decadactilar card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top head of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
For a dactiloscopista de la Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false ballots or do not have papers.
We take the dataset print and search them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was his turn to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the footprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation found that a relative could be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, he does put him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint explained that in objects "prints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the TV show CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective cross-commady is done.
The "outraged" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part he served the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to Manhattan Square from where they were evicted in the early morning and trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "outraged" to camp again on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square again, we're going to settle somewhere else and we'll continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen for the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "outraged" response to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "outraged" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers beating the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or to ban protesters from accessing the park again with shops or other properties they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to hurt other people," since "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors fear "for their quality of life."
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
"Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," a lifeguard on "Baywatch," a bunny girl from "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then husband, the drummer of "M?tley Cr?e," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll depicting Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent of the devastating earthquake that occurred in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country has suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates put material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to move the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the upsurge in the purchase of machinery to restore areas ravaged by earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with a 0.9 per cent decline in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, pushed by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "fever values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and US forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed its weak results between July and September on the yen's quotation.
While markets continue their siege of the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
"We must be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the outlook is not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy has shown that the major powers are slowing down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area, even below the average, which is at level 100, with eight tenths rushing to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstated in the patches, Greece continues to entangle in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government comes more imposed by Brussels' demands than by a genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said at the opening yesterday of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear the doubts about her position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The Conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still echoed by the impact caused by the ordeal of Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek skewer still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a global high in the role of Microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the last two decades to raise this intrusion of cooperation, whose "essence" lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in which it aims to reduce by half the volume of people living on incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "threshold of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals."
Thus, Her Majesty explained that 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services will be 175 million at the end of 2015 and that 100 million of these households will leave the poverty line at which they are plunged.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition."
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "battle of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, as it is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered that microcredit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "breaks its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future had not initially been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy militants who believe the government's policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The several-minute standing ovation won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The Chancellor's key idea, and the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is no less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face."
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schuble.
Undoubtedly, the 27 are unlikely to reach agreement quickly on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country from the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany's weight.
Eager to calm the moods inside her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that he has tried to win over his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a box responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, that part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds a axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before it can take the drop.
Ultimately, unless there is a specific enterprise agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days &apos; salary, i.e. a minimum of 15 per cent of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-pay on civil servants in the event of low work (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days they apply in the private sector).
As these issues are discussed, most of them are also putting the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards abuse of work leave.
"The controls are going to be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is found committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of labour fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us look closely at the national figures first.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million was paid in occupational leave in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economics, subsidies for leave accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to maternity and occupational accident leave, while 54 per cent are related to sick leave, amounting to Euro6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days of work leave, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance Maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% from between 8 and 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health reasons and other) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Disease leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud is quite limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has caused controls on sick leave of more than 45 days to be systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out were "unjustified or too long" casualties, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of cases were considered to be "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unwarranted" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure by comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent losses of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and undoubtedly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papalymos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas said before Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he added that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the eurozone "plays at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with deficit and debt reduction targets, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8 billion euro loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised
Canadians live in denial of death, Royal Society of Canada report says
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9 percent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to that effect.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and physician.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia is allowed, when the patient raises this option and has been tried competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
On medication or not, 77 percent of Canadians don't have access to palliative care, experts selected by the Royal Canadian Society say.
And, even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 percent of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Ethanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practised, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is nearing relief from their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalising euthanasia will not suggest that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to persons who had committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents felt that a trial should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the report's authors.
In addition, among its recommendations they suggest that the removal of health care, if legally rejected, should be a criminal offence, among the Criminal Code, should be a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls for the training of health professionals to be trained to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the experts' report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill people.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also voiced her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as a "prosecutor for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, calls into particular question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President El Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Assad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, have spoken out in favour of President Assad's abandonment of power.
King Abdala II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of regime forces has already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime."
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tone" on repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem, considered that the country "advances towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco from its functions, which in his view is "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not falter," he added, ensuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, from the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is locked in "paranoia."
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to take place in Rabat tomorrow to finalize the implementation of the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the opposition-held cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League's decision "incorrect," while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan for the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks the markets for time and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated with the political parties yesterday and today met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a wide programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council-designate.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is "sure that markets will have patience and understand it."
His appointment by the president initially welcomed the markets, but concerns were later raised, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial output in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the next legislative elections, he believes.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he holds office, he will work in the light of urgency and with the aim of Italy "recovering its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigour measures.
Italian "chief of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berloconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy," according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in state obligations by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk, Oural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems reportedly led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He is then believed to have cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career in this technology on the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, statistics released by the FBI on Monday show.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again," said human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
The legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook's.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow the activity of other "Twittos," i.e. those netizens whose messages ("tweets") to be followed more readable and live.
This allows us to know if they follow up messages, if they are paid to new accounts, if they qualify a favorite for any message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being disseminated to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its unint instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus plus large avec un maniement plus celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google.
On the network, users have debated "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and looks too much like Facebook," he writes.
"The Activity function will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," he writes.
Austria
Introduction of a budget "golden rule" in the Constitution
The Government of a large Social-Democratic/Christian Democrat coalition in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the Constitution a budget "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA, we would have to pay an additional 3 billion euros in interest each year," said Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model," as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35 per year of GDP, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt should be reduced on the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Nod threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene the mark of the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to close to the historic peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massive yen per dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually going back since then, driven by investor purchases that consider it a "fifting value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was trading again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic barrage of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at about 120 yen and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the products of Made in Japan and reduces the value of income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Node, which fears that the increase in the yen will cortege the weak recovery.
The third world economic powerhouse has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister believes the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) by five trillion yen (519,000 million euros) to the threshold of the funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone's stability, European stock exchanges are plunging slightly further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent to 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
"Taking into account the new tensions over the lending yields of the most affected eurozone states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7 per cent fall, renewing market controllers' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and exchanges will continue to be made in a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the eurozone hits the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is still at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a 0.4 per cent drop.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the forecast 0.3 per cent, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the second quarter figure, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
Plus, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the eurozone as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is fitting that an election meeting is time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if it explores the set of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will have to be alleviated to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or Switzerland, which is only aimed at building state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of an interrupted power plant after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a speech.
The Berlin election is going to mean an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be thought.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, from which 30% of its electricity is also one of the large users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undermine the wonderful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to polls.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 manufacturing jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and can create non-offshortenable jobs.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the slaughter of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would command an EPR designed to run sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source either.
Areva's development of low-carbon nuclear and renewable CO2 solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over existing plants and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of renowned professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did of the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the RPA presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
As it is studied by all the electric players who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let excitement, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed "human rights country" status.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters."
However, it is rarely discussed economically.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a bit of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guidance by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will make it possible to solve the "immigration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The cap on immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly employs in sectors with a lack of employment.
Poorly qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the latter to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows represents an increase in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the points of growth that he lacked "with his teeth."
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a beautiful, but also fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some might believe that, for democracy to succeed definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon "the Little One," that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression," as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The paliny of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
This ambivalence must be reflected in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers no longer make good sense.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum high of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen.
No, we do not want to strike blows, but a common, full, quiet and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that lends itself to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, every one of its nations.
Most urgent is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be.
But thinking of it without further political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The interest-motivated Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved at the political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
"No contact" chip cards are generalised
The world chip card lounge kicks off on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet estimates.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year 460 million cards with contactless chip will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year.
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (eightly 580 million units) are expected to account for about 10% of the world chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million passer-free Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get the upper march in, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system," says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first stage towards the payment of the future: mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for conducting transactions.
"They're lagging behind".
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing to publish an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly through its mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris worries about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said Algiers already "has certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Raped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the researchers' interest: one leads to a long-time Nigerian who remained in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we certainly have to wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible".
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had proved increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of enlightened uninterested.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Nigeria's Muslim north.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a rapid success.
It is politicized and demanded strict respect for sharia law, while its militants are thrown into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are first oriented towards churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as is often widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has become radicalized and abandons its fiefdoms from the north.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, particularly the police guarded headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is of the concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with Goodluck Jonathan President Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, with Iran and with aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made increasingly thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The often infused slogans spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination for the "Great Old Party," has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in the face of an attitude that "flauntes" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter China's military threat because Beijing "tryes to develop nuclear capability," apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
People judge Obama's national security balance sheet, which ended Bin Laden, in a rather positive way.
From Iraq, it distrusts military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to rebuild economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea fund, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km that connect the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the ground run by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At the sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," Francois Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which the big contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect against the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Moller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entirety: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but project officials gave it up to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned society to establish itself permanently at sea off its coasts.
"In case of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Moller.
In the event of leakage, the gas pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have forecast joints that are expected to have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as through a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, in charge of building and operating the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable.
Afterwards, Gazprom rented to the company, for a period of twenty-five renewable years, all gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported," says Jens Moller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy pine-polted coast.
Valve, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the specific pressure, temperature and characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as once aging by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of designer but distinguished notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, mole skin (to mole skin), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to today's taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And it was successful.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years has been left, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italy's borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers in its infancy, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops of the city center, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, schedules, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Dealer?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made for fifteen years is considerable.
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be mentioned that the disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They are often older: 37 per cent are over 50 (on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent have not finished baccalaureate and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities," with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually deficient."
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a target set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We are now reaching around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution," as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among the big groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees on their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
On the verge of facing the Bleus on Tuesday night (20pm), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure this friendly game generates for them.
We will not dare say that collusion was noticed between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's grudge gesture against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and because he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set," he has justified himself.
"In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to be placed".
Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, taking this match against France in mind, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill."
Not forgetting the "pleasure".
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the "particular" nature of the meeting.
Especially because he will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ," he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Simply, Leekens has made reference to "pride."
"Pride" for playing "a gala match."
"Pride" also to check, as "neighbour," that France "is again a very high-level team," about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next few games". Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is facing a huge optimism of the back-to-back match against Bosnia (22h00), to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way game, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecao, which he has been running since September 2010, is going to qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems clear that things are not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't scored outside the house."
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as excited, even if it becomes clear that the party "is very equal," dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the game is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012," he said, however, relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house," Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think."
A good idea, as long as it is realistic this time.
