Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is a charismatic.
The Holy Masses for liberation and healing celebrated by him attract crowds.
He was a teenager when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through a Franciscan, others experience this.
Witko attracts crowds to the Holy Masses for liberation and healing
Once the parents of a 7-month-old baby came to him, who had a hole in the size of 7.5 mm.
It was to be operated.
Father Józef Witko prayed over him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The astonished doctors said: "No surgery is needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."
My parents cried with happiness.
After another prayer of the Franciscan, the hole disappeared completely.
The priest began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, souls in purgatory came to him asking for help.
I was woken up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
"My body started to change.
I lost my human qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not make a voice.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him help.
"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...", he says.
He told no one about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
The healing masses celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
This afternoon (26 September) Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed at home to the current champion Polish Darts Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Table Tennis Superleague.
Jarosław in such a personal combination, which they presented with Grodziszczanami, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
This was clearly shown by the duel with Darts Bogoria.
The team is still missing Chen Jingqi, hailed as the team leader.
Perhaps with him in the line-up, the Yaroslavl team would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win against such greats as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The competitor from Hellas was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were in a class of his own.
After three duels Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-set battle – Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
One could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han was not up to Badowski.
There will be no additional tests for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcements, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Health Technology and Tariffication.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease entities, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," it was written.
The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because the point is to lead to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"It is hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let's not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state," added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future Israeli government that is formed proceeds to implement this plan, we will annul all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened emphatically.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences may be – by fully committing ourselves to working for the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," declared the Palestinian Authority president, who has already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the outgoing prime minister of Israel, was again tasked with forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would declare the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to incorporate all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 90s. Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold general elections on Palestinian lands during a session of the UN General Assembly.
The last one took place in 2006.
"Upon my return, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.
In his speech, Abbas also defended the right of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the rights of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions."
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations in full respect."
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the UN on Palestinian Authority efforts against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in the PA under his leadership."
Danon, as the agencies note, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in critical points of Przemyśl
The story from the border crossing shows that an automated AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in sensitive points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl.
Trainee Daniel Cyrnek, senior trainee Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs and Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, received a phone call from the Communist Party secretary from her home village on September 23 to report that her husband had just died at a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body mangled beyond recognition.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood," the woman said.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of police officers around who wouldn't get close to Wang."
Police pressured her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident."
PLN 105 million for companies from the video game industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
On Friday, the National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.
Among the almost 30 projects supported by NCBR, there was, m.in. development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world along with an application enabling data transmission by users; a test and training platform for verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes, using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – according to the NCBR release sent to PAP on Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% annually.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
"A specially prepared GameINN research agenda and support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program, already reaching PLN 300 million, are a significant impulse for further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev," reads the press release.
The video games industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R+D discounts, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters of more entrepreneurs benefited from the R+D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
"The amount of deducted costs related to R+D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN", emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Wojciech Kamieniecki, PhD, Eng., Director of the NCBR, reminds that in the two previous competitions, 78 innovative projects were awarded with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the third competition and the variety of submitted applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"We are particularly pleased that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects related not only to entertainment, but also to industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of approx. PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information about the results of the III GameINN competition is available on the ncbr.gov.pl website.
The GameINN sectoral program is implemented as part of the Smart Growth Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, m.in such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajax Amsterdam at the end of August, realised after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
Not just any, because it is worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane did not show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP news agency, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch to the Dane.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He came to Nice as a thirteen-year-old, and three years later made his debut in the first team.
He appeared in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – according to the newspaper "L'Equipe" – the club will probably terminate him with immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you're washing your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And yet most of us wash them shorter!
All you need is warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
When washing, rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hand, but also: the tips of the fingers (joined or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (interlace your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb is covered with the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it for a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief, and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the handles or doors with washed hands (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iran's president says he has rejected the offer of talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran has not held talks with the U.S. side at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the U.S. to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks under maximum pressure
Iran's president said he had refused to hold the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."
He stated that he met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the persuasion of France, Germany and Great Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not enter into talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rouhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of supporting US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, despite the fact that he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: 'Iran Asked, I Said No'
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that it was he who rejected the request of the Iranian side.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said 'no!'" tweeted the US president.
Tension with nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 Iran deal to which they were signatories.
It stipulated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons program and bring the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has come of it.
Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive permission to export raw material, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia's hater, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, initiated explanatory proceedings against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet transformed into proceedings against him.
Although the Supreme Administrative Court, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in a hate group, will return to adjudicate and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the hate group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except falsified screenshots and the words of his wife, from whom he is divorcing.
Exactly the same thing is claimed by other judges associated with "Caste": everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will get their way.
Because the prosecutor's office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people who were identified as persecutors in a report from February by judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, there is no "Caste" case.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banas about renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA checks his declarations of assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Deputies' Ethics Committee will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow met to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banaś's deputies and appoint his lawyer as acting, although the law does not provide for such a bizarre combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a film novel, American I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She is so amazed and devastated that she cannot utter a word.
She stands in the doorway speechless, and at this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, darling?
Only that in the case of "Caste" or Banas it is a parody of the state.
And it's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season, the athlete, the bronze medalist of the world championships from London 2017, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second attempt.
She managed to get 1.94 only in the third attempt.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I can fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically," Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the preliminaries, the best turned out to be American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik – 1.94 each.
Both players were the only ones who did not knock down any height.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Starts at 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He was hospitalized, and doctors describe his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and aware.
"We believe that he will come out of this, that he will win again.
We all pray for him to recover," Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, said in an interview with the journalists of "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My closest family and politics keep me alive," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to journalists of "Super Express" two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was examined at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
"I developed strange, worrying symptoms and went to the hospital.
It turned out that I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", said the Prime Minister's father.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation in the hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
"I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have metastases.
I don't know yet if I'll be undergoing chemotherapy.
I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather of good cheer.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some kind of usable state.
I hope that everything will be fine," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with "SE" in January.
"If I had submitted to the examination too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this paddock ..." he added.

The power of Oława jumps.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competition, held on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.
There is a long way to true power, but this is the name given to one of the types of horse competition...
The competition of the power of jumping consists in overcoming by the rider and horse higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set back in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is not the worst either...
The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "In the saddle" was a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Equestrian Competition" held there a little earlier, about which we write in more detail in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons joined the competition, training horse riding in the Oława JKS.
Four competed on squats and four on large horses.
In the first group Nikola Szołdra did the best, riding the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but very dynamic steed began by overcoming obstacles spread over a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station, with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals he was removed from further competition by the competition jury.
The second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Fama", and the third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider".
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman - fought ambitiously galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the competing amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Dangerous-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, riding "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode on "Lotka".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the parkur had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.
Either the assistance of a trainer or another horse was needed, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".
After completing the obstacle from the parkur she also went down in full swing, so sometimes in the pits and on the expansion room it got dangerous. "Everything is under control!" reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.
From the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska performed well on the park, riding the beautifully presented "Whisky".
This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, at the second attempt in the final phase as the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.
After a while, however, the same height was also scored by Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka".
To decorate the flo and to receive material prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these athletes went together, and at the end, together with the amazons on ponies, in tact of Radecki's march, they made an impressive honorary round, ending this interesting and exciting competition.
Thanks
Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the competition of the power of jumping during the XVI "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Department of Water Supply and Sewage in Oława, the District Office and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko dissociates himself from Max Kolonko's KWW Patriotic Revolution
Max Kolonko's KWW Patriotic Revolution is the name of the election committee under which the political formation of the #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution addressed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and Max Kolonko's KWW Patriotic Revolution itself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with Max Kolonko's KWW Patriotic Revolution.
"I will expect the above-mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect me with the above-mentioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether this is the end of the formation #R Revolution.
On 4 July, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the USA, informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and in the world.
"We've had enough of politicians, enough of your stupid games, tired of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said at the time.
The party's manifesto includes issues m.in the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalising the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of NATO's eastern flank, with particular emphasis on Polish), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of MPs and introducing single-mandate constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the creation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately took place.
UBS: The zloty is close to the equilibrium point
"The euro exchange rate will remain around the 4.35 PLN level in the coming months, accompanied by a weak situation in global markets," said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak in favor of stabilizing the zloty's quotations at the current level," the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks ease policy.
"While the zloty is properly valued – the euro quotations should remain around the level of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not very attractive in his opinion.
Emerging market bonds offer much more favourable yields than Polish securities," said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global economic downturn.
"The global slowdown may deepen, but there should be no severe recession, or at most a fall in GDP growth slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should underweight global equities, which could be hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risks, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Among equity markets, Europe should be relatively the weakest," according to a new letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
"Eurozone equities should behave worse than US equities because they are more vulnerable amid heightened global trade uncertainty and fears of a slowdown," the document said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year bonds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.
However, in the longer term, yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the greatest room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is $1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for the single currency to strengthen against the dollar.
We expect further cuts in Fed rates, which will result in a narrowing of global monetary policy differentials.
"Current account and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to remain strong in the long term," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of National Defence
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential statement prepared by the German Ministry of Defence.
The information was reported by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of National Defence, Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 rounds of ammunition have been re-detected so far.
Military equipment that is still missing includes six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
Concern about the situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
She told RND that the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "staggering."
All the more so because as a result of the conducted investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment could be found.
Martina Renner summed up the results as a "miserable balance sheet".
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there are also weapons that were found during the investigation against Bundeswehr lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence endangering state security and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included, m.in, the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying babies on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for people who find traveling with a crying baby a nightmare.
Through the website, the airline allows you to check the schedule of seats on the plane.
If a minor under the age of two travels on a given connection, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place away from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that airlines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket was booked by a third party or if there was a change of aircraft at the last minute.
Unsurprisingly, the idea divided netizens.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-cancelling headphones.
They're children, we used to be children too.
"We need to learn tolerance because soon we will need a map of seats for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunkards," wrote user G Sundar.
Another netizen noted that he was once bothered by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children during the 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Mallorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in Mallorca in October as a result of Thomas Cook's bankruptcy announced on Monday.
Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, said on Friday that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Mallorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Mallorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, because Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands has already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the Mallorca market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca", more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 are redundant employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.
The remaining people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy in many hotels in Mallorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional fee for accommodation.
This situation was experienced, m.in by several dozen tourists from Polish.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday dozens of hotels in Mallorca had stopped operating until at least the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its partner companies.
In turn, Friday's daily "Diario de Ibiza" indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which cooperated with the Thomas Cook group, do not intend to close their outlets in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands announced that it would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, is in Mallorca.
According to data from the Balearic Islands government, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, around €5 million for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in the lead
The women's Polish national team is ranked 29th in the International Federation of Football Federation (FIFA) rankings published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous, July ranking.
Poor matches of the team.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained the Americans, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the German women, and the third by the Dutch.
Polish women are preparing for the European Championship qualification.
They were supposed to start them with an away match against the Czech Republic on September 3.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed for a year due to food poisoning of the opponents.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualifications with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, "White and Red" will play two friendly matches – on October 3 away with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Polish women are the national teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three runners-up advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six second-placed teams will play in the play-offs for the last three passes to the European Championship.
The field of 16 participants will be completed by the host – England.
The men's Polish national team dropped from 20th to 22nd place in the FIFA rankings in September.
"Rom": Smog crushed the government
"The effects of the 'Clean Air' programme are negligible, and coal furnaces will be digging this winter as if nothing had happened," reads the front page of today's Rzeczpospolita.
"So far, 82,000 applications for co-financing with a total value of PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the «Clean Air» program, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
The accepted applications amount to a total of over PLN 915 million," reports "Rom", citing data from the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is reimbursed from the program.
The results of the much-heralded programme are described by the daily as "modest".
Local governments, quoted by "Rom", see the failure of "Clean Air" m.in. in too much bureaucracy.
"The program should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve operations", believes the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński, Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alert note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the assumed goal of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved.
As noted by "Rom", although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion annually, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, only PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved," we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Polish
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
"This is one of the last steps before concluding the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favorable price," the minister added Polish.
Contract for Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force is to eventually power 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multirole fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of close support missions, bombing and typical fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Belgium recently bought F-35 fighter jets under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16 with them.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also expected to consider buying U.S. combat aircraft.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
In this way, he wants to fight stereotypes.
The manufacturer Barbie launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has launched gender-neutral dolls.
Toys from the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can go from girls to boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Emphasizing characteristic sexual features was also abandoned – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in the case of Ken – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," announces Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for propagating "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportion, for example.
The company has responded to the criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in a hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or a club Razem can have a dozen or so deputies
Zandberg asked on the radio ZET how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which candidates for the Sejm of SLD, Spring and Left Together, running with a common logo "Left"), answered that it depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people pin their hope on the fact that the Left is not only right, but also strong," he stressed.
According to Zandberg, it follows that the left can have 60-80 deputies.
"This may mean that the circle or club Razem will have a dozen or so deputies.
But it depends on Poles.
I'm not going to guess and say how it's going to happen," he said.
When asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that Poles rewarded this diversity, because we showed that by differing we were able to agree on a common program."
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are center-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, to the remark that the SLD will get the whole subvention, he replied that "the goal of a political party is to represent its voters."
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the Senate elections, he indicated that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"However, I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District No. 44, I would take my election certificate and vote in another district," the politician emphasized.
"I don't think I would be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO - PAP candidate)," he added.
In this constituency, apart from Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland, Paweł Kasprzak, and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are running.
Dakar: Largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque believed to be West Africa's largest.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque with a capacity of 30,000 worshippers was built.
The facility was built by the Mouride brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi current of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began a decade ago on a six-hectare wetland donated by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the nineteenth-century founder of the brotherhood, revered by his followers as a saint.
The mosque is clad in Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque inside will accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the same number can stay on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca has a capacity of 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and 10.5 million euros worth of roadworks.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The streak of eight league matches without a win Korona players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the league Silesia.
"Our problem is not Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.
Korona's players recorded the last and so far the only victory in the league in the first round, when they defeated Raków Częstochowa 1-0 away.
Later, Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0: 1 with Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
"It fills me with optimism that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the pitch after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," the coach added.
In Friday's match in Korona certainly will not play pausing for excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, in the squad will also be missing injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
However, it is encouraging to report in a cup match of several players with the desire to play.
"We have a headache, not long ago it seemed that it would not be, and now it is," said Smyła.
Defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the league anyone can win with anyone.
"We're a good team.
In recent weeks we may not show it on the pitch, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday," he said.
After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, Korona is in 15th position with five points.
Silesia gathered 12 more and ranks second.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees could disappear from Europe altogether
"42% of the tree species that make up Europe's forest stand are under threat," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red List of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are m.in chestnut and mountain ash.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was prepared by specialists who, based on research, came to the conclusion that out of 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as in other places of the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons for the Red Book, the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change are the causes.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European stand, according to IUCN specialists, 58 percent of species are threatened, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red List mentions errors in the exploitation of tree stands, accelerated urbanisation, excessive felling of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.
"The consequences of human activity are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and are putting Europe at risk of extinction of important and undervalued varieties that underpin Europe's ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN European office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for their freedom, which future generations will have to repay," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, "the whole policy of PiS is to drink."
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.
"Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal country than supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed the values proclaimed such as modesty, humility and transparency," says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.
"First of all, nothing given will be taken away, but you have to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Polish, which can be seen even in dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work diligently - and those who are enterprising".
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes m.in project that will give the lowest earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he does not want to race for giveaways.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he will not promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition for giveaways, until finally the financial collapse of the country took place," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview for "Rom" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"Pride walks before the fall.
Kaczyński is such a statesman as Banaś is a crystal man," he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether he will run for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead giant condors
Six dead giant condors have been found in the Argentinian province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.
Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Giant condors were probably poisoned with a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.
The animals could eat toxic carrion.
Apart from one young specimen, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"This is a big loss for the environment because a condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinian environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rom": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the law firm of Andrzej Duda – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".
As the newspaper explains, it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.
The last time it was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
"Rom" reports that soon such a chain may end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday on a motion to work on an amendment to the law on orders and decorations in order to restore it.
The daily writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time the work is lightning fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, deciding that they would consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I would like to kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," wrote the presidential minister Andrzej Dera at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The Chancellery of the President answered us briefly: it is in favor of restoring it," said the head of the commission Robert Mamątow from PiS, quoted by "Rom".
He tabled a proposal for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be carried out, m.in. at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.
The actions of uniformed officers are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "Passable intersections".
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of exiting, not following light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, but in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city, a few days ago.
His words resounded at the press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers to be reasonable on the road and m.in faster starting at traffic lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by Rzeszów policemen, who from today begin the action "Passable intersections".
What's going on?
The aim of the activities is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a common offence that contributes to the intensification of traffic difficulties and the creation of traffic jams.
It is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniformed officers will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of smoothness of driving, late starting from under the signals, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too large distances between vehicles.
At which intersections will the activities be carried out?
M.in. on Lisa-Kuli Street with Jagiellońska Street; al. Cieplińskiego from al. Piłsudskiego; Targowa Street with Piłsudskiego Avenue; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Powstańców Warszawy Avenue.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on subsequent Fridays of October.
They inspected the company disposing of waste from "Czajka"
"Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wołomin County and the District Inspection of Building Supervision inspected on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka" in Warsaw is utilized," said Karol Szyszko, spokesman for the Wołomin County.
Inspectors from the Wołomin starosty carried out an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka commune.
Private Trade and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the agreement with the capital sewage treatment plant "Czajka" performs sewage waste management services.
"The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his business," said Szyszko.
He added that the inspection report will be forwarded, m.in, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in "Dar-Trans" was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection of WIOŚ, Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Private Trade and Transport Plant "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the "Czajka" treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste utilization in the excavation area, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was taken out of operation, which was related to damage to one of the incinerator devices.
As MPWiK informed, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my total support," Lech Wałęsa said to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr. President, for me these are very important words," replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now "just a retired fan".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Walesa on Friday in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
Walesa's son Jarosław also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You have undertaken a difficult task," Lech Wałęsa said after the meeting.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
"The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is very hoped that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible," said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for the support.
"Mr. President, for me these are very important words, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows how important it is," she said.
"Let's show that it is possible to do different, wise politics, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Błońska emphasized.
Retired fan
Walesa told reporters that he was now "just a retired fan."
"Of course, I'm looking at it.
I hope that we will turn the tide, that what was good, proven, (to this) we will return.
The separation of powers is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned, everything needs to be restored to normal operation, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we will face a street criterion", said Lech Wałęsa.
"That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the elections, think and make their own decision.
And this is the most important thing," added Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that we will improve the state of affairs in Poland with a piece of paper," the former president replied.
"We need to rebuild the foundation"
When asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The president said very well.
We have to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If the separation of powers does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and make it obvious and so that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward."
European Volleyball Championship: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with Slovenians in the semi-final of the European Championships.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussions with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White and Red" lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate decided on key bills
The Senate adopted without amendments the bills on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted for the amendment to the law on the property of families of civil servants – without amendments – 14 were against and three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments proposed during Wednesday's debate by the senator of the Civic Platform Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the act and limit the scope of information provided in the declaration on the financial situation of own children, children of the spouse, adopted children to cases in which the children remain in a common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was drafted by the Prime Minister's Office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.
The regulations assume that m.in prime minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as heads of other state institutions will be obliged to include in the declaration of assets information about the personal property of spouses, children and cohabitants.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes along with the most important people in the state.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators voted for the bill – without amendments – 12 were against and four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "performed in an official mission."
The president will be able to be accompanied on flights by family members and other persons invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight "carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed".
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; as well as journalists.
According to the Act, in the event of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister will apply for their clarification.

Poles after the first training in Paris, are waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training on Friday in Paris, where on Saturday they will play in the bronze medal match.
Vital Heynen's charges ended their way to win the title with Thursday's defeat against Slovenia 1: 3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their problems with traveling to this duel.
This time there were no such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the accounts of people present at the classes, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.
"We went to the arena, but for the most part it was time for the team.
The idea was to spend it together rather than train.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
"We were brutally brought down to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed that we would come back to this match.
We discussed this match among ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for failure, I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual handling of situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analysed.
In his opinion, the "White and Red" was not hindered by the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted, however, that the world champions could have been put to sleep by a smooth road to the semi-finals.
"Perhaps if we had lost in a similar style in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and then we would have played differently later in the tournament.
But that's just a guess," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will be turned into aggression in the match for bronze.
"I hope that we will show our true colors then.
There is a lot to fight for.
The last time we won a medal at the European Championships was in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-finals they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe but suspended punishment
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban from competing and a $25,000 fine – suspended six months – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions at recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks menacing – 16 weeks off plus a hefty fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a probationary period in which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been making trouble for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a lost match with Karen Khachanov – all this after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August paid $ 113,000.
He didn't play long in the 2019 U.S. Open either, but he managed to publicly say that ATP officials "are corrupt," which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on suspension of starts and another fine.
However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption, after listening to the accused and learning the context of the statement.
However, tennis officials said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he had constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering that several conditions be met within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, he can no longer swear, destroy rackets, argue with referees and the public,  or any other way to behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek "ongoing support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who are not coping with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Laver Cup he suffered a shoulder injury, so he had to give up the next starts in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over $ 1.3 million, so even after fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
The report on household budgets published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office shows that it assessed its financial situation as good or rather good last year. as many as 44 percent of them.
A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2 per cent, in 2016 it was 33.5 per cent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it has never exceeded 30 per cent.
Last year, it considered its financial situation to be bad or rather bad. A total of 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and over 20% in 2009.
The best is the financial situation of the households of the self-employed.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the other extreme are pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 percent.
The subjective assessment of the financial situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.
Single parents are the worst off, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and large families (with at least three children) assessed their worst financial situation.
The improvement of subjective assessments of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of a rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships, there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to last year. less than 94 per cent of the national average, and in Lubuskie 98 per cent.
The highest incomes were recorded by residents of Mazowieckie (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesia (104 per cent).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person in 2018 amounted to PLN 1693.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7 per cent, and a year later by 6.3 per cent.
While revenue growth is slowing, it is also slowing down spending growth.
Those per capita amounted to last year. PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household now spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it was above 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the crew of an aircraft carrier
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred ashore while the USS George H. W. Bush was moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded in the case.
In addition, deaths are not to be related.
"We need everyone to get involved in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help," Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
Niesiołowski criticizes the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Pretty much every sentence he said was accepted."
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk casts a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Polish – developed his media in the best during the lifetime of the Polish Pope," he explained.
The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: 'there were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do it, neither did his successors," explained Niesiołowski.
"Besides, there was this fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their lack.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to the entirety of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively short time.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters," says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.
In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform Polish the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.
"We must admit that in the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All celebrations began with a holy mass, crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are PiS, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the PiS regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will have to pay dearly," argued Niesiołowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.

PZPN showers penalties for brawls at stadiums.
Griffin disqualified
The clash in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk almost ended tragically when the flare fired by the fans from Wejherowo passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, by millimeters.
After this incident, the match was abandoned for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to travel in groups to league matches until December 31.
Brawls at the Widzew Łódź stadium were also caused by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.
Here, however, the PZPN verdict was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed flares to be thrown at the Łódź fan sector, chairs were set on fire and the hosts sector were pushed through.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and forbade the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also covered Ekstraklasa league matches, but there it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the m.in of writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set up at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment to the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that place names in neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in the law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the signposts by our roads.
We start the introduction of the new marking from the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway", informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set up at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand PLN
In the first place, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
There will be no exchange of boards, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning place names with new ones, written in Polish on the already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, and then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great convenience for people who do not know the spelling of names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan with an air rifle
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had set a target out of the animal – a pellet from an air rifle was found in its body.
"Information about the injured bird was received from the inhabitants of the village of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sól.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray it was already known that someone had made a shooting target out of it.
There were fragments of pellets in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the m.in rehabilitation center.
Winters in the resort
"The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the resort where it will spend the whole winter.
We are trying to strengthen it.
For now, he is not able to fly.
Releasing him now would mean that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," adds Walasek.
The staff after undergoing rehabilitation of the swan intends to release it in the spring into the same pond.
The authorities of the Żukowice commune, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The incident took place in Zameczno
Gowin: "we need to stimulate Polish, small trade"
"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.
Gowin during an interview in "Signals of the Day" in the radio "Jedynka" stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term, but got "a counter from the EC".
"We won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade".
"This will have to be considered whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had erred in finding that Polish retail tax was unlawful state aid.
The Act on the tax on retail sales assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the structure of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered state aid.
It then found that the levy had been unlawfully implemented.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until officials in Brussels have completed their analysis.
Poland disagreed, but tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the matter.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to several months from filing an appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
"This procedure takes an average of one year," a source at the Court in Luxembourg told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We suggest some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.
No wonder that new mums and dads want their child to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child's outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores you can find many stylish sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, babies a few weeks old were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same barrels or large pillows.
Today, children who approach the sacrament are often older: a few months, a year old, or even older.
It is not difficult to guess that such a large consolation needs a slightly different garment for baptism.
Therefore, if your child will be 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a stroller or in the hands of parents or godparents.
The best solution will therefore be to decorate it with comfortable, cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this item of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.
For a boy, a body with a bow tie and braces print will be perfect.
For older children, you can afford more fantasy in dress.
The girl will look cute in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls look longingly towards richly decorated, frilly christening dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers for their manufacture use artificial, non-breathable materials, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of suitable clothes, it will be better to look into the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliqués and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys there was a fashion for suits that were copies of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caps often made young elegant people loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, sweatpants shorts, and a blouse decorated at the front with a vest pattern.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of a toddler learning about the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a declaration of financial interests
Krystyna Pawłowicz submitted a declaration of financial interests at the end of the term of office.
It shows that the PiS MP has accumulated 110,000 zlotys in savings.
Recall that Pavlovich announced her departure from politics.
At the end of the term of office, he has the amount of PLN 110,000
According to the statement made by the MP, she receives a pension with a monthly value of 4.7 thousand. zł.
Pawłowicz owns a flat worth PLN 570,000 and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at 150 thousand. zł.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a declaration of financial interests.
Vote on adjournment of the session during the Conservative Party conference
British MPs have voted against a three-day recess of the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual policy conference, as requested by the government.
289 MEPs voted in favour and 306 against.
Normally, the House of Commons does not sit during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign from either party conferences or parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties decided that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the planned exit of Great Britain from the European Union on October 31, the parliament should not interrupt its session.
The government's request for a break was supported by 289 MPs, 306 were against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent to the recess may be perceived as a political revenge of the opposition against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and null and void by the Supreme Court) and for the fact that after the judges' ruling he does not want to apologize for it.
Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
"It's time to deliver Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be delivered so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition parties – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications given by Johnson to explain such a long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media write.
The president's spokesman strongly denied these reports.
"This is simply not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, m.in "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York stated that Israel is to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk."
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Pole, Pole".
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to the interlocutors of "JI", during the meeting there was also a dispute between a Holocaust survivor, decorated with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg reportedly agreed with President Duda's words and said that Jews from Israel "like Israel Kac" are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who is Banaś and what is his fault?
The tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banaś's property declarations.
We sum up another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
Journalists of "Superwizjer" TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Audit Office, in recent years did not enter a 400-meter tenement house in Krakow's Podgórze district in his property declaration.
What's more, his subtenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms by the hour).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly a collateral for loan repayment since 2016.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to irregularities in the "Superwizjer" program.
The journalist revealed that the tenement house was rented from Banas by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banaś answered the accusations vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banaś's property declarations.
The tenement house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.
"The property of Marian Banas and his wife may be worth from 6 to 8 million zlotys.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently auditing Marian Banaś's asset declarations for the years 2015–2019.
Banaś announced that he would suspend his activity in NIK until it is completed. "I will apply to the Speaker for unpaid leave," he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
"We do not hear that the CBA expanded its investigation or accelerated the examination of Marian Banaś's asset declarations.
Therefore, we are forced to replace the state authorities and report the possibility of committing a crime [...], "- said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.
"If a normal Pole valued the rental of his real estate so grossly, he would already have 10 inspections, tax surcharge and penal-fiscal proceedings," he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banaś is the new President of the Supreme Audit Office.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was proposed by the Law and Justice party and accepted by the votes of politicians of this party.
Previously, Banaś was associated with NIK in the years 1992-2005, he was active in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of a certain behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
Police trade unionists want to introduce such a change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" determined that the petition that the Independent Police Trade Union writes to MPs regarding the amendment of the Code of Misdemeanors has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Petty Offences.
It would read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be punished with arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
"Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who, by disobeying orders, prevent or hinder the performance of an official activity," the daily reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposed regulation, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in matters of political demonstrations.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be disadvantageous and instead of easing the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in a row with Václav Havel.
Therefore, from the very beginning there was a curse of talent hanging over Jáchy, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with "Sensitive Man".
The protagonists are Buras and Soňa with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are itinerant actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are only a background to observe the world, in which there is no place for artistic nomads.
It is a world of flea-clogged provinces, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
"Sensitive Man" sometimes turns into an absurd theater.
The narrative imitates didaskalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The stage is a Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared three Belgian subsidiaries bankrupt: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of the British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office reassured then that customers who bought trips there would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that in addition to the £900m rescue plan already agreed in August, the company should raise an additional £200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies tend to have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for feedback
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer has been prepared for newcomers by the German Görlitz.
The activities are to help in the fight against the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
In order to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.
Two-thirds of them were submitted by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
"When we applied, we thought the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel like it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from program participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, who is responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma.
