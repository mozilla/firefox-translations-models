Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
For the Masses he celebrates for release and healing, they draw crowds.
He was a dozen years old when inexplicable things started to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
On the check-in by o. Witko Masses for release and healing draw crowds
Once came to him parents of a 7-month-old baby, who had a hole in the heart of 7.5 mm.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
Later that day, the boy was taken to the hospital for the procedure.
Astonished doctors said, “Surgery is not needed, the cavity is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The priest began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In dreams came to him the souls of Purgatory asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment," he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost people's qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal," she says.
The invisible force lifted him up, he could not bring out his voice.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him the rescue.
“Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a vocation in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In the sermons, he didn’t just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease are involved in the masses for healing celebrated by Witko’s father.
The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
This afternoon (26 September) the Kolping FRAC team deservedly received the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Super League Table Tennis.
The Jarosławians in such a personal statement, which they presented with the fortified, have a slim chance of winning the league with the sovereigns.
This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the line-up the Yaroslavans would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown to win against such tussles as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the hall of MOSiR at ul. Sikorski in Jarosław.
Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class unto itself.
After three matches, the Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five-set fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lea a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't live up to Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why? Why?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group had been wrongly selected.
“The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in access to NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive result of research,” it said.
The decision of the ministry does not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have donted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then later they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government here has a very strange position that I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It is difficult for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let’s not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I am not surprised that there is a health service in such a state,” added the politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements so far
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday at a session of the U.N. General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel that arises proceeds to implement this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas threatened with emphasis.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - of little importance, what the consequences will be - by engaging entirely in action for the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," declared the Palestinian Authority President, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was once again given a mission to form a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won them, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.
In the early 90's. Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements, which were patronized by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during the U.N. General Assembly session.
The last one was in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, in Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech to the international community with a call to "force Israel to fulfill with all respect for the provisions of the United Nations."
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "willingly focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than to fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership."
Danon, as the agencies note, did not, however, refer to the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Rescuers want defibrillators at sensitive points of Przemyśl
History from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save people's lives.
The Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in sensitive points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Ambulance Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Trainee Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed an unconscious man in the pedestrian traffic zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, called the Communist Party secretary from her home village on September 23 to report that her husband had just died at a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of the death – he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognized.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood,” the woman says.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phones with me, and there were a lot of police officers around that wouldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police were pressuring her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and died of an "unhappy accident."
105 million PLN for companies from the video game industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost 105 million PLN of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the nearly 30 projects that NCBR supported, there was a m.in. development of a platform for creating off-road games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling the transfer of data by users; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development with the use of VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the virtual world
The aim of the GameINN sectoral program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game manufacturers on the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to 1.85 billion PLN, while the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs already reaching 300 million PLN under this sectoral programme provide an important impulse for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” the company said.
The video game industry is a perfect example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R&D reliefs, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also stay in their pockets – three-quarters of more entrepreneurs benefited from the relief for R&D in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to 1.7 billion PLN, which gave over 300 million PLN of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN," emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of NCBR Dr. Eng. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the previous two competitions co-financing with a total value of over 211.2 million PLN was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The great interest in the third competition and the variety of proposals shown that the video game industry has ideas and competences to continue to develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly welcome that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia with scientific units could apply for co-financing of up to 20 million PLN.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of funding approx. 317 million PLN.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was 100 million PLN, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost 105 million PLN of funding.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs affiliated to the Polish Games Agreement, which includes m.in. such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga pleads guilty to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The incident happened on September 16.
Dolberg, who hit from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any, because it's worth 70 thousand euros.
The angry Dane the next day did not appear in class, explaining himself with stomach problems.
The case was puzzling from the beginning.
Footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other team-mates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He joined Nice as a thirteen-year-old and made his first team debut three years later.
He has featured in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – according to the newspaper L’Equipe – the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you are washing your hands well
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
Most of us wash them shorter!
All you need is warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
Washing, rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hand, but also: the tips of the fingers (connected or individually) – rub them with circular movements against the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (intertwine your hands, rubbing your fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb we embrace with the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it moment to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can not wash your hands) we should wipe our hands with a wet handkerchief, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door handles or doors with your hands washed (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
Iran's president says he has rejected a proposal to talk to the U.S., Donald Trump denies it
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. side during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the U.S. has proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for entering into negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and the ballistic missile construction program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he had refused to take up those talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."
He declared that he had met with American diplomats because he succumbed to the urges of France, Germany and Britain.
But he stressed that Iran would not hold talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
A day earlier, the Iranian leader had said he did not rule out talks with the U.S., and that the European sides of the nuclear deal had accused the US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a prerequisite that does not allow" to establish dialogue.
If we can abolish this prerequisite and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America.
He added that he would not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the past week during the U.N. General Assembly.
Trump: 'Iran asked, I said no'
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said "no!" the president tweeted.
Tension with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and Britain are trying to alleviate tensions between Washington and Tehran to save the 2015 Iran deal, of which it was signatories.
It stipulated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector would put the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under scrutiny.
Since the U.S. withdrawn from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has come of it.
Washington employs the tactics of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against the judges, was restored on Wednesday to the ruling by the NSA.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of the President of the WSA Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet evolved into proceedings against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its release.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly talked about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participating in a hate group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to the ruling and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims there is no evidence of this except for the falsified screenshots and words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
Exactly the same is said by the other judges associated with "Casta": everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And quite possibly they'll put on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, and he is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which the phone stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a report from February.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, no “Caste” case.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banas about renting a tenement house to the pimps and hiding income.
The CBA is reviewing his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Committee on Deputies’ Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission somehow gathered to make a strange decision to dismiss the replacements of Banaś and appoint as a lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with a mistress in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated that she can't say a word.
She stands in the doors dumbfounded, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband makes the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?
Only in the case of "Caste" or Banaś, there is a parody of the state.
And it's not funny at all.

Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He was hospitalized and his medical examiners describe his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe he will come out of it, that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover," Kornel Morawiecki's anonymous loved one told the Super Express reporters.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father is running for Senate.
"I'm kept alive by my immediate family and politics," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to Super Express reporters two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been examined at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I reported to the hospital.
It turned out that I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer..." the prime minister's father said.
A few days later, at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent major surgery.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain Father Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and proceeded successfully.
“I know that a lot of people prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this severe operation, I have to go back to some kind of usability.
I hope that everything will be all right," Kornel Morawiecki said in a conversation with "SE" in January.
“If I had undergone the examination too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this thing already...”

The power of Oława jumping.
The title of the relationship from amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
To the true power, the road is a long way away, but this is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The jumping power competition consists in overcoming by the rider and the horse the ever-higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
It is worth mentioning here that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not the worst...
Competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS “W saddle”, were a show part of the “Rainbow Equestrian Competitions” played there, about which we write more broadly in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons, riding in Oława JKS, joined the competition.
Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy “Sprinter”, performed best.
This small but dynamic horse began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was removed from further competition by the jury of the competition.
The second place in the pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding “Famy” and third place was taken by Lena Boruń on “Harmider”.
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare "Carmen" fought ambitiously.
Even more emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and viewers during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The dangerous-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, who was riding the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on “Lotka”.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing a young mare “Wineta” to the park was had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.
You needed either a coaching assist or another horse to pair, followed by a bit of a crazy "Vineta."
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also descended full of trouble, so sometimes in the cubicles and on the expansion room it became dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz reassured some of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the competition, Marta Masalska has performed well in the park, riding a beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This dignified mare, paired with an experienced Amazon, the second approach in the final phase was the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at the moment.
After a while, however, the same height was also included by Paulina Szewczyk on the “Declaration”, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on “Winet” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lotka”.
So all these players left together to decorate the flo and to collect the prizes in kind in the form of equestrian equipment, and finally together with the amazons on ponies in the bar of the Radecki march, they made an impressive round of honor, ending with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thanks
The Equestrian Sports Club “W Sadle” sincerely thanks the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th “Rainbow Equestrian Competition”: the Municipal Office in Oława, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage in Oława, the District Office and the “Mustang” company.
Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW Max Kolonko Patriotic Revolution
The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of #R Revolution by Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution led its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko itself failed to even collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his partnership with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the above mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect me with the above mentioned entity," he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the United States, announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of the politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said at the time.
The party’s program included issues concerning the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equation of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to NATO’s eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the creation of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile a message suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually happened.
UBS: Gold close to the equilibrium point
“The euro exchange rate will remain around the ceiling of 4.35 zlotys in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets,” said Michael Bolliger from the company UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing the zloty’s quotations at the current ceiling,” the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide on rate hikes in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
“While the zloty is properly valued – euro quotations should remain in the coming months around the ceiling of 4.35 zlotys – according to him, Polish bonds are not attractive.
Much more favorable yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets," said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the downturn in the world.
“The global slowdown may be even deepening, but there should be no severe recession, and at most a GDP dynamics below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should underestimate global stocks that could be harmed by the lack of prospects for a resolving trade conflict on the U.S.-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively weakest," according to the latest letter to investors by the main manager of UBS Wealth Management, Marek Haefele.
“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-years even to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.
However, in the long term, the yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term securities, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.
The Fed has the biggest field for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the horizon of the following years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro's quotations is the US$1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed's rates, which will result in a decrease in differences in monetary policy in the world.
“The long-term strength of the dollar may not be allowed by current and budget account deficits,” said Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing weapons.

Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19 445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential statement drawn up in the German defence ministry.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defense, Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far managed to re-trace two weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 rounds of ammunition.
Among the military equipment that remains missing are, among others: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left party, Martina Renner.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition pieces is "perplexing."
All the more so because as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "wretched balance sheet."
She also criticised the fact that it was not clear from the statement whether there were also weapons found during the investigation against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations against leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
On his "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, they found themselves m.in. Heiko Maas, then Minister of Justice, Claudia Roth of the Green Party, and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There's a solution
Japan Airlines has recently been using a function designed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a given call travels a minor to the age of two, then the “child icon” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or guardians of the seat.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place distant from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airline has already reported on the shortcomings of the solution.
A “child icon” will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As expected, the idea divided Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be children too.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will start to need a map of seats for breathable mouths, drooling or drunk," wrote user G Sundar.
Another Internet user noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca counts losses after Thomas Cook travel agency bankrupt
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a holiday to Majorca as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
According to the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers, who due to the bankruptcy of a British company had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month, are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the estimates of the Diario de Mallorca newspaper, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are laid-off employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, the owners of the facilities demanded that guests pay an additional fee for the night.
This situation was experienced by m.in. several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had halted operations until at least the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.
In turn, Friday's daily Diario de Ibiza indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have worked with the Thomas Cook group, are not wearing with the intention of closing facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic autonomous authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most tourists injured in this archipelago, about 36 thousand people, are located in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is in arrears for local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.
FIFA women's ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in the lead
The women's national team of Poland is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak staff matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained American women, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by the Germans, and the third remained Dutch.
Polish women are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start the away match against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by a year due to food poisoning of opponents.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualification with the Spanish on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3 on a trip with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the Polish rivals are the teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the top three teams from second places will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barracks for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The stakes of 16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
Poland's men's national team in the September FIFA rankings fell from 20th to 22nd place.
“Rz”: Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the ‘Clean air’ program are slim, and coal furnaces will be kicking this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the front page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
“So far, 82 thousand applications for co-financing with a total value of 2 billion PLN have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
Accepted applications amount to over 915 million PLN in total," reports "Rz", citing data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced program are assessed by the journal as "modest".
Local government officials, quoted by “Rz”, see the failure of the “Clean Air” m.in. in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would improve the activities”, believes the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1 percent of the assumed target of replacing 3 million mounding boilers was achieved.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is 103 billion zlotys for 10 years, i.e. annually 10 billion zlotys, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, only 1.4 billion PLN were reserved for this year,” we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the contract, but not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Agreement for Polish F-35
The Polish air force will eventually power the 32 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support national security and the foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay 6.5 billion dollars for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the performance of engineering, logistics and staffing services, and related elements of logistics support and program and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighter Jets
The F-35 Lightning II fighter jet produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seater and single-engine fifth-generation multi-purpose fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombing and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, F-35 fighter jets bought Belgium under a contract worth $4.5 billion.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16.
The purchase of U.S. warplanes is also to be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls to the market.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" wear wigs.
Children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
It also gave up highlighting the distinctive sexual characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in Ken’s case – wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a specific gender in mind inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel announces.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for propagating "unhealthy female stereotypes," such as, for example, the unnatural proportion of the body.
The company reacted to the criticism and has already introduced dolls of different skin colors to the market, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: the circle or club Together can have a dozen MPs
Zandberg, when asked on the ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left Together Sejm start, starting with the common logo “Left”), replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 MPs.
“This may mean that the circle or club Together will have a dozen or so members.
But it depends on the Polish and Polish.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how this is going to happen," he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are scheduled to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by Poles, because we showed that by differing, we were able to get along with the common program.”
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Vladimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion, the biggest beneficiaries are the center-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, noting that the SLD will get the entire subsidy, he replied that "the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents."
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the event of an election to the Senate, he indicated that he was considering.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer, to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further away,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the No. 44 Senate district, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district,” the politician stressed.
“I would not be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (KO candidate - PAP),” he added.
In this district, apart from Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are taking part.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by buses, cars and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30 thousand faithful.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi stream of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, handed over by the government.
The name of the Mosque Massalikul Jinan (“Paths to Paradise”) comes from the title of the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, worshipped by followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Karrary marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle accommodates 15 thousand faithful, and the second can be held on the external esplanade.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the gold-plated dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations made by the workers from Morocco.
The builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice has no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was funded by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitary facilities and financed roadworks worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The streak of eight league matches without a victory, the Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Extraclass.
“Our problem is not the Wrocławians, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” emphasized Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when on the trip they defeated 1:0 Benjamin of the competition Raków Częstochowa.
Later, the Kielceans recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I’m optimistic that in the final seconds of the cup game the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the final whistle did not result from the breakdown, only it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will be sensitive to the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” he added.
In Friday's match in the Crown, he will certainly not play Ognjen Gnjatic, who will be injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski, who are injured in the frame.
It is building, however, to report in a knockout match several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be there, and now it is,” Smyła stated.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the extraclass anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
In recent weeks, we may not show it on the pitch, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday," he said.
After nine rounds of the Extraclass, the Crown with five points is ranked 15th.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.
Friday's match in Kielce will begin at hour. 20:30.
These trees could disappear completely from Europe
"42 percent of the species of trees that make up Europe's tree stand are at risk," the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns in a "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.
At the top of the list are m.in. chestnuts and rowan.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was prepared by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that out of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42 percent are "highly endangered."
Among the causes, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European stand, according to IUCN specialists, 58 percent of species are threatened, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs are in danger of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanization, too intensive felling of trees, and then forest fires and changes occurring in the European eco-stystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.
“The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of the extinction of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” concluded report Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
“Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for freedom a giveaway for a loan that future generations will have to pay,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is a pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."
Schetyna assures Jacek Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski's party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has embodied the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also emphasized the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
“First of all, nothing that is given will be taken away, but you have to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a m.in. project, which will give more about 614 zlotys per hand to Poles earning the least earners, and more earners – also several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for a giveaway.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition for the giveaway until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.
Schetyna in an interview with “Rz” also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Hubris walks before the fall.
Kaczynski is such a statesman as Banaś is crystal," he added.
The leader of the OP also said that he has not yet decided whether he will apply to chair the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead condors great
Six dead condors of the great have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The great condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic carcass.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
“It’s a big loss for the environment because the condor must reach 10–15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we're losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic lure and poison puts not only this species in danger, but all other life forms, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s office – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time President Ignacy Mościcki used it was probably.
“Rz” says that soon such a chain could hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on the amendment of the Orders and Awards Act to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost in one vote.
This time the work is lightning fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I would like to inform you kindly that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote the Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s Office replied briefly: it is in favour of restoring this,” said the head of the committee, Robert Mamątow of PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He tabled a motion to take up the legislative work that the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted m.in. at the intersection of al. Ciepliński from al. Piłsudski.
The actions of uniformed people have to do with the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave appropriately at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów “Passable intersections”.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, not following light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, the city’s vice-president, a few days ago.
His words sounded at the press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars around the intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers to be sensible on the road and m.in. to move faster at traffic lights or not to text while driving.
The topic was taken over by the Rzeszów policemen, who from today begin the action "Passable intersections".
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of reducing the mobility at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing the ride.
It is a frequent offense that contributes to intensifying traffic difficulties and creating traffic jams.
It is threatened with a fine of 300 zł and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of driving fluidity, late start from under the beacons, slow passing of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will activities be carried out?
M.in. on the street. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellonian; al. Ciepliński from al. Piłsudskiego; ul. Targowa z al. Piłsudskiego; Śreniawitów Square with ul. Dąbrowskiego or ul. Hetmańska from al. Warsaw insurgents.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be conducted on the next Fridays of October.
They inspected the company disposing of waste from "Czajka"
“The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wołomiński County and the District Inspectorate of Construction Supervision inspected on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the wastewater treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of,” said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the Wołomiński County.
Inspectors from the Wołomiński district carried out inspections in a plant located in forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The Private Commercial and Transport Plant “Dar-Trans”, under an agreement with the capital’s wastewater treatment plant “Czajka” performs waste management services.
“The inspection of the installation was carried out, in addition, the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to the activity carried out by him,” said Szyszko.
He added that the audit report will be forwarded m.in. to the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period of 29 December 2015. – 11 February 2016
It was then determined that the company did not take samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” wastewater treatment plant.
After the inspection of the Village, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out the disposal of waste in the excavation site, waste weighing up to 60 000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was excluded from operation, which was related to the damage to one of the equipment of the incinerator.
According to MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is 1.7 million PLN (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walesa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my total support,” Lech Walesa said to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska on Friday.
“Mr. President, for me these are very important words,” replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now "only a supporter in retirement."
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Walesa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
The son of Walesa – Jarosław also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken on a difficult task," Lech Walesa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my total support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible," said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for her support.
“Mr. President, for me, these are very important words, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important it is,” she said.
“Let us show that one can do a different, wise policy together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
You did your revolution, and we want to change Poland,” emphasized Kidawa-Błońska.
A supporter in retirement
Walesa, in a conversation with reporters, said he was now "just a supporter in retirement."
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, (for this) we will return.
The separation of powers is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, it's all to be brought back to normal operation and I believe that we will do it this time.
Because if not, we have a street criterion," said Lech Walesa.
“That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the elections, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-Błońska added.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of affairs in Poland,” the former president replied.
“We need to re-establish the foundation”
When asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The president said very well.
We need to re-establish the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the separation of powers does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and that everyone knows otherwise Poland will not move forward.”
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-final.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.

The Senate has decided on key bills
The Senate passed without amendments the bill on the disclosure of the property of families of the most important government officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the law on the property of families of civil servants – without amendments – and 14 were against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of the information given in the statement about the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The Act on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important government officials, the project of which was created in the chancellery of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The regulations assume that the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions will be obliged to include in the property statement information about the personal property of spouses, children and people in common life.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the bill on flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.
55 senators voted for the bill, 12 were against, four abstained.
According to the bill, every flight of the president will be a flight "performed in the official mission."
The president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “taken in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed”.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in the match for a bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's mentees closed Thursday's defeat to Slovenia 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went together with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they did training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the accounts of those present in the class, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not to just practice volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending it more together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he recounted.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed we would go back to that game.
We discussed this match with each other on the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for the defeat, I would point out the ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better in this respect than us," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the “White-Red” did not stand the stress of the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by loud and numerous audiences.
He admitted that the world champions could have put a bit of a smooth road to the semi-final.
“Perhaps if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analyzed this lesson faster and would have played later in the later stages of the tournament.
But it's just if," he stipulated.
Gogol hopes the anger of Thursday's defeat will be turned into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's something to fight about.
We recently won the ME medal in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and moved to Ljubljana to the semi-final.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player has been given a 16-week ban on starts and a fine of 25 thousand dollars – in a six-month suspension – for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds during recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the vices of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both penalties are withheld for six months – a trial period in which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been messing around for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record – he has had to pay the highest-ever single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to the court.
High-profile swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a losing match against Karen Khachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
He also did not play in the 2019 U.S. Open for long, but he was able to say publicly that the ATP activists “are corrupt”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
Words about corruption, however, were forgiven, after hearing the blamed and learning the context of the speech.
In the justification, however, the tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior for the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar way, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfilment of several conditions in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, he can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with judges and the audience, or any other way behave indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental coaches during tournaments and also in the off-season to consult with people specializing in solving problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios's first comment (on social media) for the verdict was this: "Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break anyway, because in the Laver Cup he suffered an injury of the shoulder, so he had to give up the upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: We are living better in Poland
According to the report published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office on household budgets, 44 percent of them assessed as a good or rather good financial situation last year.
A year earlier, that percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016. 33.5 percent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistics office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – never exceeded 30 percent.
He considered his material situation to be bad or rather bad in the last year. A total of 8.1 percent of households, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.
The best is the financial situation of self-employed households.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.
At the other pole are pensioners' households, where the percentage of such responses was just 18 percent.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also greatly influenced by the number of children.
The worst thing is for parents raising offspring alone, among whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and large families (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships, there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of household material conditions.
The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Next are the Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3 percent) and West Pomeranian (47.1%) voivodships.
Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94 percent last year. national average, and in Lubuskie 98 percent.
The highest income was held by the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 percent. national average) and Silesian (104 percent).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was in 2018. 1693 zł.
In real terms (after the correction for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3 percent compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this is a fairly low result.
In 2016, personal income increased by 7 per cent, and a year later by 6.3 per cent.
Although income growth is slowing down, it also inhibits spending growth.
Those per person amounted to last year. 1187 zł, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7 percent.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, spending per person increased by 1.9 percent in real terms and by 4.3 percent in 2016.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1 percent of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80 percent, and by 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

U.S.: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
Over the past two years, five crew members of the ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide occurred in July this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the incidents occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was docking off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded in the case.
In addition, deaths are not to be linked.
“It is necessary for everyone to engage in making suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigma or other repercussions related to the search for help," Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
Niesiołowski critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every sentence he said was accepted.”
Later, there was a criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk is laid a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best during the life of the Polish Pope,” he explained.
The former politician admitted: “there were squints of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or sent him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do this, and so did his successor," Niesiołowski explained.
“In addition, this fatal matter of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and in fact the absence of them, has come to this.
I ran out a little bit ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters," Niesiołowski said in an interview with a journalist.
In the opinion of the former politician of the Polish Church, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice Party.
“It must be acknowledged that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the regime in Pisa.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly," argued Niesiołowski.
“I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.

PZPN is punishing for brawls in stadiums.
Griffin disqualified
The clash within the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk by a small hair did not end tragically, when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović, fired by the fans from Wejherowo, passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team.
After that incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case punished Gryf with severe punishment, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match in their own stadium.
They will also not be allowed to leave for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzewa Łódź stadium was also caused by Silesian Wrocław fans.
Here, however, the PZPN ruling was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed the Łódź fans to be pelted with racia, set fire to chairs and push the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The ban on trips was also taken by the league matches of Ekstraklasa, but there it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the signage across the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In the Podkarpacie region, the implementation of the amendment to the Ministry of Infrastructure Regulation on m.in. the recording of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
E.g. "The Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv."
In our voivodship, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment to the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighboring countries often also have a Polish wording.
Thanks to the change prepared by us in the law, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.
The introduction of the new signage begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway,” said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In the Podkarpacie region, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand zł.
In the first place, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be done without replacing the boards, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the towns with new, written in Polish on the already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish, and then in the original, in brackets.
This will be a great convenience for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windbreaker
In the pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with problems with wings.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had set a target from the animal – a shotgun from a windbreaker was found in his body.
“Information about the injured bird was received from the inhabitants of the village of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sól.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
You could see immediately that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of the X-ray, it was already known that someone had made it a shooting shield.
There were shrapnel of shotgun in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, the company managing the m.in. rehabilitation center.
He's wintering in the center
“The wounds have been cleaned, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
For now, he's unable to fly.
To release it now would involve the fact that he would most likely not have survived the winter," adds Walasek.
Staff after undergoing a swan's rehabilitation intends to release him into the same pond in the spring.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal’s ill-health, the authorities of the municipality of Żukowice intend to inform the prosecutor’s office about the case.
The incident happened in Zameczno
Gowin: “we need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.
During the conversation in “Signals of the Day” on Radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is overrun by international networks, which impose so low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a “counter from the EC”.
“We won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will come back to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and thus small trade”.
“We will have to think about whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax was not allowed public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8 percent on revenue between 17 million zlotys and 170 million zlotys per month and 1.4 percent on revenue above 170 million zlotys per month.
The tax was expected to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the Commission initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax design could favor smaller stores, which could be considered public aid.
She then stated that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.
It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the tax to be re-introduced, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the CJEU's press service told PAP that the case is currently in a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will begin, i.e. hearing the parties and the possible hearing.
It takes a good few to several months from appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
"This is the case for an average of one year," a source at the Luxembourg Court told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We provide some practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion at which the whole family is centered around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world together.
No wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their child to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In the stores you can find many tuning sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks of toddlers were baptized, tuned into white sets and put into the same beetles or big pillows.
Today, children who come to the sacrament are often older: months, annual and even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a large child needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.
Therefore, if your child on the day of baptism is 3-4 months old, he will probably spend the ceremony in a stroller or on the hands of his parents or godparents.
The best solution will be to decorate it with comfortable, cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this element of clothing is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.
For the boy, the perfect body with the print of flies and suspenders will be perfect.
In the case of older children, you can afford a greater fantasy in clothing.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls look with longing towards richly decorated, frilly dresses for baptism complete with coats, wristbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look into the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and pants, stiff collars or caskets often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their displeasure.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, sweatpants shorts, and a blouse decorated on the front with a vest pattern.
These costumes look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrain the movements of the toddler who knows the world.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a property statement at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS MP accumulated 110 thousand zlotys of savings.
Pawłowicz announced her departure from politics.
At the end of the term of office, he has an amount of 110 thousand PLN
According to the statement made by the Member, she collects a pension with a monthly value of 4.7 thousand PLN.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth 570 thousand zlotys and slightly smaller, which he rents, taking 880 zlotys per month.

Earlier, the property statement was also published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Vote on break in deliberations during the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons deliberations for the duration of the Conservative Party's annual program conference, which the government has requested.
There were 289 MPs in favour, against 306.
Customarily, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign either from participating in them or from the meetings of parliament.
However, opposition parties have acknowledged that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt the deliberations.
The government's request for a break was made by 289 MPs, 306 were against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of permission for a break could be seen as the political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was ruled unlawful and non-existing) and for the fact that, after the judges' ruling, he did not want to apologize for it.
After that ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the following turbulent debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time to get Brexit done.
It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can address the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realised so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media captionAnder Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media write.
A spokesman for the president strongly denied the reports.
"This is simply not true," Błażej Spychalski tweeted.
Israeli media, m.in. “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, citing the “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York declared that it was Israel who was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles sucked up anti-Semitism with breast milk."
Andrzej Duda said that he regrets that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned an act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Pole, Pole."
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," Błażej Spychalski tweeted.
He stressed that Duda "has never said Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.
According to the “JI” interviewees, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that it was the Jews of Israel "like Israel Kac" who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources of the Boteach portal, Mosberg's statement was to be interrupted.
Who is Banaś and what is he guilty of?
The tenement house rented by the clipboners led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banaś's property statements.
We are summarizing another scandal that shocked the ruling camp.
The journalists of “Superwizjera” TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Audit Office, in recent years did not enter into the property statement of the 400-meter tenement house, which is located in the Podgórze district in Krakow.
Moreover, his sub-tenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (i.e. rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has allegedly been a security for repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the program "Superwizjer".
The journalist revealed that the tenement house was rented from Banas by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banaś responded to the allegations vaguely and murdly.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimeters led the journalist to discover the negligence in Banaś's property statements.
The tenement house itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
“The property of Marian Banaś and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]” writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting control of Marian Banaś’s property statements for the years 2015–2019.
Banaś announced that by the time it is completed, he will suspend his activities in NIK. “I will apply to the marshal for unpaid leave,” he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
“We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or speed up the examination of Marian Banaś’s property statements.
Therefore, we are forced to provide state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]” – said Mariusz Witczak, a PO-KO MP.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the policeman's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregard of the order for a particular behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
The introduction of such a change is wanted by police trade unionists.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million cases of wrongdoing go to Polish courts,” we read.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition, which the Independent Police Union writes to MPs on the amendment of the code of offences, has a chance to succeed.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of the article. 54a of the Code of Infractions.
It would read: "A person who does not submit to the demand or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be punishable by arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who, without following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of official activities," the journal reports.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, he can be used in political matters of manifestations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and instead of mitigating the situation, even to exacerbate it,” he adds.
Statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86 percent of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month the services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with Václav Havel.
Over Jáchym, therefore, from the beginning, there was a curse of talent, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with a "Sensitive Man."
The protagonists are Buras and Soňa along with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are wandering actors, traveling in Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other, time stopped in infant times.
But it's not the characters who are the most important in this story.
All are only the background to observe a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of a flotty province, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
The “sensitive man” sometimes turns into an absurd theatrics.
The narrative mimics the didascalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The scene is Europe full of fears for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Though British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
The company, however, has problems.
According to VRT television, Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy issues of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with the office, which have been booked in Belgium, will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently ok. 12 thousand. Belgians are abroad on trips bought from Thomas Cook.
Another 40 thousand people were to leave with the office by the end of the year.
As recently as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the British mother company's bankruptcy, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office was reassuring at the time that the customers who bought the tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the world's largest travel agencies - declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the 900 million pound rescue plan already agreed in August, the company earn an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have a lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in debt reaching 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for the review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the German visitors Görlitz.
The actions are to help fight the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists every year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with considerable problems.
In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54 thousand people.
Wanting to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.
Two-thirds of them were laid by residents of large cities.
The program was also of interest to people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project’s participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free housing, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the opinion of the participants in the program.
The information collected from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - about what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma.
