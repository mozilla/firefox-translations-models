This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but also provides details such as color and three-dimensional layout, which can't be obtained from fossils.
According to the researchers, the plumage of this animal was chestnut on top, and underneath it was bright or in carotene color.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the stack, but have different feather characteristics – rays and rays – the researchers have concluded that the stack was likely to be a later evolutionary stage than the other features.
The construction of feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for show. In the opinion of scientists, it is the plumage of an adult, not a chick, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.

Uka's gun, pointed at the head of a fifth man, failed. Schneider feels constant pain, can't see in one eye, lacks a piece of skull, and his face is rebuilt from titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via video conferences from the USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo took part in two individual races at the championship.
The first competition was a slalom in which she did not finish the first run. With the same result, 36 out of 116 riders finished the race.
The second race (slalom giant) finished in 10th place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41:30, which is 2:11:60 slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and at 1:09:02 slower than the ninth place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the group of sitting athletes did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 skiers participating in the giant slalom were not classified.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered a stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and we recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The defendants were identified as the following persons: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants stood trial with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit him, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe injuries to his head.
The road on which the accident happened was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was placed in the Hospital. James Paget at Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh district court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable because her image has been widely made public.
It's a common practice in other regions of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts believe the publication of photographs can be damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists are entering dangerous territory by posting pictures of suspects, etc.”
The Royal Bench Office, responsible to the general extent for conducting investigations, told reporters that any further comments would be withheld at least until the indictment was filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
According to reports, other topics discussed concern the future status of Jerusalem, the holy city for both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement has been signed, and the AP agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters as the test was monitored and subject to effectiveness assessment.
As part of the NPWS and the Australian Sports Rifle Association (NSW) partnership, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting programme of the Sports Rifle Association.
Mick O'Flynn, director of protection and heritage of the NPSW park, believes four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have been given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which includes nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to speed up new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Protests taking sometimes violent course have been the aftermath of a lack of elections, blocked in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods were reported malfunctioning due to overheating caused by six fires and four people were slightly burned.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it knew about the 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said Apple had notified 34 additional overheating incidents, describing them as "non-threatening."
As Apple postponed the release of the report, the ministry called the decision "very unfortunate."
The earthquake struck the Marian Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (that is, on Friday at 21:19 universal time).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office said the country had suffered no damage.
In addition, the Pacific tsunami warning center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A bus with tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Philippine police officer who took passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza directed the fire from the M16 rifle towards the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been saved and at least six have been declared dead.
Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Later, the photographers took the place of the old lady, needing a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his dad's footsteps and began his career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to begin his research into premature birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate the development of the lungs in the fetus.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators managed to recover the black boxes.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of two moons, which was as special as herself. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said that “Luna was as crazy as I was... and maybe more so...I love her and I will miss her... you can only express hope that she is better now.”
A survey of 1,400 people and the proportion of people opposed to the introduction of the republic's regime in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign before the 2010 election that Australia should turn into a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
In extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never be.
The Olympic gold medalist was to start in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but because he complained about his form, there were doubts about his expected results.
The medications necessary to combat pain were prohibited by the rules of the Games, so he could not take them.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By the beginning of February, several people had confirmed the discovery using other hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is assumed that comets supplied water to Earth with organic matter capable of creating proteins and maintaining life.
Scientists hope to learn about the process of planet formation, and especially how this process looked like in the case of Earth, because long ago comets collided with it.
Cuomo, 53, took over as governor earlier this year, and last month, ratified a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described these rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes, millions of gallons of fuel savings and reduce carbon emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older-generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transportation options, ground-line trains will not stand at Wembley, and in addition, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be inaccessible in ground space.
A potential lack of transport has likely scenarios that the match will take place behind closed doors without the participation of the team's supporters.
Published Thursday in Science magazine, the study reports the emergence of a new species of birds on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have announced that a new species has been formed in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer based on Darwin's finch reproduction, black darwinkas, cactus darwins and coarse darwins.
Gold can be processed into different shapes, even the smallest.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. They can be patted or rolled into sheets.
They can be thinly pressed and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "Illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH indicator of a chemical. Red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter “H” for short “pH”) contained in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of electrons (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then squeeze them with clean wet hands, forming a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there was a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a modern sewer.
In houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, the remains of a sewer system have been discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths, where men and women stayed together.
When you call a person who's thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The connection goes to the satellite in space, after which it almost immediately bounces it back,
The satellite launched a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes placed in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and thus the image visible from Earth.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket with a height of more than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways. First of all, it enabled us to transport much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no railways, cars and many other modes of transport.
Lower are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes up to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat up many more small prey, e.g. insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, in a special task that every cat performs, so it cannot compete with others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in herds with high numbers.
The flock of lions consists of one, two or three related adult males and as many as thirty females and young.
The females are mostly closely related, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions exhibit behavior similar to a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in terms of the behavior and deadly danger they pose to their victims.
The tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump over considerable distances and pull five times better than a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard and jaguar, belongs to the genus Panthera. Only these four species of cats can roar.
The rike of a tiger is not as loud as a lion, but rather like entangled, shouted words.
Ocelots like small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of the victims of the ocelot are much smaller in size than himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (for food) after smelling.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their ability to see at night and move stealthily. They hunt their victims, blending into their surroundings, then throwing themselves at the prey.
In the case of separation of a small group of living (a small population) from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, without the possibility of easy withdrawal) they are often in a different environment than before.
There are different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so the new population will have to develop new properties or adapt in such a way as to be able to compete effectively in a new environment for itself.
The original population has not changed a little and still needs to adapt the same way.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, they look less and less like other populations.
In the end, when thousands or even millions of years have passed, these two populations will differ to such an extent that it will be difficult to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. The specialization is an inevitable result of evolution and its very important element.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e., they exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients. Plants also give shade.
We make our homes from plants, just like our clothes. Most of our food is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the biggest predator at the time, so he feared only other mosasaurs.
In the elongated jaws, he had more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and the extra teeth protruded from the palate, so in contact with him, the victims had no chance.
He's not entirely sure, but he may have had his tongue forked. He fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, he could even be a cannibal.
He didn't retreat from attacking the victims in the water and even such a huge dinosaur as T. rex must have felt respect for him.
Although we know well most of the dishes that the Romans consumed, their feasts also featured quite exotic dishes, e.g. wild boar, peacock, snails and souls.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate meals while sitting on stools, and the rich met at banquets, during which they ate in a reclining position.
The dishes in ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that made their way to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't know, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
In Babylon, each of the deities had a temple dedicated to itself, which was considered to be his home.
The sacrifices for the deities were brought by the people, and the role of the priests was to take care of divine needs through celebrations and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which there was an internal sanctuary, accessible exclusively to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were erected, called zigurats, which became part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to God was at the top of the tower.
The house did not play a particularly important role in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was on the air.
The women prepared food in the yards, the shops were ordinary countertops coming out into the street. Stones were used to build houses.
Since there were no large forests in the area of Kanaan, the prices of wood were very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Nordic sagas, Eryk Rudy was driven from Iceland for committing murder, and during a trip to the west, he discovered Greenland and called it Greenland.
However, without diminishing its role as an explorer, it should be noted that at that time the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting this area.
Although each country could be described as “Scandinavian”, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland differ from each other when it comes to peoples, rulers, customs and history.
If you have watched the movie “Treasure of Nations”, you may think that a map with a road to the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. There are some records on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure-leading map.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence were written: “The Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776”. The inscription is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote this, but it is known that at first this large parchment document (29.75 by 24.5 inches) was driven for storage.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the annotation has been added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and further clashes led to the liberation of the northern part of France, but the south was still under occupation.
French “Vichy” had power on this. These were people from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and cooperated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of the south of France, which was called Operation Dragoon.
It only took two weeks for the U.S. and Free France forces to liberate southern France and head for Germany.
Civilization is one culture, common to a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civic," a related word for "civis," meaning "civital," and "civitas," or a city-state, which in a way also indicates the size of the community.
The city-states were prototypes of nations. The culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge through many generations, the imprinting of a lasting cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind a vital historical testimony, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first established a fragile central government – the only element of which was Congress – based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it was based on state authorities, which often showed no willingness to cooperate in enforcing all of its bills.
In addition, he did not have the authority to repeal the rules and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all states before any changes were made, while the states referred to the central government with such disregard that their representatives often did not appear.
Alongside the German team, the Italian national football team is second in the world football rankings, and in 2006 won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and athletes from Italy participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/groups of islands it has, Japan is often called the “archipelago” in the geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when the passing European sailors wrote the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means a beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company founded factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to implement changes in the indigenous practices of grain production and hired Chinese to work on rice and cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty troops (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, failing in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed a treaty with Shimonoseki, handing Taiwan to Japan, which will rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, there are three basic objects: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better illustrate the original appearance of this place to visitors to tourists, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt.
By 1976, a third of the city of Machu Picchu had been restored and the process was still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, i.e. the most common size of film tape at the end of the era of analogue films.
It is still being produced today, but more important is that this image format has been moved to matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite confusing.
The ratio for this format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest total ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group) are the same or significantly resemble this proportion factor.
The tri-division rule is often overused or ridiculed, but it is a simple guideline to help achieve the effect of dynamism without disorder of order.
It states that the ideal place for the main object is the intersection point of the lines dividing the photo into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was powerful and wealthy, came under careful observation.
For more than one millennium, the Christian religion has provided an important bond between European countries with different language and customs.
His power was so all-encompassing that it affected everyone, starting with the king and ending with the peasant.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity says that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor and that church funds are to be used for this purpose.
The main church authority has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money makes it ask itself whether this doctrine is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain introduced Germany's naval blockade.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements concluded in the previous two centuries.
Britain has mined areas of international waters to block ships' access to huge parts of the ocean, making even neutral vessels vulnerable.
This tactic was met with a limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation in the case of their unpardoned underwater war operations.
The 1920s are characterized by the attitude of pacifism and the isolation of most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because of his work at Edison in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were shown in a unique way; each stage in China or every family in power constituted a separate dynasty.
In transitional periods of infinity, between the reign of successive dynasties, the provinces plunged into confusion and division. The Three Kingdoms era covering 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty is the most famous such period.
Many of the notables pretending to the throne clashed with each other in fierce battles during those periods.
The era of the Three Kingdoms has been recorded in the history of ancient China as a period of great bloodshed; thousands of people have died fighting for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, e.g. the application of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, and not only to the single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, all male candidates had free access to the professions, thanks to which success could be achieved by those who showed the greatest ambition and turnover.
The same applies to the military, because the rankings of the army formerly based on classes are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many repressed people from the working class in other countries to begin the revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond his ordinary life. He often went to a cave known as “Hira” on the top of “Noor” (the mountain of light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful idea of Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It’s not easy to find it, even when you know it exists. In the interior of the cave, the visitor will have absolute isolation.
You can see nothing but a clean, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave you can not see or hear too much of the outside world.
The only one of the seven wonders of the world preserved to this day is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of the late Pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau (also called the Giza necropolis) in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead there are several pyramids (the largest of them is the Cheops pyramid), several tombs of smaller size, several temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives and relatives of Cheops.
The symbol “upstrand” looks like the letter “V” and the symbol “downstring” – like a clip or square without the lower side.
Up means that you should start with the tip and press the string, and down means that you should start with the frog (this is the place where the hand holds the string) and pull the string.
The movement of the bow from the bottom to the top generates a softer sound, and the string from the top to the bottom provokes a stronger, more forceful sound.
Don’t worry, draw your own characters, but remember that the printed signs on the string are there for musical reasons, so you should usually stick to them.
The crowd of infused bribes forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antonina, their two children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
When the king and queen returned to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a spoiling crowd of threats at them.
An angry mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person from the crowd waved the head of a guard killed in Versailles just before the terrified queen.
The wartime spending of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines was covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of spending and interest on bonds put on the stock market on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking homes.
Of course, the great gains made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary gains of the imperialism of the United States.
The context in which the Templar Order was created is essential in understanding its specificity.
These events belong to an era commonly called the late Middle Ages, which included the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in the history of Europe (1000–1300 CE).
Before the Middle Middle Ages, there was an early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism includes a wide range of ideas used in practice, including technological impulse or technological imperatives, as well as the strict definition of the human destiny guided by the hidden logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general principles: firstly, the process of technology development itself is not subject to the influence of cultural or political factors, and secondly, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of a road network.
Since the national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce the vehicle's operating costs.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, and thus – to the invention in medicine of new ways of repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the individual was shaped by geography, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography were developed, so consistent with the place of society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is famous today as the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was once considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame as a decent of luxury began around the year 400 AD and survived until the year 1000 CE.
His status declined in the 12th century, primarily because the returning Crusades brought goods such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what was offered at the Byzantine fair.
That's when the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its optimum in the X-XI and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, since the exchange of information was slowly taking place, Western styles could develop late by 25–30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style. One of the greatest prey of that time, which was the consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Agriculture for its own needs is that a farmer produces enough food to meet the needs of him and his family.
Self-providing agriculture is a simple, often organic system using self-sowing from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximizing efficiency.
In the past, most farmers have met only their own needs and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures attract people with a similar attitude to the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures are different in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The distinguishing features of the subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or may constitute a combination of various factors.
If someone is a member of the subculture, it shows it through a distinct and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to base on a few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during adolescence – whether due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Such children are referred to as “wild” or “feral.” Some were imprisoned (usually by parents) and some were abandoned because parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Before abandoning or running, feral children may have suffered trauma or abuse.
It is assumed that others have raised animals, and some supposedly live in the wild on their own.
If only animals take care of a feral child, it behaves almost completely (taking into account physical limitations) just like these animals, manifesting fear or indifference to people.
The method of projects should facilitate and make learning more attractive, while scaffolding learning goes a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to people who participate in new learning experiences, e.g. they use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, i.e. the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinacz in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain procedures that the student’s self-understanding can be challenging.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, such as neglect, exploitation and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide him with upbringing, care and education, but unfortunately that happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet all the needs that were not met in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific properties of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of usage and approach to gratification.
For example, “science” and “contacts with others” are proposed as valid reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal engagement” and “permanent relationships” were also referred to by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have allowed for significant findings in the interpretation of microexpression, i.e. facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly reading its microexpressions.
In an article titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks argues that people who, as a result of brain damage, do not understand speech, are nevertheless able to properly assess the honesty of the speaker.
It even suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior can also have animals, such as domestic dogs.
Scientific research conducted over the 20th century shows that there are two pools of genetic variation – one hidden and the other expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing on the savannah with difficulty allow primates with a digestive system such as in humans to meet the body's demand for amino acids.
Moreover, abandoning this can have serious consequences: stopping growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and pods, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest without first cooking.
It is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs) that is easy to digest and provides large amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking into account everything, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a similar way, as the chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep cessation involves intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after 10 to 60 minutes.
It is not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness, but does not wake up completely.
If you find that you are rearranging the clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythmia-based methods recommend consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea that is diuretic) before falling asleep to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the internal and physical tension of the person.
The less stress, the more positive the life force is. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. Only our own tension and negative approach stand in the way.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but additionally includes the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga makes the energy of the kundalini (i.e. the energy of enlightenment) awaken through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Thanks to the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightenment awareness is created.
During World War II, the U.S. and the USR allied themselves against the common enemy, which was Germany. However, when the war came to an end, the radical clash of systems, processes and cultures diverged the two countries.
Two years have passed since the end of the war, when the previous allies became enemies, which gave rise to the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for another 40 years and include real fighting fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, with the sole hope of retreat and reorganization along the Romanian foothold.
However, these plans quickly lost their relevance when more than 800 thousand of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern Poland, thus breaking the provisions of the Riga peace, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to provide the country with the opportunity to transport people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most prominent examples in recent history. To help the British, the Americans attempted to move people and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, using primarily submarines, tried to block these metastases.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have conquered the UK, as would the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably occurred in the Iranian mountains of Zagros about 10 000 years ago.
People belonging to ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them because of their milk, bristles, meat and skin.
Goats were usually kept in herds that wandered the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat groves, which were usually children or teenagers. These breeding methods are still being used.
Railway tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built only in parallel wooden boards, train horses could move around them faster and transport larger loads than on the bumpy roads of the time.
The railway sleepers on which the rails were attached appeared relatively early. However, it was gradually understood that in order to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips should be mounted on them.
This has become a popular practice, but iron has contributed to the greater wear of wagon wheels made of wood.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, rails produced entirely from iron were introduced.
The first known way of moving was walking; man began to walk in a vertical position two million years ago, and hence the term Homo Erectus (an upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecas, were not in the habit of walking upright.
Forms of bipedality can be found in the fossils of australopithecs dating back to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelantrop moved on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to some extent to contribute to reducing the scale of suffering in the future.
This is often like symptomatic treatment. However, in order not to be limited to a temporary solution, it is necessary to identify the source of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technical advances, and due to overcrowding and extravagant lifestyle, the problems have exacerbated.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, its handwritten version signed by John Hancock, Congressional President, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few streets away.
At night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, today known as “Dunlap broadsides.”
The documentary was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall building on July 8.
One of them on July 6 was sent to George Washington, who instructed to read it to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 still existing Dunlap tubers are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The handwritten original did not survive.
Many paleontologists say that one group of dinosaurs survived until today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in the birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, just like the T-Rex.
Virtually all currently used computers are based on the manipulation of information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can be 0 or 1 and this type of number is referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not have to come out immediately. Such symptoms as vomiting are general enough that they do not give grounds for immediate diagnosis.
The poisoning is best indicated by the presence of an open package with drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Read the instructions on the label to learn how to provide first aid for this particular poisoning.
The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term dates back to ancient times, which were not strangers to bed bugs, which are highly adapted to human parasitization.
Both snagged bed bugs and bed bugs are nesters, adapted to life in the nest or in the host house.
About 400 000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered in the United States, making them the most common neurological disease among adults in the young and middle age range.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
According to the results of the study, the risk of multiple sclerosis is twice as high in women as in men.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest or in the interest of the child.
These couples can make the decision to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
The adoption is that biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The overarching goal of science is to discover the mechanism of the world’s operation using the scientific method. Most scientific studies are based on this method.
However, this is not the only method; the experiment is a test that allows you to reject one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also give direction to scientific research.
The classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin translation, formed the basis of studies conducted by naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle’s views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were adopted.
Because the knowledge of the Greek language was diminishing, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their formation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that last throughout cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted, in one, marking the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus, and in the other, marking the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, on the importance of the element of the genetic material concerned and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting Borneo, photographing and getting information about orangutans.
Every morning people leave their small towns by car and go to work, on the way they pass those who go to the places from which they have just left.
As part of this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone somehow participates in a transport system based on private vehicles and supports this system.
Currently, science indicates that a huge coal economy has driven the biosphere out of its permanent state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a participant in social life and uses transport. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapse are rarely heard.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there any irregularities in their functioning every day? Are the engineers responsible for them ordinary squirmers? Or maybe the problem is much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty, so unfortunately the study of traffic flow poses difficulties.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is within a fundamentally coherent range; therefore, traffic streams also show some consistency and can be presented approximately with mathematical calculations.
The compounds occurring between the three key properties, i.e. (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, allow better imagery of traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road objects use this kind of relationship.
Insects were the first animals to soar into the air. The ability to fly has allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have a useful ability to fold wings along the torso.
Thanks to this, they have a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects without the ability to fold wings include dragonflies and whims.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Arystarch stated that the solar system orbits the Sun.
There were those who thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, i.e. that the solar system, and with it the Sun and other stars, orbits the Earth.
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second largest in length, and at the same time the largest river in the world. It transfers 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of close to 6 miles.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of the waters from the ocean-feeding rivers on Earth.
The Amazon in its main run is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and is powered by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old State period, it never succeeded in surpassing the size and technical perfection of the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians from the New State period looked with admiration at the buildings of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican population is OK. 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the least population.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Most people working in this country speak Italian on a daily basis, and Latin can often be heard during religious celebrations.
All the people of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Already in ancient times, people knew the basic chemical elements, e.g. gold, silver and copper, because they are present in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything is a combination of at least one to four elements. They were: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of concentration of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also made theories about their transformation into new substances that shape what we see.
The alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals. It should be remembered that the periodic table contains a lot of elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements considered metals. Of course, metals also include silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. The matter is formed by tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so unimaginably microscopic that the dot at the end of this task would accommodate their trillions.
So when the pencil came out, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing pencils, it has lost its status and frequency of application.
People are now writing messages, using computer screens, and they don't need sharpeners at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The atomic bomb operates according to the principle that it takes energy to connect the nucleus to multiple protons and neurons.
It's like turning a heavy cart uphill. The fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with or even without a small hit-and-run.
The surface of the moon is covered by rocks and dust. The outer layer of the planet is called the shell.
The cover is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km further.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the visible side there may be more areas of the maria, because the thickness of the shell is smaller here and the lava has easier to break into the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what responds to people and speaks to them.
These theories assume that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been absorbed in the process of maturation into adulthood.
These theories relate to what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and others don't.
Two popular theories of content are the pyramid of needs of Maslov and the two-factor theory of Hertzberg.
Generally speaking, when executives start leading their former colleagues, there may be two types of behavior. One is to try to remain “one of the teams” (or one).
This kind of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions and avoids performance assessment, assignment of tasks, and accounting for people from the work they have done.
The second extreme is to unrecognizably transform into someone who feels he has to change everything the team has done so far, subduing his own vision.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often results in frictions between leaders and other team members.
For virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for a directly related physical group.
They often have more freedom than ordinary team members, because their teams can hold meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of the virtual team.
“Invisible Group” is the management team to which all members are subject. An invisible group sets standards for every member.
For what reason would the company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of the organization.
As a result, cooperation within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to the creation of an innovative process that will meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to become innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains Continuum’s approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of action.
Neurobiological data are physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This narrows the research area and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and the procedure is supported by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries and tumors have an impact on behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
Thanks to new technologies, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes in it.
We draw a lot of information and materials from here to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what is happening in the human mind.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly linked to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent machine adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples are: control and planning, the ability to answer customer statements and questions, as well as recognition of the nature of writing, voice and face.
These things have become separate areas, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used today in areas such as economics, medicine, engineering and military technology, and also occurs as a built-in element in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of any activity. It is often the case that a teacher would be happy to take her students to places where buses do not reach.
The technology gives you the opportunity for virtual field trips. Students can see museum collections, visit an aquarium or admire works of art while sitting in their room.
By providing a field trip in virtual mode, you can stimulate reflections on it and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the site is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students make progress in writing. Often at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling are not at the highest level, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Blogger begins to make efforts to improve the quality of his texts and avoid criticism, as students often offer the strictest grades.
In addition, blogging “makes students get to know the world around them better.” The need to respond to the audience’s interests inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Thanks to the proper use of blogs, “pupils can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online entries, they can define their position in relation to the creativity of other people and outline their own perspective on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums, showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south of here is the Niagara waterfall, and in the north you can discover the unspoilt beauty of the Muskok district and the surrounding regions.
All of these things – and more – clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessential Canada.
Extensive areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are virtually depopulated wilderness.
This comparison of the population surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean in the east of the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and because of nature it is a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or allied nations with France and are famous as luxury seaside holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was strongly received in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European outflows and colonialism emerged in the 15th century when Portuguese traveller Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
From the north, the region is adjacent to the Sahel, and from the south and west it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that every woman on the go to pretend to be married regardless of her true marital status.
It also helps to put on a ring (as long as it does not look too expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can cause behaviors they consider to be harassment, can often be tracked, grasped by hands, etc.
Definitely refuse men and do not be afraid to bet on your own (cultural differences do not mean that it can be!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidom as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned them after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had commercial bases there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is in last place in all of Morocco.
Within the old Medina you can easily buy traditional Moroccan goods, e.g. tajin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole lot of different trinkets, but this is an offer designed typically for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern end of the state close to the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is quite safe, all visits outside of her area should have been investigated in advance for the state of the fighting, taking place in the province of North Kivu.
From the city you can go for a climb to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as to track down mountain gorillas, which is one of the cheapest options for this attraction in Africa.
You can use motorcycle taxis (so-called boda-boda) to move around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short course will mow approx. 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively difficult available location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and there is an airport there.
In 1990, the city was included in the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the damage caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' special show on PBS television's "The Wonders of the African World."
This city is definitely different from the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering the east with Mozambique, in the north of Zimbabwe, and the southern border is marked by the Crocodile River.
The area of the park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, characterized by different flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of South Africa National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for daily protection and access to the park, as in all other South African national parks.
The purchase of a wild card can be beneficial, as it allows access to selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the most important attraction for many tourists.
The compact ranks of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a glossy bar chart highlighted by the Victoria Bay pane.
The best views of Hong Kong are offered by the Koulun waterfront opposite the city.
The large majority of the Hong Kong island's urban buildings are compacted on land after reclamation along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so here it is worth starting to search for traces of the colonial past of this territory.
Sundarbany is the world's largest mangrove forest strip, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast deep into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbany was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest located on the territory of India is called the Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not only mangroven quakes – they are also the last remains of huge jungles that once covered the Hindustan Lowland.
Sundarbans have an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third are covered with water and urine.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve and it is assumed that now 400 royal Bengal tigers live there and about 30 000 read.
Buses leave from the interregional bus station (across the river) all day long, although most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
It is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because buses running between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese waterfront buses, comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transport to places nearby, e.g. Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspended bridge that enables communication between the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not put into service until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be able to be put into use in September 2017, when the construction of Brazilian customs posts is expected to be completed.
The Guarans were the most important group of indigenous people in the region of today's eastern Paraguay, the life-leading half-nomadic hunters and hard-working agriculture to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was the homeland of other indigenous tribes, e.g. Guaycurú and Payaguá, which survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "great province of India," was formed in the 16th century as a result of a clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish gave rise to a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537. Paraguay managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held on the polo pitches in Las Cañitas.
In other months, you can also find tournaments and competitions organized on a smaller scale.
The Association of Asociacion Argentina de Polo offers more information about competitions and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), worth equal to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Payments in British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards can be used in Stanley, and in addition, you can also pay in US dollars.
It is not to count on card payment, staying on the farthest islands, although British and American currencies can be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance about the form of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer reigns there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be more cold than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but combined with wind and moisture, the feeling of coolness is greater than the thermometer shows.
There are no “dry” and “rainy” times, the amount of rainfall is actually the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing people, they are still wild, so they must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend that you keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all the other wild animals!
Although they may look mild, bison, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they do not maintain an adequate distance. These are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant dishes and keep the encampment clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and inhabited by less than 40 thousand people.
For the 50's. The 19th century marks the time of the founding of the city of Apia, which became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous naval deadlock occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of the main leader of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are quite a few beaches here, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the northern waterfront (in the North Harbour district) are over the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and on most of the shade are guaranteed by metrosideros trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in downtown Auckland.
They are, often crowded, family beaches with a wide selection of shops filling the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One”, which is not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is “Manta.”
It is worth stocking up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can better endure the journey.
You can drink tap water without any worries, but if you have doubts, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians are foreign to the concept of "flat white" coffee. Small black is an “espresso”, the cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices cost a lot, but they are excellent.
A lot of expeditions to the reef take place in a year-round mode, and injuries on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, follow all the signs and pay a lot of attention to safety warnings.
The ankles are found near beaches and rivers escape from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can also be found outside of this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but they are rarely attacking people. Most of these creatures feel fear in contact with man and drift away.
Rosary crocodiles do not lead active life in the oceans, their basic living environment is the mouth of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance means that the traveler does not have to worry whether he will have somewhere to sleep when reaching his destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book with a travel agent another form of accommodation, e.g. camping.
Travel agency offers include packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transportation, as well as connecting packages for the flight and hotel.
The reservation may be extended for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents needed at the destination (e.g. visas).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the spot, most of them believe that this is an integral part of this experience.
If you would like to be near the action, you need to come early to find a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even when the musical performances on the main stages are over, in some festival sectors the music will resound until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping spots designed for families with young children.
Crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the journey through the ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers of cruise ships do not have a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos usually strive to keep their guests as long as possible and leave as much money as possible. Hence the lack of windows and clocks, and the exit is difficult to find.
They usually have special offers that include meals, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them at home.
Some locals offer alcoholic beverages at the company's expense, but intoxication disrupts judgment and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When moving a vehicle at high latitudes or mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice and temperatures below zero should be taken into account.
There is little friction on the roads covered with ice and snow, so you can't drive like you do on clean asphalt.
When a snowstorm rages, it can quickly invade so much snow that the road becomes impassable.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or drops or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries where traffic is carried out without major obstacles throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land travels made to admire the beautiful African nature, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow adequate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be skittish, so it's better to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari (“walk in the bush”) can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and run until September 5, 2012. Some events will be hosted by other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia, hosting the summer Olympics twice (the first time it was in 1964).
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the change of date, you may be in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but by the end of March, most appeals from the coronavirus do not include July 2020, when the Olympics were to be held.
As expected, the prices of most tickets for events will range from 2500 yen to 130 000 yen, while the typical ticket price will be about 7000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of damp clothes. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not equipped with a room.
If there is no iron or you do not care about wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
The fabric must not be subject to excessive heating, as it can shrink or burn in extreme cases.
Water can be purified in many ways, and some of them more effectively combat certain threats.
Depending on the area, it is enough to boil water for a minute or you need a few minutes.
Filters have different efficiency, so if you have concerns, consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pest-owned animals that are not found in their native pages.
Pests destroy food, cause irritation or, in a worse case, allergic reactions, secrete venom and transmit infections.
Usually, the category of pests does not include infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people.
Free shopping gives you the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duty in certain places.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult section for drivers lies between Point Marion and Fairmont, often cutting through secluded forest areas.
If you are not in the habit of driving on rural roads, keep your eyes around your head, because you will often encounter steep driveways, narrow sections and sharp turns.
The marked speed limits are much lower than those in force on earlier and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph, or 56–64 km/h), and their strict adherence is extremely important.
However, it is interesting that the mobile network here has a much stronger signal than on many other sections of this route, e.g. in the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and the Bavarian ones are distinguished by their food and diversity, as in Austria, adjacent to Bavaria from the south side.
Fruit pastries are very popular: with cooked apples available all year round, and with cherries and plums in the summer.

Because there are as many as 17 000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine includes a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
The term, without additional precise terms, usually means the cuisine typical of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now easily accessible throughout the archipelago, includes simple seasoned dishes, and Java's favorite toppings include peanuts, chilli peppers and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is the foot supports of the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot being stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off a horse and his foot is stuck in a stirrup, the runaway horse can pull him. Various security measures can be taken to minimize the risk of such an event.
First of all, most jockeys wear horse riding shoes with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Then some saddles, in particular English, are equipped with protections that cause the flush to fall off the saddle if they are pulled by a rear-facing rider.
The Cochamó Valley is the most important climbing location in Chile, called the Yosemite of South America and offering a variety of large granite walls and turns.
There are spectacular views from the summits. Climbers from all over the globe are still setting new trails among the walls giving countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing or snowboarding are popular sports, which consist in descending on a snowy terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity on trips for many enthusiasts, sometimes called “skiing lunatics” who plan a whole holiday skiing in a given place.
Skiing has a very long history – already 5000 years BC on the walls of caves were painted silhouettes of skiers!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia. 
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or skiing.
You can see some similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, but unlike them, the route does not run through a steep terrain and you do not need more solid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than during the hike on foot, but only in rare cases you will reach the speeds of the run, provided that you are without a heavy backpack, and the route will be properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean the need to apply for multiple visas and multiple passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to submit a separate visa application to each Schengen member state, which saves time and money and reduces formalities.
There is no single universal definition, which human creations should be considered antiques. Some tax agencies treat as antiques any items more than 100 years old.
This definition depends on the geographical location, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be called antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Saams live off reindeer breeding, and the culture associated with this industry is also important for people doing other professions.
The traditional occupation that the Saams have and still have is not only the breeding of reindeer on a large scale, but also fishing, hunting, etc., with reindeer serving mainly as train animals.
Today, many Saams work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important branch of the economy in Lapland, which is inhabited by the Saams.

When planning a trip to a country considered a war zone, you need to undergo professional training.
When searching on the Internet for the slogan “Course on the hostile environment”, you will probably find the address of the local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, much more in detail and in conjunction with practice.
Usually, the course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and its scope includes exercises based on role-playing, a lot of first aid classes, and sometimes also training on the use of weapons.
Numerous books and magazines on the art of survival are widely available, while there are very few publications on war zones.
People who plan a gender reassignment operation abroad must have important documents for their return travel with them.
Governments respond differently to issuing passports without specifying gender (X) or updating names and genders in documents according to the wishes of interested parties.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is equally diverse.
In addition, after September 11, 2001, security security guards began conducting much more stringent searches.
Before surgery, transgender people should not expect that during scans their privacy and dignity will not be compromised.
Plane currents are created by waves breaking down on a beach, reef or similar barrier.
Underwater topology means that the return flow takes place mainly on several deeper levels and can be shaped there by a fast current directed to deep waters.
Most often, death occurs due to fatigue, which is caused by an attempt to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
As soon as you manage to get out of the current, getting back shouldn't be harder than normal.
Try to head to a place where you won't get into the power again, or wait for the rescue, taking into account your skills and whether someone noticed you.
The return shock comes faster than the culture shock (the time of the “honeymoon” is shorter), it lasts longer and can have more serious effects.
Tourists who have easily adapted to the new culture, sometimes with exceptional difficulty adapt again to their native culture.
Returning home after a period of living abroad, you are used to a new culture and have disposed of some of the habits associated with your national culture.
During your first trips abroad, people probably treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that a traveler coming to a foreign country must adapt.
People often do not anticipate that travelers returning home must also show patience and understanding.
The presentation of light and sound on the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for kids from the area.
You can watch the pyramids after dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and vendors can be heard here all the time. The story told by sound and light is like a booklet with fairy tales.
The Sphinx acts as the background and narrator of a long history.
On the pyramids, scenes are displayed and various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819. Southern Shetlands are the subject of claims of several countries and have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen operated in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, has the largest area of all.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deceptive Island, where the water-filled caldera of the still active volcano creates a picturesque natural bay.
Ellsworth's land is located north of the Peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here into a plateau, after which they re-emerge, forming a 360-kilometre chain of the Ellsworth mountains, half-haved Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range there are the highest mountains of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, and the highest peak reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot be a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to go outside and have good satellite visibility to connect.
The service is often used in shipping, also recreational vessels and during expeditions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telecommunications provider should provide more information about this service.
Among those planning a one-year break, travel and learning options are becoming more and more popular.

Often, participation in a one-year course abroad can significantly improve the chances of gaining higher education in your home country.
For enrolling in these educational programs, you usually charge a tuition fee.
Finland offers ideal conditions for relaxing on a boat. This “land of a thousand lakes” also abounds in islands, thousands of which are on lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
Although coastal archipelagos and the most extensive lakes are large enough for all yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak provide different experiences.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, the boat has one in seven or eight people.
A similar statistical indicator is true of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but this is still a unique result compared to countries such as the Netherlands, where one boat is forty citizens.
The extended stay in St. Petersburg is included in the program of most Baltic cruises.
That means you can explore the historic city for a few days, and get back on the ship overnight.
If you go down to shore only during boat trips, you do not need to have a separate visa (the situation for 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin on the tour program. The above map clearly shows that Berlin is not located by the sea or near it, so a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrible experience for people of all ages, especially if they have not flown before or have a traumatic event behind them.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and antipathies typical of many people.
Some are able to overcome the fear of the unknown or the lack of control if they learn the rules of operation of the aircraft and the mechanisms associated with the flight.
Courier companies make good money from fast deliveries. Often, time plays a key role when it comes to business documentation or the goods or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their aircraft, but this was problematic for other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent parcels by air, it could take days on some routes to unload and customs clearance.
The only way to send it faster is to give it as checked baggage. According to the airline regulations, you can not send luggage without a passenger, and this is the task for you.
The most obvious way to fly in the first or business class is to spend a lot of money for this privilege (or – even better – to get the company to do it for you).
However, this is an expensive option: in general, for a ticket in business class, we will pay four times more for a standard economy class, and for the first class as much as eleven times more!
In general, it is not worth wasting time looking for discounts for places in business class or first class when it comes to direct flights from point A to point B.
The airline is well aware that there is a regular group of travelers who will be happy to pay any amount to arrive quickly and conveniently, and take this into account when setting prices.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, where the local language is Romanian, although it is also Russian in its common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic experiencing ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the emergence of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic of Moldova in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the UN member states do not recognize it.
Despite the failed political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, its population is about 3.7 million, it is also the second largest port, immediately after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.

There you will find rare species of animals, e.g. a European bear, a wolf, an eagle, an owl, a lynx, a frost and a deaf, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have their knees and shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, inadequately dressed women get a scarf, but it is worth having your own, and especially brightly colored, to see the smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance to the temple.
Men are also required to wear knee-covering pants.
Men can also rent at the entrance headscarves covering their knees, but they are not washed on an ongoing basis, so not everyone will feel comfortable wearing such a scarf. For men one universal size!
The basis of cuisine in Majorca, as in other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.

All nouns are written in capital letters, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence, including the word “Sie”, i.e. a courtesy phrase meaning “Mr./Mr./State”.
This is an important method to distinguish some judgments from completion.
It can also be considered that this facilitates reading, although when writing, difficulties arise, because it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a noun form.

Because light pollution in its heyday was not a problem as it is now, they are usually found in cities or campuses, more readily available than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge devices located in remote locations where favorable weather conditions prevail.
The custom of contemplating cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been an element of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where plum flowers were the most popular.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first receptions of cherry blossoms exclusively for himself and other aristocrats from the imperial court.

Christmas, commemorating the coming of Jesus into the world, is one of the most important Christian holidays.
Also, non-believers in Christian countries and people of another religion around the world have incarnated many traditions in their lives that have grown up this Christmas.
According to a certain tradition, Easter night is spent, watching in an outdoor place and waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it might as well be the pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Churches with a more traditional approach celebrate the liturgy of the Easter Vigil in the evening on Holy Saturday, and the faithful often begin to celebrate the resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
All the animals that were on the island first came here, flew or arrived, floating on the water.
The distance from the continent was so large that the mammals were unable to get there, making the giant turtle a basic species living on the Galapagos.
As soon as a man arrived in the Galapagos, numerous mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience a polar night during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
