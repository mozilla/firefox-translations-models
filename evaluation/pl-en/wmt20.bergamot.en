Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He is a charismatic.
For the Holy Masses for release and healing, crowds are brought to the crowds.
He was a dozen years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
For a swamped by o. Witko Masses for release and healing bring crowds
Once, it was attended by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Astonished doctors said, “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the carciner’s hole disappeared completely.
The clergyman of the extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In dreams came to him purgatory souls asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to the man who committed mortal sin.
“My body has begun to change.
I lost human qualities and started to take on the appearance of the animal,” he says.
The invisible force lifted it up, he could not bring out his voice.
He felt he was lost.
God showed him the salvation.
“Injected in the waters of the river symbolizing the holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form,” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he didn’t just talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people take part in the masses for the healing of Witko celebrated by Father Witko, who count on getting rid of the disease.
However, the priest emphasizes that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) afternoon, the Kolping FRAC team deserved the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Stole Superliga.
In such a personal ranking, which they presented with the forefathers, Jarosławians have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
This was clearly shown by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called to the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the Yaroslavl team would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such cases as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at ul. Sikorski in Jarosław.
Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for itself.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting five-set battle – Pavla Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Leah a chance.
You could still have hoped to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why is that?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski’s announcements, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 years was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and its Subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
“The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing the NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive result of research,” it said.
The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have predicted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“I can hardly imagine that expert specialists say: Let’s not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state,” the politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements so far
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that it would break any agreements concluded with Israel if the country’s future government attempted to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will arise, will proceed to the implementation of this plan, we will annul all the agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas threatened with pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means – insignificant what the consequences will be – engaging entirely in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” said the Palestinian Authority president, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was again on a mission to form a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to include all Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990s. Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States was sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also promised to hold Palestinian general elections on the United Nations General Assembly.
The last one was in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I will convene in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president said.
Abbas also defended in his speech on the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers of “full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded a speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to fulfill with all respect for the United Nations.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas’s speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader “will rather focus on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership.”
Danon, however, noted by the agencies, did not refer to Netanyahu’s annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in sensitive points of Przemyśl
The history of the border crossing shows that the AED automatic defibrillator can save people’s lives.
The voivodeship Ambulance Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be in the sensitive points of the city.
For their attitude, officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Voivodship Ambulance Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior trainee Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs and Tax Office in Przemyśl.
On 28 August they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. A duty-card service officer spotted a lying unconscious man in the pedestrian zone.
The Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, called on September 23, a Communist Party secretary from her home village to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body butchered, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose, and mouth were whole in blood,” says the woman.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phones with me, and there were a lot of police officers around who didn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressed to sign a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died of an “unfortunate accident.”
PLN 105 million for companies from the video game industry from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of co-financing will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, included the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a real world map with an application enabling data transmission by users; a test and training platform to verify practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative model of gameplay based on the interaction of the virtual industry with the application of the global concept.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
“The specialist research agenda of GameINN and the already PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program are an important impulse for the further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedevu,” the statement said.
The video game industry is a perfect example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Incentemers introduced by the government for innovation-involving entrepreneurs, such as R&D reliefs, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a very competitive market,” says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovations not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters of more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of the NCBR Dr. inż. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the two previous competitions, 78 innovative projects were awarded to PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the third competition and the variety of submitted applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects on solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for co-financing of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for co-financing of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of co-financing of approx. 317 million zlotys.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million of co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition can be found on the ncbr.gov.pl website.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polskie Gry Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg’s watch
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who came from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not any, because it is worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't appear in class the next day, explaining stomach problems.
The case was ensterious from the beginning.
Players in the cloakroom have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga has finally pleaded guilty to the the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the Dane's money for his watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He joined Nice as a 13-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but the club said, “L’Equipe” would likely solve it with immediate effect.
For now, he has initiated disciplinary action against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you’re washing your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands to a sufficient degree.
Most of us wash them shorter!
It is enough to have hot water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
Washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hand, but also: finger tips (connected or individually) – rub them with circular movements against the interior of the other hand, the spaces between your fingers (weave your hands, rubbing your fingers on yourself), thumbs – each thumb includes the other hand and in such a way we turn to the right and left with it.
In an emergency situation (when it is impossible to wash our hands) wet hands with a wet tissue, and then use antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch with washed handles or doors (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
Iranian President Says He has rejected a proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran has not entered into talks with the U.S. side at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite an offer to lift sanctions by the Americans, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side who asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not engage in a maximum pressure atmosphere
Iran's president said he had not agreed to take up these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he met with U.S. diplomats because he succumbed to France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure.”
“Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said it did not rule out talks with the United States, and the European parties accused the European parties of the nuclear deal favoring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a prerequisite that does not allow” to establish a dialogue.
If we can abolish this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such an interview in the past week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no.”
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said ‘no!’ tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to save the 2015 Iran deal they were signatories in some form.
It stipulated that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program, and the nuclear sector would be in control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
Nothing came of it so far.
Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has said that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the NSA.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur about removing him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, initiated an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told about his wife’s mental problems, to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the hate group, was removed from the office of the National Court Register, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He says there is no evidence for this except the fake screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he divorces.
Exactly the same is the basis for the other judges associated with the “Cast”: everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they're going to bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, and is silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which stopped the phone in June in another case.
Police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out in the report from February.
There is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, no case of “Castle”.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banaś about renting a tent house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA checks its property statements.
And he'll check when he's checking.
And the Committee of Ethics of the Deputies will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow gathered to make a bizarre decision to remove Banaś’s deputies and appoint as the acting legatee, although the law of such a bizarre combination does not provide for).
The whole reminds me of an American novelty, probably American, about how my wife comes home and finds a husband with a mistress in bed.
She is so astonished and devastated that she cannot exquidate a word.
He stands in the door speechless, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And the husband's making a bed.
When the wife regains his voice and shouts, what is it?
Who is that woman?
Husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?
Only in the case of “Kasta” or Banasia there is a parody of the state.
And it's not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the finale of the high jump
Earlier returning to the competition this season after the break of the maternity athlete, the bronze medalist of the World Championships from London 2017, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 managed to achieve it only in the third approach.
“I am happy.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically,” Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
In the qualifiers, the best turned out to be the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.

Start at an hour. 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in a serious condition
He was admitted to the hospital, and his doctors describe his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe it will come of it, that he will win again.
We are all praying that he will recover,” said Kornel Morawiecki’s anonymous person in an interview with the journalists of “Super Express”.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am still in the close family and politics,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview two weeks ago he gave to the journalists of the “Super Express”.
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been sent to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
It turned out I had jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had a pancreatic cancer...”, the Prime Minister’s father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent major surgery at the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki told, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain to the hospital priest Zbigniew Kras.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
“I know that many people pray for me for what I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don’t have metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to be undergoing chemotherapy.
I surrender myself to the hands of specialist doctors who are rather of a good idea.
For now, after this severe operation, I have to go back to some state of use.
I hope that everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with “SE”.
“If I had given up too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would say goodbye to it,” he added.

The power of Oława jumps.
The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon on September 15 at the hippodrome at Oleanda Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.
The way is long to the true power, but this is what one of the types of horse competition is described as...
The jumping power competition consists in overcoming by the rider and the horse higher and higher obstacles that in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-term and still unbeatable world record, set in 1949, by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Oława, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazones at the level of 135 cm is also not the worst...
The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS “W saddle”, were a show part of the slightly earlier “Rainbow Equestrian Competitions”, which we write more broadly in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazones training riding in Oława JKS joined the competition.
Four competed on the kush and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra, riding the mad “Sprinter”, did the best part.
This small, but dynamic steed began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and finished only with the station with the upper beam away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals were postponed by the jury of the competition.
The second place in pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding “Famy” and the third Lena Boruń on “Harmidera”.
The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" fought ambitiously.
Even greater emotions were accompanied by the starting amazons and viewers during the competition with the participation of large horses.
The threatening-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, riding the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the “Flight”.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” in the park was supposed to take her by Weronika Luczkiewicz.
We needed either an assistant coach or another horse to a couple, followed by a little crazy “Wineta”.
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also drank full of duties, so sometimes in the pits and on the expansion room it got dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz reassured some of the frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska performed well on the park, riding a beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This dignified mare, in combination with an experienced amazon, followed by the second approach in the final phase as the first one jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at the moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also included the same height at the “Declaration”, Weronika Luczkiewicz on “Winecut” and Anastasia Abramenko on “The Flying”.
So all these riders went together to decorate the flomsk and to receive the awards in the form of equestrian equipment, and finally together with the amazons on ponies in the Tkeki track in the Radecki march, he finished an impressive round of honor, ending with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thanks for the
The Equestrian Sports Club “In Siodle” would like to thank the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th “Rainbow Equestrian Competition”: the Municipal Office in Oława, the Waterworks and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Office and the “Mustang” company.
Max Kolonko cuts off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
The KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution led its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and KWW itself the Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Kolonko has now announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with the KWWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I will expect from the above-mentioned KWW to remove my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect me with the aforementioned entity,” he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action, or whether it is the end of the Revolution Formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, reported on the creation of a new political formation, the R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’re fed up with politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s program includes issues concerning the judiciary (they should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equal to the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for NATO’s eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, a reduction in the number of deputies or the introduction of single-member electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media page information suggesting that he would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately occurred.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium point
“The euro course will continue in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4.35, accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectation to maintain a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy is in favour of stabilizing the zloty’s quotations at the current level,” says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing politics.
“While the zloty is actually valued – the euro’s quotations should continue in the vicinity of the ceiling of PLN 4.35 – Polish bonds are not attractive in the coming months.
Significantly more profitable yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the downturn in the world.
“The global slowdown may still be worse, but there should be no severe recession, and at most the rise of GDP growth slightly below zero,” Bolliger said.
“Investors should be underweighted by global actions that may be undermined by the lack of prospects for resolving the U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Europe should be relatively weaker among the stock markets,” according to the latest letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US, as they are more vulnerable in conditions of heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the long term, the return on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term, by easing the monetary policy of banks.
The Fed has the biggest field for rate cuts, which should lead to the weakening of the US currency in the next years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is the ceiling of $1.29, which would mean a 19 percent potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a decline in global monetary policy gaps.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term, they may not allow current and budget deficits,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of National Defence
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential statement made in the German National Defence Ministry.
The press was provided by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State in the Ministry of National Defence Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons have so far managed to re-track, one part of the weapons and 3,474 ammunition.
Among the military equipment that still remains missing, there are six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The situation was expressed by the Vice-President of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “persistent.”
All the more so because as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “mistakable balance sheet”.
It was also criticised by the fact that the list did not show whether there was also a weapon there, which was found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a heavy act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the laws governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations against leading German politicians from far-right and racist motives.
On his “blacklist” of the targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, there were, among others. The then Minister of Justice, Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. has illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosive devices.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a given connection is travelled by a minor to the age of two, then the “child’s icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place separated from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airline has already announced the shortcomings of this solution.
The “child icon” will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea was divided by Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we used to be.
“We have to learn tolerance because we’re about to need a map of seating for breathable mouths, drooling or drunkards,” wrote G Sundar.
Another of the Internet users noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour journey,” wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be allowed to take a vacation to Majorca in October as a result of the Thomas Cook travel agency’s bankruptcy on Monday.
As Marc Pons, an autonomous Balearic government official, among 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take part in October’s holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected holidaymakers, who due to the bankruptcy of the British company had to resign from their holiday in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in the November-April period, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already started negotiations with international operators on the “invasion to the Majorca market” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper “Diario de Mallorca”, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
Around 800 are the fired employees of Thomas Cook’s office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with Thomas Cook’s declaration of bankruptcy at many Majorca hotels, the owners of the facilities demanded that guests pay an additional fee for the night.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations until at least the end of October following the declaration of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.
The daily “Diario de Ibiza” on Friday indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group are not intent to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island, British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook travel agency.
They revealed that the most tourists affected in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is in arrears to local tour companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July–September 2019 period of about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's FIFA Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the forefront
The women’s representation of Poland is ranked 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Miłosz Stępiński was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak matches of the team.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were American women who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by Germans, and the third remained Dutch.
Polish women are preparing for ME qualifications.
They were supposed to start them with an away match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by one year due to food poisoning.
In this situation, Polish women will inaugurate their qualifying with the Spaniards on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3, on the trip with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Polish women are the teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the top three teams from second places will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the competitions for the last three passes to the European Championship.
The rate of 16 participants will be completed by the host – England.
The Polish national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
“Rz”: The Smog has crushed the government
“The effects of the ‘Clean Air’ program are small, and the coal ovens will dig this winter as if nothing had happened,” we read on the front page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
“Until now, 82 thousand applications have been submitted under the Clean Air program for co-financing totalling PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
Accepted applications amount to a total of over PLN 915 million, according to "Rz", citing data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred are returned from the program.
The results of the announced program are described by the newspaper as "modest".
Local authorities, quoted by “Rz”, see the failure of “Clean Air” in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by post, any random implementation control.
This would improve the activities,” says the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year the actions were implemented less than 1% of the assumed goal of replacing 3 million digging boilers.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, only PLN 1.4 billion has been reserved,” we read.
Congress agrees to the F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has agreed to sell 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price,” the Polish minister added.
Contract for the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force will eventually power 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department was approved for their sale to Poland.
The investment will support national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fighters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets
The F-35 Lightning II fighter produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seater and single-engine fifth-generation multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombing and typically hunting air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
Recently, the F-35 was bought by Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
The purchase of U.S. warplanes will also be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
He wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie Manufacturer Launches a Gender Neutral Puppet Series
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the “Creatable World” series wear wigs.
Children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
The emphasis on the characteristics of the sexual characteristics was also abandoned – the gender dolls no longer have full lips, long lashes and slim waist or – in the case of Ken – broad arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender mind inhibits the ambitions of girls and amplify traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy women’s stereotypes” such as the unnatural body proportion.
The company has responded to criticism and has already launched dolls of different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: next door or club Together may have several deputies
Zandberg, when asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the Sejm of the SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people associate hope that the Left is no longer only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 MPs.
“This may mean that around or the club Together will have a dozen MPs.
But it depends on the Polish women and the Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think that Poles rewarded this diversity, because we showed that by different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start was the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the center-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, noting that the SLD will get the entire subsidy, he replied that “the goal of a political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to the Sejm he would vote for himself.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
“The offer is diverse and in this offer are candidates, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will say, however, very honestly and clearly that if I were in the Senate district, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I don’t think I would like to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the KO candidate – PAP),” he added.
In this district, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland, Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS, take part in this district.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opens
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, cars and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi movement of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began a decade ago in a wet six-hectare area handed over by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque (“The paths to paradise”) comes from the title of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, venerated by the followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with Carague marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque can hold 15,000 worshippers, and the other can stay on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by the workers from Morocco.
The builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has funded lighting, sanitation and financed 10.5 million euros of road works.
Smyła coach: Our problem is not Silesia, we are ourselves
The eight league matches will be delivered without a victory, the Crown players will try to stop in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian top.
“Our problem is not the Wrocław, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” emphasized coach of Kielce Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far the only victory in the league has been recorded in the first round, when they beat 1-0 the beniminka of the Rakków Częstochowa competition.
Later, the Kielceers recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zagłębie Lubin in 1/32 of the Polish Cup final.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match, the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the final whistle did not come from the collapse, but it was the fall of anger, because they were so close,” Smyła said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” the coach added.
In Friday's match in the Crown, Ognjen Gnjatic will not play for the excess yellow cards in the Crown, the team will also lack injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
On the other hand, it is important to apply in the knockout match of several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, it seemed like it wouldn’t be there, and now it’s,” Smyła said.
Defender of the Crown Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the league everyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
“We may not show it on the pitch in recent weeks, but there will come a time that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” he said.
After nine rounds of the Estrobi, the Crown with the achievements of five points takes the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at an hour. 20.30.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
“42 percent of the tree species that make up the tree stand of Europe are at risk,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the “Red Book of European Trees” published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnut trees and rowan.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, on the basis of the research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are “highly threatened”.
Among the reasons, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European stands, according to IUCN specialists, 58% of species are at risk and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, threaten to die.
Among the main reasons for deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanization, excessively intense felling of trees, and then forest fires and changes taking place in the European eco-stimism.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also very much in danger.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose in Europe the danger of extinction of important and underestimated varieties that underpin European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” concluded the report by Luc Bas, which heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
“Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for their freedom to lend money, which will have to be paid back by future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away”.
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the election polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczyński’s party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the President of the Civic Platform also marked the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
“First, nothing that is given will be taken away, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes, among others, a project that will give the least PLN 614 per hand to Poland earners, and more earners – also a few hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he does not want to race to distribute.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers bidding with the opposition for distribution, until the country’s financial collapse finally occurred,” he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview for “Rz” that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“We would jeopardize their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Prague is walking before the fall.
Kaczynski is the state man as Banaś is crystalline,” he added.
The leader of the Civic Platform also said that he has not yet decided whether he would run for the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of Great
Six dead condors of great condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz.
Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Big Condos have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators like pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could eat toxic carrion.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
“This is a big waste for the environment because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison exposes not only this species to danger, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun to give the head of your precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s office – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was probably President Ignacy Mościcki used it.
“Rz” reports that soon such a chain may end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to start work on the amendment of the Orders Act and the decorations to restore it.
The daily writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of the head of state.
The Senate has already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost in one voice.
This time the work is instant.
At the beginning of August, senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would consult the President’s Office.
This one arrived in mid-September.
“I am kindly informing you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not submit comments on the position presented in this petition,” wrote the Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s Office responded briefly to us: it is in favour of restoring this,” said the head of the commission, Robert Mamatov of the Law and Justice party, quoted by “Rom.”
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection al. The Cieplinski from al. The Piłsudski.
The actions of the uniformed are related to the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów “Przejezdne intersections”.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of a downhill, not to adapt to light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city.
His words sounded at a press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars after intersections, which in turn creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among others, faster to start at the traffic or not writing SMS messages while driving.
The topic was taken over by Rzeszów policemen, who from today start the action “Przejezdne intersections”.
- What's the matter?
The aim of the activities is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to the intensification of traffic difficulties and the creation of traffic jams.
It is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to not adapting to light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of smoothness, late start-ups under the beacons, free intersections and leaving too long distances between the vehicles.
At which intersections will the activities be carried out?
Among others on ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellonian; al. The Cieplinski from al. Piłsudski; ul. The market with al. Piłsudski; Śreniawitów Square from ul. Dąbrowskiego or ul. Hetmian of al. The insurgents of Warsaw.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on the next five Fridays of October.
They inspected the waste disposal company from “Czajka”
“Eithers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wołomiński County and the District Construction Surveillance Inspection inspected on Friday, an installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of,” said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the Wallachian district.
Inspectors from the Włomino starosty carried out an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka commune.
The “Dar-Transport” private Trade Department, under the agreement with the capital’s sewage treatment plant “Czajka” provides sewage waste management services.
“The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business,” Szyszko said.
He added that the audit report will be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last audit in “Dar-Transa” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015. – 11 February 2016
It was then established that the company did not take samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of studies of stabilised municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka”.
After the inspection of WIOŚ, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota, a private commercial plant “DAR-TRANS” “DAR-TRANS” is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal in the excavation area, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed in forests near Zielonki.
Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was excluded from operation, which was related to the damage to one of the incineration equipment.
According to MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (conducted on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“You have taken a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wałęsa said on Friday to Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition for prime minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “only a supporter in retirement”.
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre.
Wałęsa’s son, Jarosław, also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
“You took on a difficult task,” Lech Wałęsa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my total support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, the great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błońska.
A very important words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked for the support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words to me, because no one can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important it is,” she said.
“Let us show that you can make another, wise policy together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is what you have done your revolution, and we want to change Poland like this,” Kidawa-Błońska said.
Fans in retirement
Wałęsa in an interview with journalists said that he is now “only a retired supporter”.
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, checked, (to this) we will return.
The tri-division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And all this needs to be cleaned, all this needs to be restored to normal action and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, we have a street criterion ahead of us," said Lech Wałęsa.
“Therefore, it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think and make a decision themselves.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-Błońska added.
“The last chance that we will improve the situation of things in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to build the foundation again.”
Asked about the most important changes that should be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The president said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all other things.
Since the tri-division of power does not exist, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move forward.

Senate decides on key laws
The Senate passed without amendments to the Act on the disclosure of the assets of the most important government officials and about flights of the most important people in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the Act on the property of the families of government officials – without amendments, 14 were against and three abstentions.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday’s debate by PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to “civilize” the law and limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration about the property situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adopted to cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to submit a statement.
The Act on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important public officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister’s office, was adopted by the Sejm on September 11.
The regulations assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Deputies, MEPs, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the declaration the information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common life.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.
The Act also clarifies who is responsible for running the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 against and four abstentions.
According to the bill, every flight of the president will be a flight “executed in an official mission”.
In flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “taken in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function”.
The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, the aircraft may be members of the delegation – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
According to the Act, in the event of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will request their clarification.

Poles after the first training in Paris, are waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in the match for a bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen’s ward, the way to win the title was closed by Thursday’s defeat to Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles with a trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of people present in the class, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As noted by Heynen’s assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol, this time the main task was not to practice volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending it together more than training it.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We have been brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed we would go back to that game.
We discussed this match with each other on the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As two main reasons for failure, I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect,” he analyzed.
In his opinion, “White-Red” did not stand the stress of the fight against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by the loud and large audience, the co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions could have put a little bit to sleep the smooth road to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson faster and then we would have played differently in the further phase of the tournament.
But it’s only whenbauch,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat Poles will be able to turn into aggression in the match for bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's something to fight for.
We last won the ME medal in 2011,” he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poles during this championship.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and they moved to Ljubljana for the semi-final.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on launches and a $25,000 fine in half a year of suspension for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds at recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the vices of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both penalties are withheld for six months – a probation period in which a recalcitrant athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but has been messing with a kind of tennis world record for a long time and has earned a specific tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in history of discipline a single financial penalty for violating the rules of behavior on and next to the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing game against Karen Khachin – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, he paid $113,000.
In the U.S. Open 2019, he did not play long, but managed to publicly say that ATP activists “were corrupt”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption, after hearing the accused and learning the context of the speech.
However, in the justification, the tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’s behaviour for the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to lodge an appeal and immediately postpone the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of the applicable professional tennis players, in particular it can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with the judges and the public, or any other way to behave indecently.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also consult with people specializing in solving problems of athletes not dealing with the right behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment on the verdict was, “Hey, everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, because in the Laver Cup he was intensified, so he had to give up his next races in Beijing (September 30 – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: In Poland, we are living better and better
The report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday shows that as a good or rather good, 44% of them assessed their financial situation last year.
A year earlier, this figure was 37.2 percent, in 2016. 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
He considered himself bad or rather bad his material situation last year. A total of 8.1 per cent of households, compared to 11.2 per cent a year earlier and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The financial situation of the households of self-employed workers is the best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the other pole are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the financial situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.
The worst is for single parents, of whom 32% declare good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage ranges from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst of its financial situation was judged by single parents raising offspring and large families (of at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Next are Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazovian (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolskie, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% last year. national average, and in Lubuskie 98 percent.
The highest income was paid by the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 percent. national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was in 2018. 1693 PLN.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, this is a fairly low result.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3 percent.
Although the increase in income is slowing down, it also inhibits the increase in spending.
Those on a per person were elevated last year. PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, spending per person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 its share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

US: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board the USS George H. W. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, five crew members of this ship have been killed.
Previous suicide occurred in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot last week.
Each event occurred on land when the USS George H. W. W. Bush was moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded in the case.
In addition, death is not to be related.
“It takes everyone to get involved in suggesting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent more suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions related to the search for help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Unsiołowski critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, his every sentence was accepted.”
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate Rydzyk’s harmful activity is a great shadow over his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best during the life of the Polish pope,” he explained.
The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: “there were murmours of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once did not accept Rydzyk, but he had power and for political society could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, similarly to his successor,” explained Niesiołowski.
“Besides, this fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their lack, has come to this.
I ran a little outlined in thought, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these abominable matters,” he told the Niesiołowski journalist.
In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“It is necessary to admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly”, argued Niesiołowski.
“I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few other such things,” he concluded.

Griffin disqualified
The clash as part of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk ended a little badly, when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, set by fans from Wejherowo, passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatana Alomerovic.
After the incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match to their own stadium.
They will also not be able to travel to league matches by December 31.
Burdy at the Widhag Stadium also evoked fans of Silesia Wrocław.
Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitised the relevant authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the sector to be accused of rotating the sector of Lodz fans, setting up chairs and pushing the host sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organization of trips for matches in this and subsequent PP edition.
The ban on trips also included Ekstraklasa league matches, but will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace markings across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the Regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the registration of names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, for example. “Lviv” will appear next to L’viv.
In our province, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment to the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the towns in neighbouring countries often have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change prepared by us in the law, they will finally appear on the signs on our roads.
The introduction of a new marking begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway”, informed Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand zlotys.
In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by November 1, 2019.
What does the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be without replacing the boards, on the principle of stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the towns with new ones, written in Polish on already existing characters.
Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish, and then in the original, in brackets.
It will be a great facilitation for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the state in which they are located.

Someone shot swan from a windbreaker
In the pond in Zamek in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with problems with their wings.
After leaving and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set a target from the animal – a shot from the windbreaker was found in his body.
“The information about the wounded bird was received from the inhabitants of the village by the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sól.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
You could see that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of it.
There were slides in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a rehabilitation center.
He winters in the center
“The wounds have been cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the facility where it will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He is not yet able to fly.
The release of it now would involve the fact that it would most likely not survive the winter,” Walasek adds.
The staff, after being treated with the rehabilitation swan, intends to release it in the spring to the same joint.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice after receiving information about the cause of the animal’s poor health intend to inform about the case of the prosecutor’s office.
The incident occurred in Zameczno
Gowin: “we need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.
Gowin during a conversation in “Signals of the Day” on Radio One stated that trade is overrun by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that in fact Polish companies cannot develop.
Note that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of the term, but got a “imman from the European Commission”.
“We have won before the tribunal of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and the government is forming, we will come back to this topic,” he said.
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade”.
“This will have to be considered whether the government, the state, has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake in acknowledging that the Polish retail tax is illicit public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller stores, which could be considered as public aid.
She then stated that the tribute was implemented unlawfully.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU court’s decision of the May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal at the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will begin, i.e. hearing the parties and the possible hearing.
It takes a good few to several months from appealing to the announcement of the sentence.
“This procedure lasts an average of one year,” a source at the Court of Luxembourg told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We suggest a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first opportunity to gather the whole family around the child, together celebrating its appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that the newly minted mom and dad want their children to look the best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about the baby’s outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores you can find many dressing sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several-week-old toddlers were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same beciques or big pillows.
Today, children who come to the sacrament are often older: several months, annual, and even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a big child needs a slightly different christening outfit.
If, therefore, your child is 3–4 months old on the day of Baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a chair or on the hands of the parents or godparents.
The best way to do this will turn out to be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleepers or sets.
Although this item of clothing is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.
For the boy, the ideal one will turn out to be a body with a print of bolts and suspenders.
For older children, you can afford a greater fantasy in your clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls are eagerly looking towards richly decorated, ruffle dresses for baptism complete with coats, wristbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-reducing materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it would be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, apps and cute sets will make your baby look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Perfect outfit for a small gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or porcine often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, tracksuit shorts, and for this blouse decorated on the front on the model of a vest.
These costumes look extremely festive, and at the same time do not embarrass the movements of the toddler.
Krystyna Pawłowicz published a declaration of assets
Krystyna Pawłowicz made a declaration of assets at the end of the term.
It shows that the PiS MP has accumulated PLN 110,000 in savings.
Let us remind you that Pawłowicz announced that she left politics.
At the end of the term of office, it has the amount of PLN 110 thousand
According to the statement submitted by the Member, she collects a pension with a monthly value of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570 thousand and slightly smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.

Earlier, the property statement was also published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on the break in the deliberations at the time of the Conservative Party Conference
British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the annual Conservative Party's annual program conference, which the government has requested.
289 MEPs voted against – 306.
It is customary for the House of Commons to meet at party conferences so that MEPs do not have to resign from either their participation or from the meetings of the Parliament.
However, the opposition parties have acknowledged that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK’s exit from the European Union planned for October 31, parliament should not interrupt the session.
289 MEPs voted in favour of the government’s request for a break, 306 against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The lack of consent for the break may be perceived as a political revenge of the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared illegal by the Supreme Court and as unwilling) and for the fact that, after the ruling of the judges, he does not want to apologize for it.
After this ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s speech and the following turbulent debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of bending Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time to make Brexit.
It must be implemented to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on the priorities of citizens, about health care, about the cost of living.
Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite the country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party Conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and will last until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media write.
The president's spokesman strongly denied the reports.
“It’s just not true,” Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
The Israeli media, among others. Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York declared that it was Israel who was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that “the Poles sucked anti-Semitism with the milk of mothers.”
Andrzej Duda said that he regrets that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a striker shouting: “Pole, Pole”.
“Qitaty is not only inaccurate.
It’s just not true,” Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Duda said he “never said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spegolski, the “it invented” portal.
According to the “JI” interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, decorated the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it was the Jews from Israel “like Israel Kac” who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources from the Boteach, Mosberg said.
Who is Banaś and what was he at fault?
The tenant-leasted tenement house led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banaś’s property declarations.
We summarize another scandal that shook the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Audit Office, has not entered the property statement of the 400-meter tenement house, which is located in Krakow’s Podgórze.
What’s more, his sublease was to run in the aforementioned tenement house (so rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel in the “Supervisor” program pointed out irregularities.
The journalist revealed that Banaś was rented by people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings”.
The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banaś responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.
Interestingly, the tenant rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property declarations.
The tenement house itself was described vaguely in them, and the proceeds from its rental were to be underestimated.
“The mother of Marian Banas and his wife can be worth PLN 6 to 8 million.
In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]...," writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting the control of Marian Banaś’s declarations of assets for the years 2015-2019.
Banaś announced that he will suspend his business at NIK until it is completed. “I will go to the Marshal for unpaid leave,” he said.
The opposition is calling for clarification.
“We do not hear that the CBA expands its investigation or speeded up the examination of Marian Banaś’s property declarations.
That is why we are forced to do the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]”, said Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO MP.
“If a normal Pole so grossly underestimated the rental of its properties, it would already have 10 checks, tax measures and penal and fiscal proceedings,” he added.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of the policeman will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of certain behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
The introduction of such a change is wanted by the police trade unionists.
The idea went to the Sejm’s Committee on Petitions.
“The issue is serious, because already every year more than half a million offences go to Polish courts,” we read.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition, which the Independent Trade Union of Police is writing to MPs on changing the code of offences has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording of the article. 54a of the Code of Offences.
He would read: “Anyone who does not submit to the request or command of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to a penalty of arrest, a fine or restriction of freedom.”
“The couple. 3 of this provision refers to the same penalty for those who, without following instructions, will prevent or hinder the performance of a work," the log says.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal of the provision, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in matters of political manifestations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, it would be unfavorable and instead of alleviating the situation, even to exacerbate it,” he adds.
Statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86 percent of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.
Buras worries about Europe
Jochym Topol has the writing in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today mentioned in one row with V?clavem Havl.
So, from the very beginning, there was a curse of talent that he was trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with a “sensitive man”.
The protagonists are Buras and Soca, along with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are wandering actors, traveling around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the other time stopped in the age of infants.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
Everyone is only a background to observe a world where there is no room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of clogged provinces, a society of old, suspicious people and a solvulating youth.
The “sensible man” in places turns into an absurd theatre.
The narrative imitates the didaskalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The stage is a Europe full of fears for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is in operation.
The company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandawa court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Now it's OK. 12,000. Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave with the office by the end of the year.
As recently as Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company was now “fully operational” despite the UK’s mother’s bankruptcy, which caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse of last resort talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that in addition to the 900 million-pound rescue plan already agreed in August, the company would get an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

Goerlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the newcomer by the German Goerlitz.
Actions are intended to help in the fight against the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Goerlitz is Germany’s easternmost city.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.
There are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in the number of inhabitants.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which translated into a 25% decrease in the city’s population.
In 2013, it was 54,000.
Wanting to fight the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
For now, 150 applications have been received by the programme.
Two-thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we were applying, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Goerlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel that it doesn’t matter if we’re staying here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacancies, and unemployment is three times higher than the average nationwide.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to obtain the opinions of the participants of the program.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, in charge of the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to luring new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
