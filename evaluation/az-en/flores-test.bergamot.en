Gold can be put into any shape. It can be rolled up in a small way.
It can be converted into thin wire that can be bent and blurred. It can be beaten with hammers and wrapped in sheets.
It can be prepared very thinly and glued on other metals, even in such a delicate way, it can sometimes be used to decorate the hand-drawn paintings of books called "illuminated manuscripts."
These are called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using black cabbage juice. 
Due to the acidity or alkaline content of the chemical, cabbage juice changes color.
The pH level in the chemicals analyzed is determined by the amount of hydrogen (pH in the pH) ions they contain.
The protons separated from their electrons are considered hydrogen ions, since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron.

Siphone toilets connected to a complex sewerage system are characteristic of almost all homes of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro cities.
In Greece, the remains of a sewerage system were found in homes in the cities of the Min-Ove of the Crete and Santorini Islands.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Iran and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women went together, in a mixed way.
Through the satellite, you can call someone who is thousands of miles away from you.
Immediately after receiving the satellite signal sent into space, it reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Because the planet Earth's atmosphere partially disrupts light and image, scientists use a telescope in space.
The satellite or telescope can be put into space with a large rocket with a length of only 100 feet.
The greatest achievement that a significantly changing wheel has made to us is easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this invention, we have gained train, car, as well as many other types of transport.
Under these are larger cats, which feed on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antilopes and gazelles.
Finally, small cats (including comfortable domestic cats) have a large number of hunts, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their achievements is based on the concept of wood, consisting of expressions that are uncompetitive, every cat with a special job they have.
Leos are the most social cats living with gangs called the prayer.
The prides consist of up to thirty female lions and puppies, but also an adult male lion between 1 to 3.
Females are usually very attached to each other as a large family of girls and sisters.
Leo prayers act like monsters or dog flocks, which are surprisingly similar to themselves by their behavior (not to other big cats) and a deadly hunter for their prey.
The tiger has the skills to climb (middle level), swim, jump long distances and pull 5 times more than a strong person.
Tigers (from the genus Panther) are from the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The fuir-cavity cats are only these four lives.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roary he utters, but is more like a churnish and tingling sounding.
Ocelots feed on small animals, e.g. monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than that.
According to scientists, the ocelots find and watch the place where they are.
Ocelots are able to see very well in the dark with their vision at night, and they also act in secret, mixing around their own prey and hunt them at the first opportunity.
When a small group of living things (a small population) are separated from the population to which they belong, they fall into a different location than the environment in which they previously lived (e.g., if they are taken to the other side of a mountain or river, or a new island, they cannot return easily).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics and adaptations to become a stronger competitor than its previous form.
The initial form of the population has not actually changed, they need the same adaptation as before.
As the newly populated population gradually begins to adapt to the environment, they are less like others.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, 2 species will not be able to be attributed to the same sex, perhaps because it will look more different than today.
We call this process of formation of species, which means that we are talking about the formation of new species. This process is an inevitable consequence of the evolutionary process and a very important component.
Plants produce oxygen necessary for people to breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide when they secrete (when giving breath).
Plants ripen by photosynthesis through the sun. They also cast a shadow.
We use plants to build our home and plant our clothes, most of the nutrients we eat are plants. Animals could not live without plants.
Since Mosasaurus was the wild at the peak of his time, he was not afraid of other creatures except the mosasaurs, which had his own relatives.
 In his long jaws, there were more than 70 sharp teeth, an additional set on his top palate, which meant that nothing could escape from his hand.
Of course, although we don't have accurate information, we think it's a fork-shaped language. Its food was made up of turtles, large fish, and other mosaseurs, and it can even be assumed that it was a hannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like Trex, could not rival him.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans have different feast dishes, such as wild boar, peacots, snails, and cut-cut species.
Another difference is that while the poor and a woman were sitting in chairs, the rich people were having dinner together, and they were sitting down and eating their food.
In the following centuries, food coming from America or Asia to Europe was not included in ancient Roman cuisine.
That is, they had no corns, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted Indian meat.
The people of Babylon built a chief temple for each of the gods, which was regarded as the house of God.
While the monks were trying to meet the demands of the gods with ceremonies and holidays, people would also make sacrifices to their gods.
Each of the worshiphouses has a fireplace and a sanctuary where only monks can enter.
Sometimes special towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was intended only to worship God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Living outdoors was often a way of life of Hebrew families.
The ladies were preparing food in their yards, the shops consisted only of open looms overlooking the street. The stones were used to build a house.
There were no large forested areas in the land of Canaan, so wood products were extremely expensive.
In Greenland, the population is located in a sparse point. Norwegian epics say that the Red Man is walking westward when he was exiled from Iceland because he killed, where he discovered Greenland and called it.
But the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time, regardless of his discovery.
 Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are the "Scandinavian" countries, but there are many differences between their peoples, kings, traditions and history.
If you think that behind the Declaration of Independence is written a treasure map, you have watched the film "National Treasure."
However, this is not true. What is written behind the document is not a scheme that leads to the burial.
Behind the Declaration of Independence is the words "The original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" in the lower part.
It is not known who wrote this document (241⁄2 inches in length and a width of 293⁄4 inches), which consists of a large pergance paper wrapped for storage, but it is known that he wrote it early in his life.
So the notation is probably only added as a label.
Thanks to Normandy landings and ongoing fighting, the northern part of France was cleared of enemy captivity, but the southern part was still deprived of liberty.
It was ruled by the French, called "Vichy." This French people, who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, cooperated instead of fighting against the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the name of the occupation plan was "Operation Dragun."
The Americans and the Free France forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks, headed to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that a large group of people living and working together share a community.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin word "civilis" and "civil", which is derived from the Latin word "civilis", "civil", "civitis", "civitis", means "city-state", but also defines the size of society in a certain form.
The predecessor of the nations was the city-states. Civilization culture perceives the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the storage of cultural footprints and a fair spread.
Small cultures are usually not possible to recognize civilization, because they disappear without historical evidence of their own.
According to the matter of the Confederation, the Revolutionary War was still going on when the three-thirteen provinces formed a weak central government, whose only part of Congress was the only part of Congress.
Congress, which did not have the authority to impose taxes, relied on state bodies, which were not very useful in the implementation of all laws, because there was no national executive power or judicial power.
It also does not have the authority to invalidate interstate tax legislation and tariffs.
Before the amendment to the substances was introduced, anonymous consent should be obtained from all states, while states were so indifferent to the central government that the representatives of them usually remained frequented by frequent meetings. 
Italy, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the FIFA World Cup championship in 2006. 
Football, basketball, volleyball, water ball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 are popular sports.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country. The Italians also participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
The Japanese have about 7000 islands (the largest Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan's islands, which have its own, are also called "archipelago" in terms of its geographical location and group.
In the 15th century, after European sailors mentioned the name of the island as "Innoma Formosa" or "beautiful island", Taiwan began the period when it was remembered under those names.
In 1624, the Dutch company East India, in which the Dutch company made a coup in local grain production practices, as well as recruiting Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations, created a base in southwestern Taiwan.
The Tsin dynasty (1644-1912), which captured Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683, declared Taiwan as a province of the Tsin Empire in 1885.
After his defeat in the First China-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Tsin dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which confirmed Taiwan's rule to Japan, which kept it in its hands until 1945.
The Machu consisted of 3 main monuments called Pichu, Intihuatan, Sunstory and Three Window Temple.
Many of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give an impression on tourists about what their originals actually look like.
In 1976, 30% of Machu-Picchi was restored and reconstruction work is still underway.
For example, we can say that the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm film, which was considered the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film cycle.
It is still being produced, but even more importantly, the ratio between the sides is applied in the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
Although the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, in fact 36 mm wide and 24 mm in height.
For this reason, the ratio of this format between the parties (division to obtain the simplest completeness) is 3:2.
Many widespread formats (applicable formats belonging to the APS family can be cited as examples) are equal to or are roughly close to the ratio of width and height.
The most commonly exploited and most often mocked trinial rule is a simple rule that creates dynamism, maintaining a certain range of stages of a picture.
There it is noted that the most effective place for the main object is at the intersection point of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see sample).
The transition of the strengthened and rich Catholic church to the control of the state takes place in this period of European history.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries despite the diversity in religion, language and traditions.
The power that engulfed him all around, from king to people, was influenced by everyone.
One of the basic principles of Christianity was the use of wealth to reduce the suffering and poverty, and that the financial fund in the church served only for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for thousands of years, and the gathering of power and financial resources in such a place raised questions in people that this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after Britain began military operations, Britain besieged Germany from the sea.
Although this blockade violated the generally accepted norms of international law, regulated by several international agreements of the last two centuries, the strategy showed its impact by cutting vital military and civilized safeguards.
To prevent any ship from entering all sections of the ocean, Britain did not hesitate to expose even ordinary ships to jeopardized and mined international waters.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected an analogous response to its unlimited submarine battles.
In the 1920s, the main attitude of many citizens and peoples was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities that took place in World War I, the nations never wish to face such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offered to him at Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the former head of the place where he worked) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China showed different clock belts in a unique way. Every stage of China, or every family in power, was a dynasty of a unique dynasty.
Also, among the kingdoms, the fragmented provinces had different periods. The best known of these was the Three Tsarity period, which lasted 60 years with feuds between the kingdoms of Han and China.
During this period, there were ruthless battles between the nobles fighting for the throne.
These Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history that thousands of people died fighting for the highest wooden seat in the magnificent palace located in Xian.
Many social and political influences include the use of a metric system, the transition from absolute to republicanism, nationalism, beliefs that the country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the professions were the most ambitious and open to all male candidates who were ready to succeed.
The same can be said for the army, because the army ranking was determined not by class, but by calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired the repressed class of workers from other countries to start a revolution.
Muhammad was also deeply interested in issues that were not related to secular issues. To think, he would come to the cave called "Hira" on Mount Light.
In the cave, which is a healthy test of time, there is an extremely clear idea of the spiritual attraction of the Prophet Muhammad.
Completely isolated from the rest of the world, this cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, even though his existence is known, it is difficult to find it. Getting into the cave means being completely isolated.
When you look up, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains that surround it. It's hard to find the world out of this cave.
The Giant in the Gyza is just one of the seven miracles that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramida is one of the great pyramids built to perpetuate the memory of the deceased Pharaoh.
As Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, the chorals of the Roman Catholic society (later called the Grigorian choirs) and the lyturgy rituals led to the development of a type of music spread throughout Europe for the singing of both women and men through papacy and monasteries.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the small pyramids around him were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "top curve" sign is similar to the letter V, while the "sub-curve" sign is reminiscent of a clamp or a opposite square on the lower side.
When you say "top", you need to draw the bow from above to the bottom, and when you say "the bottom", you need to draw the bow towards yourself, starting from the part of the violin (which you hold the summer with your hand).
The wire above is usually softer sound, while the wire below produces stronger and more decisive sounds.
Do not hesitate to put your own marks with a pencil, but the bow marks given in print represent any detail in the music, so they must be followed.
Feared King Louis XVI, Queen Maria-Antoinetta, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Thereza and Louis-Charls) and King's sister Mrs. Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They looked at the king and queen in a carriage, and returned to Paris among a group of people who cried out their hatred, and threatened them.
Due to the large number of people, the King and Queen had to open the windows of the car to the end.
At this point, a man from the crowd shook the head of a kingguard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The combat costs of U.S. imperialism during the invasion of the Philippines were taken from the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to meet a large part of the costs and the bond interest that changed through Wall Street bank branches on behalf of the Philippine government.
Undoubtedly, a sufficiently big profit that would make up the main gain of U.S. imperialism was derived from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people.
To understand the tampliers, it is necessary to understand the context that provokes the ranking of creation.
The 11, 12, and 13th centuries European history period, i.e., known as the Early Middle Ages (BE 1000-1300).
After the early Middle Ages, the early Middle Ages and beyond 1500 years come.
Technological determinism is a term that combines various ideas in practice, from an attempt of technological development, or, from necessity, to a definitive way of thinking that human fate is directed by scientific rights and the main logic of their self-reference in technology.
Most of the comments related to technological determinism are based on two general ideas, such as the advancement of technological development in itself from a large-scale cultural or political impact to a broader path, and technology is not socially conditioned, but "influence" to the unique public.
For example, we can say that motor vehicles play a leading role in the development of roads.
Despite all this, a country-wide transport network is not only economically viable for a small amount of transport, so new production methods are being created that can reduce the cost of owning a car. 
The fact that most of the masses owns a car can not only increase accidents on the roads, but also lead to the invention of new health technologies to treat those who are physically injured in the accident.
It has a great cultural determinism element, derived from writers such as Romanticism, Goethe, Fixte, and Schlegel.
In relation to romance, geography formed individuals, and as time progressed, customs and cultures were formed in accordance with that geography, which were better than the laws, which were arbitrarily defined by harmony with society.
Taking into account that Paris is the center of fashion of the modern world, Constantinople was also considered the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It began to be recognized as the center of luxury in about 400 of our century and retained this rank until the 1100th year of our century.
In the twelfth century, he gradually began to lose his status in the twelfth century, including the fact that the crussaders return from the Byzantium products with more valuables, such as silk and spices.
It was at this time that the title of "Facility Capital" of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
In the period between the 10 and 11th centuries and in the 14th century, the gothic style reached its peak.
First of all, the Byzantine culture of the East affected clothes.
However, the western styles were 25-30 years behind because of the weak connectivity channels.
Western European began to improve the lifestyle in the late Middle Ages. One of the biggest innovations of the time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
 Family agriculture is a type of farm associated with sufficient production of crops to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
In the family-raged farm, agriculture is a system that uses a seed crop that is kept in accordance with the economy together with easy, organic, shifting crop rotation, or a relatively simpler technique to increase crop harvesting.
Historically, many farmers have been engaged in family-agrative farms, and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures combine similar-minded individuals who feel like you're alive in terms of social standards and cause them to create a sense of identity. 
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender identity of members are factors that distinguish subcultures.
The aspects that classify a subculture can be regarded as a unity of language, aesthetics, religion, political, sexual, geographical factors or these. 
Members of a subculture show their membership a characteristic and symbolic use of the style that usually includes fashion, actions, and argotism.
Addressing to several of the sad life stories of children who have been indifferent, unhappy or exploited and raised by adults when raising, are one of the most common methods used to express the importance of socialization.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some of those wild children, people (usually their parents), are arrested at home, and in some cases, their parents throw it away because they reject the child's severe mental or physical defects.
Wild children may be exposed to child abuse or trauma before they are thrown away or run away from someone's hands.
Other children are alleged to have been raised by animals, some of whom live spontaneously in the wild.
The wild child, who is completely human and raised by animals, will show his fear, or indifference to people, by imitating the actions of the animal that almost raises him (within physical limitations).
While the learning process is aimed at making project-based teaching easier and more interesting, the scoffing method brings it to completely new levels.
A temporary device is a tool for students who use new learning methods, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project rather than a teaching method.
Temporary devices are virtual and real, meaning that the teacher is a temporary device, but the same is the small pin in the Micrasoft Office.
Virtual temporary devices are intrigued in software and are designed to ask questions related to the procedures that the student may have difficulty, to receive quick answers and to explain the procedures.
For different reasons, such as neglect, ruthless treatment and even violence, children are given to guardian families.
How many children should not grow up in an environment where there are no teachers, who feed him, care for him, do not have a training and educator.
We regard the Care System of Trusteery as a safety area for those children.
Safe home, caring caregiver, stable education and ensuring reliable health care is a must in the guardian family system.
All the needs of children who are lacking in the house should be met in the guardian family.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the Internet lead to added values in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" for the use of the Internet are offered as important types of motivation (James et al., 1995).
Aimi and McCord (1998), which examined the mass's attitude to websites, determined that "personal participation" and "sustainable relationships" are new motivational factors.
The use of video recordings, micro-tests that drew several milliseconds, have led to significant findings in disclosing facial movements.
In particular, it was suggested that it could be understood whether someone was lying or not.
In an article called the President's Speech, Oliver Sax talks about the fact that people can correctly appreciate the sincerity of the speaker, even if people do not understand the speech due to brain trauma.
He claimed that even some animals, such as domestic dogs, were involved in interpreting human behavior.
Twenty-to-century studies have shown that genetic diversity has two bases, which are hidden and expressed. 
Mutation generates new genetic diversity, and the choice brings it out of the expressed variants.
Separation and reunification mix variations back and forth between two groups of each generation.
In Savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system to meet the needs of amino acids that are there. 
Not even being able to do this can have serious consequences, such as growth depression, poor nutrition, and finally death.
The most convenient obtained plant resources can be proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult digestible foods for primates, just like ours, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) provide a high amount of proteins, not only easily digestible, but also with all amino acids that need in the body.
When we take into account everything, we should not be surprised if our grandfathers solved the "protein problem" as the chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Unfinished sleep is the process of sudden waking up while asleep and falling asleep again in a short period of time (10-60 min.).
This can be easily applied without completely awakening you, using a relatively weaker voice call-watch simply to regain your consciousness.
If you turn it off and fall asleep when the clock rings, you'll have to get up from your bed to get out of bed.
Other biorhythm-based options include taking too much fluid before going to bed (especially water or tea, or a diuretic that you know) and often resort to urination.
A person's inner level of calm is in the opposite proportion, with the level of tension in that person's body and soul.
Where there is little tension, there is so much love for life. The desire to have complete comfort and satisfaction is inherent in everyone.
Everyone can be educated. The only thing that stops this goal is our own tension and our pessim.
The Tibetan faith of Buddhism refers to the Buddha's exhortations, but the way of love for Mahayan has been even more comprehensive with many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Kundalini Yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, which consists of the way of meditation and love, is very simple in principle.
Kundalini energy (thinking clarification) is awakened by Kundalini with Yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and yoga movements such as imagination. 
Yoga of Dividality stands at the heart of Tibetan meditation. For the cleaning of energy channels and activation of chakras, images of a variety of heavenly beings are shown, and enlightenment consciousness awakens.
Germany, which led to the joint movement of the USSR and the United States in World War II, was a common enemy. With the end of the war, system, process and cultural clashes led to the separation of countries.
2 years after the end of the war, the previous allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
 The Cold War, with the real "armys" of Africa, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, lasted for the next 40 years.
After the collapse of the Polish defense on September 17, 1939, it was the only hope left to retreat and reorganize under the shadow of Romania.
However, in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement of 800 000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union, namely the Soviet-Poland Non-Aggressive Pact and other international agreements signed in both two-and-way, after the occupation of eastern regions of Poland, these plans lost their power overnight by entering Belarus and Ukraine.
The most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods between the oceans was to use cargo ships.
Traditionally, the work of fleets was to protect the ability of your country to transport its people and goods, but also to interfere with the enemy's transportation of its people and goods.
The North Atlantic Operation of World War II is one of the most noticeable examples of this recently. To help Britain, the Americans were trying to carry men and materials from the Atlantic Ocean to the country.
At the same time, the German fleet tried to prevent this movement, mainly using U submarines.
Only Germany could have conquered Britain as the rest of Europe so that the allies could be defeated in this struggle.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In ancient cultures, tribes began to keep them in ancient cultures so that they could easily get milk, wool, meat and skin.
Usually, the house goats that join in flocks walking on hills or other pasture areas look more like shepherds, but usually children and teenagers. Such methods are used today.
The highways were built in England in the early 16th century.
While carriageways consisted only of wooden supports parallel to each other, they allowed horses to pull them along with heavy loads to increase their speed on more difficult roads.
The sleepers were presented quickly enough to keep parts of the railway in place. Still, over time, if there was an iron on these rails, it was assumed that these roads would be more favorable.
This began to be used as a widespread application, but iron-palled carriages were getting overflowing more quickly with wood wheels.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with steel wheels, and full steel rails were first put on the market in 1767.
Two million years ago, people began to walk with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning a steep man), and thus became the first vehicle we know to be a walk on foot.
The habit of walking upright was not in the Australopithecs.
Signs of bile-leggedness were discovered 4.2-3.9 million years ago in the remnants of Australopithec, however, seven million years ago, Sahelantrops could also walk on two legs.
We can take the first step by showing a more friendly attitude to nature, joining environmental protection movements, and even being active to prevent some degree of damage that could be caused to nature in the future.
In most cases, it is like a symptomatic treatment. But if we do not want to solve problems only temporarily, we must identify and neutralize their roots.
It is obvious that the successes in the scientific and technological sphere in humanity have turned the world into a different place, the large number of people and the interest of people in the extravagant lifestyle have led to an even greater increase in problems.
After the Congress was passed on July 4, the manuscript of the law, signed by Congressional Chairman John Hankock and Secretary General Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap, located several buildings.
One night, 150-200 copies of the document, known as "Dunlap broadsides," were removed.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
George Washington read a copy sent to him on July 6 to his troops in New York City on July 9. The other copy reached London on August 10.
As we know, the 25 posters of Dunlap, which have been kept so far, are the oldest copies of the document that have reached our hands. The original handwriting copy does not exist.
In the modern world, most palentologists believe that a group of dinosaurs are saved and still live. We call them birds.
The reason why many people do not accept them as dinosaurs is because they have feathers and fly.
But birds still have many sides that resemble dinosaurs.
These birds with legs with skin and nails, like scales, are able to lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaur rexs.
The manipulation of data encoded with binary numbers constitutes the working principle of almost all computers used today.
The number of two values has only one, i.e. 0, or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers or bits in the computer language.
Internal poisoning can not quickly manifest itself. Since symptoms such as vomiting are very common, it is not always possible to make an accurate diagnosis.
The presence of toxic household appliances with a chemical composition is the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Read the brochure, where emergency medical aid instructions are mentioned against this particular venom.
Entomologists use the term insect in a common sense for insects belonging to this group.
This term originated because we have been familiar with woodenbits that have the ability to live as parasites in the human body since ancient times.
Both bloodthirsty insects and woodenbits are dangerous, they are capable of living in the nest or in the home of the organism in which they are located.
There are about 400 000 known cases of Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which indicate that it is mainly observed as a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged patients.
Dispersed sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of skull, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have found that the probability of spreading sclerosis among women is twice as high as men.
A couple may think that raising a child is contrary to their own interests or the interests of their children.
These couples can make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the child's biological parents refuse their parental rights so that the other family can become his parent.
The main purpose of science is to study the way of the world's work by scientific methods. In fact, this method is a pioneer of many scientific studies.
However, in fact, this is not just an experiment, but a test used to eliminate the assumption of one or more probability, asking questions and making observations is also part of scientific research.
Scientists of nature and philosophy studied classical texts, most often the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were used in all scientific issues, including psychology.
As the level of mastery of the Greek language decreased, the West gradually began to break from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Rhythms that mainly depend on the existence of endogenous periods and their emergence through biological clocks are more common in physiology and behavior.
It is designed for most living concepts, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, which are not reacted to external signals.
Although not with external influence, free circuiting periodic periodics are called biological clocks that can continue and self-regulate.
It was one of the main ideas put forward based on the experience of Hershi and Chause, where DNA was a genetic material.
Hershi and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their DNA into bacteria.
To conduct two experiments, they marked the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus and the proteins of the bacteriophague with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can affect in different forms, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the infected genetic material fragment, and whether the infected cell is seed cells.
Mutations that can only pass on to children when the seed is in the cell can cause cell death or cancer when they are elsewhere.
Tourism trips organized in the sheep of nature attract more attention from people who are interested in walking natural places to enjoy the landscape, including the plant, animal and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birds watching and walking in parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem can be an example of activities in the spot.

Every morning, people get in cars to go to work, leave their small towns, and those who have jobs in the place where they come along the road pass to the opposite side.
In this dynamic route scheme, each is connected to a system based on personal vehicles in a form, and it supports it.
Science has shown that the massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from a stable state that supports human evolution in the past two years.
Almost everyone who is a member of the society complains about such public transport, even if they use public transport.
You rarely hear complaints in similar content, such as water quality or bridge flying in developed countries.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they have problems every day? Are the engineers of the vehicles incompetent? Or something more basic is happening.
Road traffic is an analysis of the movement of drivers individually and between two points of vehicles and the interactive connection that vehicles create with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate road traffic, because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers, as a rule, demonstrate sufficiently logical behavior, so the flows of movements usually fit into a certain logical framework and can be represented even from an approximately mathematical point of view.
In order to better express traffic, a connection has been created between three main characters, such as (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and implement highways.
The ability of insects to fly, which is considered the first to air, allowed them to easily flee from the enemy, find food and mate more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings by assembling them on tops.
These features give them small spaces in a wide range of places where they can protect themselves from the wild.
At present, there are only two insects that cannot accumulate their wings on their backs, one of which is a needle and the other is water chests.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristorchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
While some thought it was right, most people, on the contrary, believed that the Sun itself (even other stars), the solar system orbits the Earth.
 This idea seems logical because it is not felt like the planet Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river on Earth and the second longest river on Earth. Its water is 8 times higher than the size of the second river.
The largest river on Earth, the Amazon, has a width of 6 miles in some places.
20 percent of the water from our planet's rivers to the oceans belongs to the Amazon.
The main Amazon River, which collects water from thousands of small rivers, is 6387 km (3980 miles). 
Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued to the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the pyramids of the Giza pyramids were invincible in terms of the technical perfection of their dimensions and constructions.
The new Kingdom of the Ancient Egyptians was amazed at the monuments of its predecessors, which were already a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has about 800 people. It is considered the smallest, the smallest, the country with the lowest population in the world.
Italian is the language of law and official communication in Vatican City.
Italian is a language that is used daily by most of those who work in the province, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
Roman Catholics are Vatican citizens.
 In nature, there has been information from ancient times of people about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, which are discovered in natural form and can be more easily removable than primitive tools.
According to Aristotle's theory, everything is made up of one or more of four elements. These elements were air, water, fire and earth.
This is more similar to the fourth of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it assumed that those substances turned into new substances to shape what we wanted to see.
Clears are mainly derived from a mixture of two or more metals. Let's not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table of chemical elements.
Chemical elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metal. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to obtain alloys containing non-metalic elements such as a small amount of carbon.
The substances made up of small particles called atoms make things matter in the universe.
The volume of atoms is so small that if the atom combines trillions, it will be as much as a point at the end of the sentence.
Since its invention, it has become a good friend of many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods were discovered, the use of pen has decreased even more.
People are now writing their message on a computer screen, and pencil carves are getting more and more into history.
In this case, we only have to guess what the keyboard will use after a new invention.
The principle of operation of a nuclear bomb is based on the energy needed to connect the nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy-duty cart to a high ground. With the redistribution of the nucleus, some of the energy is separated.
In some atoms, the tendency to break down with very little push or without push is very strong because they have an unstable nuclear.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called a shell.
The shell has about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Under dark layers called "Maria", it is thinner and thicker beneath the mountainous areas.
Since the moon's visible face is thinner than Earth, there may be more lunar seas there. It was easier to get on the surface for basalt lavas.
 The primary purpose of content theories is to determine what motivates people or what appeals.
These theories show that there are certain needs or desires that people hold within as they grow older.
These theories learn what drives certain people to the action they take, and what makes them do in the environment in which they live, or not, make them certain actions.
Maslow's Ierarchical Theory of Demands and Herzberg's Two Factor Theories are two popular theories from a group of motivational theories.
In general, two types of behaviors can manifest themselves when the bosses begin to conduct their previous colleges. One of the endings of this spectrum is to try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such leaders find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, impose discipline penalties, assess the quality of work, give instructions, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of this spectral line, a person becomes an unrecognizable person who thinks that a group must change everything he does and do everything himself himself.
As a result, the leader is fully responsible for whether or not the team will succeed.
This behavioral style often leads to disagreements between leaders and other members of the team.
In terms of the same quality standards, virtual teams are equal to traditional teams with very subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group are usually used as a point of contact for physical teams close to them.
Since their team can meet in various clock belts that are unclear to the local management system, they have more independence than a traditional team member.
One of the indispensable parts of the virtual team is the existence of a true "invisible team" (Lason and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The "invisible team", which each of the members report, is a management team that sets standards for team members.
Why would a company want to take great trouble to win the title of a trained company? Because the only purpose of applying intra-company learning concepts in practice is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used in functional departments of an institution, creativity and mastery can emerge.
Consequently, an organizational process that operates together to overcome a barrier can play a leading role in new innovations that will meet customer needs.
In order for the enterprise to be innovative, management must form a culture of innovation together with knowledge sharing and in-house learning culture.
Angel (2006) explains that the Whole Environmental approach is used as a method that will help companies bring their business to a higher level.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of knowledge. For this reason, it shrinks the field of research and brings it to a more accurate form.
Scientists' research confirms the relationship between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known to everyone that various brain traumas, injuries, slitts and tumors affect human movements and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the development of new technologies, it is possible to observe and study the forms and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to shape imitation templates that make it easier for us to understand the stages in our opinion.
While artificial intelligence has a strong scientific-fantastic meaning, it reveals a very important branch of computer science in the machine associated with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence.
The SI research is about creating techniques for automatic execution of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning and programming, customer diagnoses and answering questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such topics have revealed various disciplines that talk about solving problems encountered in real life.
Since they are installed in software that fits several home computers and video games, the SI system is often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields.
Field excursions make up a large part of any educational program. In many cases, teachers like to take students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Thanks to the virtual travel solution to the areas offered by technology, students will be able to sit in the classroom and watch the exhibits in the museum, watch aquariums or marvelous art patterns.
Virtually sharing any school excursion is a great way to capture this excursion and share our experiences in future classes.
The website, which students from the University School in North Carolina about their journey to the state capital, a new model of the website is being preserved every year, remains an album.
Blogs are effective to improve students' writing skills. Usually, although students start blogging experience with poor grammatical and orthographic knowledge, the presence of an audience changes this situation.
Usually, as students organize the most critical audiences, the author of the bloc makes efforts to further improve writing in order not to be exposed to criticism.
In addition, blogging "encourages students to gather more information about the environment". The desire to draw the reader's attention inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging enhances the spirit of collaboration in students and encourages them to expand their knowledge, which is limited to what they have learned in school.
Students can "reinforce their analytical and critical skills by using blogs" in accordance with "them"; they can often turn to internet materials and come up with a position based on other people's writings, as well as identify their perspective on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Many art galleries and museums located in the two-speaking, marvelous capital of Canada, Ottawa, showcase its past and present.
On the south side, Niagara Falls are located, and in the north, Muskoka and other undiscovered natural beauties.
All this, and more, allows you to regard Ontario as true Canada by foreigners.
In large areas of the north, the population settled sparsely, and in some places almost no human foots.
The comparison of the population surprises many, as more African-Americans are settled in the United States than Canadian citizens. 
There are East African islands in the part of the Indian Ocean that fall on the east coast of Africa.
If we are talking about wildlife, Madagascar is undoubtedly like a continent on the largest and sole.
Many of the relatively smaller islands are independent or dependent on France and are famous as luxurious coastal recreational places.
The Islamic religion, which Arabs brought to these lands, spread to the Gamar Islands and Mayotta.
With the discovery of the sea route that the Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gaman from Europe to the Cape of Hope from Europe to India began to expand and colonize the sphere of influence in the 15th century.
The region is surrounded by Sahel from the north, and the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers report that they are married without regard to the real marital status.
Wearing a ring can also work (not just too expensive).
Women should take into account that cultural diversity can result in what they call aggression, and that this does not resemble any kind of chilling, armed persecution, etc. behavior.
Be determined when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to press your feet firmly on the ground (it is unacceptable, whether there are cultural differences or not!).
E.G. Founded in the 10th century by Barber fishermen, the famous city of Casablanca was called the Anfa and used it as a strategic port city.
The Portuguese left Kasa Branca, which they destroyed and restored, after the earthquake in 1755.
The Spanish merchants, who created commercial bases in the city, called the city Casablanca, the sultan of Morocco, rebuilt the city under the name Dar el-Beida.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive places to shop all over Morocco.
Around the ancient city of Medina, it is very easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagins, pottery, leather items, hookahs and various types of decorations, but all of which are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located near Rwanda, at the end of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2002, Goma was in poor condition with lava flowing from the Nyyragongo volcano, with lavas under the influence of many streets of the city, especially the city center.
While the goma is extremely reliable, visits to other places outside Goma should be examined to understand the state of the ongoing war in the North Kivu province.
The city is also considered to be the main place to climb Mount Nyyragongo, one of the cheapest ways to observe Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a vehicle called a boda-bo-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to walk around the goat. If you want to go short, the normal (local) price of the taxi is ~500 Congolese francs.
The word "timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands with its relative improperity. 
Today, Timbuktu is considered a poor city, even if it has become the center of attraction of tourism with its popularity and even has an airport.
As a result of the danger of desert sands, in 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage as a risky monument.

Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northwestern South Africa and extends eastward, Mozambique to the north, along the Zimbabwe border, and the southern border is surrounded by the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-collars, each of which includes a separate wildlife.
Not only is one of the most sights in South Africa, it is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
This park, as is the case with daily protection and entry fees, is available in all National Parks of South Africa.
In addition, it can be useful to buy a Wild Card that provides access to selected parks in South Africa or all National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island has also named the area where it is located, and this area is the main center that attracts the attention of tourists. 
The arrangement of buildings that created Hong Kong's silhouet can be compared to a charming glowing histogram that emerges with the waters of the port of Victoria.
Get out of the island to see the best view of Hong Kong and go to the Kowloon coast ahead.
Much of the urbanization of Hong Kong's island falls to areas that are densely restored along the northern coast.
This is where British colonists have mastered, so if you're looking for evidence about the region's colonial history, you can start here.
Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove region in the world and extends 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundar forest forest in the territory of India, which is included in the UNESCO World Material Heritage List, has been named Sundarban National Park.
In these forests, which are not only made up of mangroves, there are some of the last trees of the mighty jungle that once included the Indo-Gang lowland.
Sundarbans, about 1/3 of which consists of water and wetlands, covering an area of 3850 km2.
Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve since 1966. The area is now believed to have 400 Bengali tigers and about 30 000-pointed deer.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus station located on the side of the river, but many of them, especially those going to the east, and the Jakar/Bumtang bus departs between 06:30 and 07:30.
Interregional buses are usually basbas, so it is recommended that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, convenient and reliable small Japanese remote road buses operate.
Going with a taxi shared to nearby locations such as Paro (U 150) and Punakh (Nu 200), both fast and convenient.
The bridge above the Oyapakk River is a suspension bridge. He cuts the Oyapok River to connect cities in the Brazilian state of Oyapok and Saint-Corce in French Guiana.
The bridge with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.50 m is located between two towers at an altitude of 83 meters.
The vertical gap at the bottom of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened until March 2017.
The launch of the bridge is planned for September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will complete the work. 
The Quaranis were the most important indigenous group currently living in East Pragway as semi-nomadic hunter tribes, engaged in family-agrival farming.
Other indigenous tribes such as Quayjuru and Payagua, who chose the Chako region, were engaged in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant State of India," was formed in the 16th century when Spanish invaders faced with local people.
The period of colonialism of the Spanish lasted 3 centuries.
After the establishment of Paraguay Asunsion in 1537, he was able to maintain his national characteristics and affiliation.
The best polo teams and players in the world are one of the factors that make Argentina famous.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Folkland (FKP) and its value equal to the value of a British pound (GBP).
The money on the islands can only be exchanged in a bank located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
In general, along with the British pound sterling anywhere in the islands, Stanley credit cards and the US dollar are accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on remote islands, but UK and U.S. currencies can be accepted, clarify from the beginning with entrepreneurs what payment system is used in the country you are going to.
Change the currency used in the Falkland Islands before leaving the islands, as it is almost impossible to change the currency outside the islands.
When winter in the northern hemisphere, there is spring in Montevideo south of the equator, and on the contrary, winter is here when summer there is summer.
The Montevideo is located in the subtropical climate zone, and in the summer months the air temperature is usually higher than +30°C.
While the temperature drops below the freezing rate, the wind and humidity together make the thermometer feel colder than the thermometer shows, one or other similar cases indicate that winter cold is deceptive.
Since the amount of rainfall per year is roughly the same, there are no special "rainy" and "dreamm" chapters here. 
Most of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, but nature is still wild, so you can't approach or worry about them.
According to the park management warning, you should stand at least 100 yards /m away from bears and worms, and 25 yards/m away from other wild animals!
Bison, deer, shelter, bears, and almost all large animals may be attacked, no matter how obedient they may appear.
Dozens of visitors who do not have a certain distance each year are injured. Given that these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, it is necessary to maintain distance between them.
In addition, keep in mind that the ability of bears and other animals of wildlife to smell is well developed, so do not carry or cook foods that smell, as well as keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just a little less than 40 000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a place in 1889 that seven ships from Germany, the United States and England refused to leave, with its own sea panic.
All the ships sank, and only one British cruiser left back. About 200 Americans and German lost their lives.
The peaceful assembly organized by the Mau movement in the city during the struggle for independence resulted in the assassination of Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi of the highest rank.
Since the Auckland is located between two ports, there are many beaches here. The most famous are in these three regions.
The Pacific Ocean's "North Shore" beaches ("North Harbour" port) extend south from Devonport to "Long Bay" along the coastline.
All sandy beaches are almost safe for swimming, and pohutukwa trees have created places of grandness on most beaches.
Tamaki Drayv beaches are located near the port of Vaytemata, in the prestige coastal towns of the Mishn Brain and the St. Heliers part of Central Auckland.
There are a lot of shops on the beach, which are also located in the family. It's safe to swim here.
The main local beer with no complex composition, has a pleasant taste and refreshing is called the "Number One." The other is "Manta."
While there are a lot of French wines you can taste, here you will find more New Zealand and Australian wines.
Drinking local tap water is not at all dangerous, if you avoid it, it is also possible to easily get waters sold in bottles.
The concept of "Flet uyet" is alien to Australians. "Espresso" is a dark black shot coffee, a cream-collected drink on cappuccino (not foamy), and tea is served without milk.
You can find hot chocolate that meets true Belgian standards. Although the taste of fruit juices is excellent, the price is expensive.
It has underwater travel all year round, and injuries arising from these reasons are rarely found in underwater cliffs.
In any case, take recommendations from the authorities by following all the rules and paying attention to the signs indicating security warnings.
The jumrumeduzes appear in the north of the province of 1770 in October to April, near the beaches and river basins. They can also be found outside of this period.
Although people are rarely attacked, sharks are present. Most sharks don't swim near them because they are afraid of humans.
Saltwater crocodies that do not lead an active lifestyle in the oceans live mainly in river basins north of Roxampton.
By booking from the beginning, travelers are not worried about accommodation where they will stay.
Tourism agencies usually make contracts with certain hotels, but you can also book other accommodation types, such as camping areas, through a travel agency.
