"One of the windows was finally broken and they began to exit the window," said the surviving Frenchman Koval.
The energy generated when hydrogen atoms combine (or boil) to create more heavier elements cause stars to emit light and heat. 
The project, which scientists are working on, is intended to develop a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
Nevertheless, this is a problem that is not easy to solve, and we will still have to be patient for many years to see the creation of useful heat-nuclear reactors.
If you throw a steel needle into the water, the needle will begin to swim over the water due to surface tension.
The reason for the emergence of surface tension is that the molecules above the water have a stronger effect on each other than the air molecules show to each other.
Water molecules create a transparent skin on the surface of the water, allowing items such as needles to float on the surface of this water.
The knife above the modern ice skates has two edges, between which are tilted inward. Even when the two edges are tilted to the side, it provides more convenient movement in the ice.
Since the lower part is in wave shape, the knife can bent until it touches the ice to one or the other.
This forces the figure to turn back. If the skanes bend to the right, the figure is also tilted to the right, and when the skates bend to the left, the figure will turn to the left in the appropriate order.
They must get rid of the extra energy they receive from light to regenerate their previous energy levels.
They do this by spreading a small light particle called "photon."
This process, which scientists call "stimulated radiation emission," is called because atoms are stimulated by bright light that causes the spread of photone light to the environment, and light itself is a kind of radiation.
The atoms that spread the photo are given in the following way. Undoubtedly, the size of the photos is many times smaller than it actually appears.
The size of the photos is so small that it is also considered smaller than the parts that make up the atom.
The lamp is damaged after the wire in the lamp has been working hundreds of hours, and it burns down.
After that, it is necessary to change the lamp. Be careful when doing this.
First, the light must be turned off or the cable must be removed.
Since electricity flows into the nest where the metal part of the lamp is seated, it may be partially energy left inside the sock. In this case, it is dangerous to touch the inside of the nest or the metal part of the lamp, the case of electric current can occur.
The heart is the most basic organ of the circulatory system, such as the blood-threatening organ.
Blood comes out of the heart through veins called arteries, and through the veins called the vein, it enters the heart. The smallest veins are called capillaries.
Triseratops were such an animal that its teeth were strong enough to crush not only the leaves of the trees, but also fairly hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that tricerops are fed with a plant called sago, which was common in the Clamp period.
These plants are reminiscent of a crowned small palm created by sharp-ended thorny leaves.
Before eating the stem of the plant, Triseratops peel off its leaves with a strong beak.
It is unlikely that dinosaurs will eat these plants, which other scientists claim to be very toxic, but today, as parrots (referring to the dinosaur lineage), melts and other animals feed on poisonous leaves and fruits.
What impact does the gravitational force of Io have on us? If we stand on the surface of Io, we will be lighter than in the world. 
A man weighing 200 feet (90 kg) in the world, is about 36 feet (16 kg) in Io, that is, in this case gravity pulls you lighter.
Since the sun is entirely composed of gases, flames, and plasma, there is no crust on it that you can stand on it like on Earth.
As we move away from the center of the sun, the gas also begins to dilute.
The outer layer, which we see when we look at the sun, called the "light ball," is called a photospher.
About 3000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed that Venus, like a telescope, had phases as the moon.
The phases arise because Venus (or Moon) is illuminated only near the Sun. The phases of Venus confirm the Copernician theory, which claims that planets orbit the Sun.
After some time, in 1639, Jeremiah Horrox, an English astronomer, observed the movement of Venus.

Initially, he called the Khangil alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "appropriate sounds for people to be instructed."
There are a number of theories related to the existence of the Sanskrit language. One of them is related to the Aryan migration from the west to India, which also leads their language to the region where they migrate.
 Sanskrit was an ancient language comparable to the Latin language used in Europe.
The Sanskrit language, in which the first book in the world was written, disappeared due to the hierarchy after the design of Upanishads.
Like Latin, which is the source of French and Spanish languages belonging to the European language group, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is the source of many modern Indian language groups.
With the end of the war for France, Germany was preparing to invade the island of Britain.
Germany called the operation the "Lion of the Sea." When it was withdrawn from Dunkerk, the British army left most of its heavy weapons and supplies, and thus the army was very weak.
But the Royal Navy was still stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegmarine") and was capable of destroying any invasion fleet that came with the La Mansh Canal.
However, the admirals were close to the areas of supposed occupation, because the admirals feared that ships would sink by airstrikes by airstrikes by the Germans.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans, which is considered the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
Although they had developed four new ships before the war began, they had a weak army and a fleet.
Italy needed a plect where its troops could start attacking the main target of African countries, so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For this, they were thinking of getting rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Italy's warships should have done nothing more than that.
A little bit about Japan, Japan was an island state like Britain.
The submarines are ships that can swim under the water and stay there for a long time.
The submarines used in World War I and II were very slow at the time and had a very limited firing range.
When the war just began, submarines, mostly wandering over the water, began to come underwater to avoid visibility as the radar system developed and more precisely.
The Germans, who had submarines called "U-boats," were professional in the management of navigation and submarines.
Due to the success of the Germans in the field of submarines, they are not trusted to have a large number of submarines.
Yes! In modern times, one of the most well-known among the kings of ancient Egypt was King Tutankhamun, called "King Tut" or "King Boy."

The invention of discs with miles turned Assyria's two-wheeled traitor carriage into a more lighter and faster means of warfare, capable of overcoming soldiers and other chariots.
About 1000 years before our era, the Assyrians created the first cavalry. The arrows that come out of their deadly bowes can pierce the armor of enemy soldiers.
The cavalry is part of the army fighting on horseback. Since the saddle was not yet invented, the cavalry of the Assyrian army was sitting on saddle horses and fighting.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. It is likely that the most famous personality of this culture, the author of two masterpieces, Illiada and Odysseya, is the legendary blind poet Homer.
Sophocles and Aristofan, whose works are considered the pearls of world literature, remain the famous playwrights today.
Pythagoras, which we know for its theories about the connections of the edges of the rectangle, is another of the famous Greeks.
Although there are different opinions about how many people in the world speak Hindi, it is likely that this language is among the most widely spoken languages 2 and 4.
The number of key users of the language differs depending on whether very close dialects are also taken into account and not received.
The number of people who can speak this language is estimated to be about 340 million million, but about 800 million people understand that language.
Handwriting, but those who speak Hindi and Urdu, whose vocabulary composition is similar to each other, understand each other in daily communication.
Northern Estonia is heavily covered by Germany's great cultural influence in the nearly 15th century.
Some German monks created the literary Estonian language because they wanted to bring God closer to the local people.
It was based on the German alphabet, the only difference was that it had the letter "Õ/õ".
Over time, many of the words taken from the German language were combined, and thus the process of enlightenment began.
It became a tradition for the heir to go to military service directly.

To create interactive media, it is necessary to acquire conventional and traditional skills, as well as use learned tools in interactive classes (e.g., making story sketches, editing audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
The interactive layout requires you to re-evaluate your thoughts about media production and learn a nonlinear way of thinking.
Interactive design requires the intrication of components of a project to be linked to each other, but at the same time not losing its expression.
The drawback of magnitude lenses is that the focus complexity required to achieve the focal distance range, and the number of elements in the objective, is much more than the basic lenses.
Such a problem is unlikely to occur, as manufacturers in the production of lenses achieve higher standards.
Compared to the effect of stable focal photoobjectives, this allows variable focal-distance photoobjectives to take better-quality images.
Another weakness of changing focus photoobjectives is that the maximum aperture (speed) of these photo objects is usually lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap magnifying photoobjectives in unfluished poor-light conditions.
One of the most common problems we face when turning the film into a DVD format is overskan.
Most of the TVs are designed in such a way that the audience will like.
Therefore, everything you see on the TV has its own frames cut from the top, bottom and edge.
This is to make sure that the image occupies the entire screen and is called overskan.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, it's likely that the edges of the movie will narrow down, and if there are subtitles very close to the bottom of the video, they won't be visible either.
Traditional medieval castle has long been inspired by imaginations with battle tournaments, banquets and Arthur's knighthood images.
It is enough to stand in the middle of millennial ruins to remember the sounds and smells of prolonged wars that have been going on, to hear the sound of horse nalls approaching on the sidewalks, and to feel the fears rising from the basement gaps.
So how realistic is our imagination? Why were the castles built in the first stage? What do we know about layout and construction rules?
The Bridge-Maxlo Castle is a typical fortification-type mansion of the time rather than a real castle.
In the face of such a decisive attack, its large glass windows and thin walls would not be able to stand for longer.
In the 1480s, when it began to be built by Lord Hastings, the country was more peaceful and only needed protection against small usurpers groups.
European nations and all European states are trying to maintain their national sovereignty, taking advantage of the balance of power.
The fact that all European peoples were forced to prevent the strongness of a nation, and therefore, in most cases, the change of allies in order to maintain proportionality of national governments was the basis of this concept.
The first war with a balance of power was the War of Success in Spain.
This was considered a significant change, and thus the thirty-Year-Old War went down in history as the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC as a result of a fire caused by Herostrate.

In a unique situation, mysticism can differ from other forms of religious faith and obedience, as a person emphasizes the experience or marvelousness of a person in a unique state.
The religion of Sikhism belongs to the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, within the framework of Hindu traditions.
While they accept Hindu roots and traditions, the Cys see their beliefs as a religion separate from Hinduism. 
Those who worship the religion of Sighism call their religion a Qur'an that means "the path of land" in Punjab. While land is a fundamental factor in all Indian religions, Sighism is a very important factor that shapes the foundation of faith in the religion. 
The foundation of this religion was laid by the Gur Nanak (1469–1539) in the 15th century. Then his nine successors continued to do so after another.
However, Khrushev's words were tested in June 1956, when workers turned into a common protest against communism, where workers opposed food shortages and wages.

The Indo-WALLE Cultural culture was the culture of the Bronze Age on the lower continent of northwestern India, covering most regions of modern-west Pakistan, many regions in northwestern India and northeast Afghanistan.
Civilization originated in the Indian River basin, and it took its name from here.
Some scholars argue that it would be more correct to call it the Indo-Saraswati culture, respectively, as it is a culture in the basins of the starred Saraswati River, and some of them to call it a Cultural Culture of Harappa, one of the first places where excavations were applied in 1920.
The military nature of the Roman Empire helped to improve the medical field.
Emperor Augustus began to hire medicines, and even they created the first Roman Health Union, which they could benefit after the war.
Surgeons had knowledge of the variety of painkillers, including the morphine and black batbat plant derived from the extract of poppy seeds.
They were experienced in amputation to save patients from gangrene, but also in the application of turn-ke-up and arterial compressions to prevent bleeding.
The Roman Empire, which has led to great achievements in the field of medicine for centuries, is the author of much of the knowledge that is known to us today.
In the art of Pureland origami, paper can only be folded once, it is forbidden to fold more, more difficult movements such as folding on the opposite side are not allowed, and the locations of all folding are flat. 
This was created by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced paper folders or limited motor skills.
The level of awareness of race and racist stereotypes develops in children in a way that is appropriate for their age, and these racial stereotypes affect their behavior.
For example, when children learn that there is a stereotype about the race minority they belong to, such as that they do not perform well in school, they begin to not really show good results in school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and has 54 million profiles in the current period.
Such websites, most of all, have caused great interest in the education sector.
There are also positive aspects of these websites that can create a group of pages that incorporate blogs, videos, images and other functions in a simple way.
This page can easily be easily accessed by providing only one web address. In this case, it is easier to remember and write for students who have difficulty writing on a keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized for easier reading, it can be used more or less than color according to your request.
Attention Disorder Disorder "is a neurological syndrome with classic three-step signs, including non-willful movement, distraction, hyperactivity, or excessive energy".
It's not a learning inability, it's about 3-5 percent of all children, which is probably 2 million children in America. 
It is difficult for children with hyperactivity and attention dispersal syndrome to pay attention to things like school assignments, but they are able to pay more comfortable attention to things they like, such as playing games and watching their favorite cartoons and writing sentences without leaving punctuations.
Since the brains of these types of children can not be stimulated in normal ways, they tend to exhibit problematic behaviors such as "dangerous actions, fight with others, challenge power" to send signals to their brains.
Hyperactivity and attention dispersal syndrome affect children's relationships with other peers, so it is difficult for their peers to understand why they behave in such a way, why they write such writings, or why the level of maturity is different in them.
The ability to gain and learn knowledge, as it has been mentioned before, changes the basic level of knowledge gained.
The approach of obtaining information was different. Reminding something in the individual by putting pressure on something was not included in this approach, but the main focus was on the ability to remember the text.
In itself, Renaissance has brought important innovations to the field of teaching and knowledge distribution.
Hominids that do not use their hands while moving, carrying something heavy or passing through trees, are different from other primats due to this feature.
The hand and leg of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length. This shows that the main burden falls on the hands of the chimpanzee when folding your hands inward and walking.
A man's hand is shorter than his foot, and his fingers are more straight.
The fossil hand bones, which are two, three million years old, show the transition from motion to manipulation in the process of forming the hand.
Some people believe that a lot of understanding sleep, which is created artificially, can be exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that prolong the duration between REM states.
Fast eye movements that shrink at night show that you are really asleep and that when your body restores itself, it moves too slowly that it will not cause a problem.
It's as exhausting as getting up in a dream every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on what time the brain sleeps quickly throughout the night.
The Italians in North Africa did not come before. Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, and a week later, in Libya, the Fort Kapuzzo fortress was captured by the British 11th Hashart cavalry regiment.

Perhaps the most common type of tourism is recreational tourism, which is associated with human travel.
This happens when people go to places that are dramatically different from their daily lives for recreation and entertainment.

The study found that depression, fear, and disaster are among the causes that lead to pain and disability in people suffering from lower back pain.
Not depression and fear, but only the effects of a catastrophic event were the subject that was definitely touched upon in regular "Physical Activity" sessions, which are organized on a weekly basis.
Those who from time to time were more likely to have a sense of chronic pain and anxiety, which differs from normal physical movement, more support associated with negative pain perception.
Eye or vision depends on sensitive organs of the visual system or the eyes. 
Due to the requirements of the body, there are many different types of eye shapes in different colors.
Different constructions have different skills with different wavelengths sensitive and different degrees of sharpness, as well as they require different processing processes and different numbers for optimal work to understand the information included. 
The population is a collection of creatures from special categories in the given geographical region.
All individuals entering the same population are called monomorphic when they are similar from a certain phenotypic sign point of view.
People who are considered polymorphic show several forms of a particular feature.
They also march the ant colonies that resemble the army and nest in different phases.
At the stage of migration, the ants move in rows at night, and during the day they stop to camp.
When the food supply in their hands is exhausted, the herd goes to a nomadic lifestyle. At this stage, the herds are making new temporary nests that they change every day.
Such nomadic anger or the duration of the marches in flocks is about 17 days.
What is the meaning of the cell? The term cellular derives from the Latin word "cella", which means "little room", which means "little room", which was first used by a microscopist who studied the shape of a fungus.
 Cells are the basis of living things, and all organisms are formed from one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and critical for the study of living things that they call them "the cornerstones of life."
In order for the blood circulation to continue without disturbance, the nervous system sends nerve signals through the body, protects homeostasis.

I believe that most people will understand that the best long-term opportunity for them is to work with others.
Most people live with the desire to travel to stars to discover other planets, while others believe that living things or aliens live on other planets.
Since the stars are spreading to a wide area, there are trillions of miles between even "neighbor" stars. Therefore, if this happens once, it will probably not be repeated for a long time. 
Who knows, when your grandchildren are studying their ancestors, maybe they will be on another alien planet?
Animals have many cells. They digest what they eat inside. Most animals are moving.
The difference between animals is that they have brains (in fact, not all animals, for example, there is no brain in jellyfish).
lives all over the world. They can dig the soil under it, fly in the oceans and in the air.
The main structure and the smallest functional unit of living organisms are the cell.

Robert Huck, a biologist from England, saw small squares in it while observing the fungus with a microscope.
He was the first person to observe dead cells. They were like rooms.
The transition from one case to another and the fact that the passing time does not change is a property of elements and compounds.
Nitrogen has the same properties in gas, as in liquid form, but although it is denser in liquid form, its molecules still remain the same.
The other of the samples is water. Water is generated from a combination of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.
Its molecular shape is the same as gas, liquid or solid.
Its chemical condition remains the same without depending on the change of its physical condition.
Time is a factor that happens around us and affects everything we do, but it is difficult to fully understand it.
For thousands of years, studies related to religion, philosophy and scientists have been carried out over time.
When we live, we are moving forward against the background of events that have passed through the future and the past.
In addition, time is a method of comparing the time (how long it takes) of events. 
By analyzing how the events are repeated, you can also determine the time transition yourself. Periodic events are regular repetitive events.

The forms of thinking that at some point combine is a method of problem solving that brings together different ideas or areas to find a solution to the problem.
This is the basis of the way of thinking, agility, logic and fluency, in addition, the identification of factors, the re-testing of existing methods and collecting information.
The most important factor of this way of thinking is that there is only one answer here. You only think about two answers from one straight or one that is wrong.
This kind of thinking is related to certain scientific or ordinary processes.
People who have this type of thinking about logical thinking have a high ability to remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific test patterns.

Felix Bloch (University of Stanford) and Edward Parcel (University of Harvard) are based on a physical event called the MRI nuclear magnetic resonance discovered in the 1930s.
Magnetic field and radio waves ensure that atoms produce small radio-signals in this resonance.
Doctor and research scientist Reymond Damadyan discovered the basis of the use of magnetic resonance in 1970 as a medical diagnosis tool.
4 years later, a patent was issued in the field of MRI as the world's first patent.
In 1977, the deceased completed the first "whole body" MRI observation device, which he gave the name Damadian "Inevitible."
It takes time to communicate unsynchronous, think, and react to others.
This allows students to work at their own time at a reasonable pace and monitor the pace of the teaching information.
In addition, there is also the possibility of changing working hours and less time constraints (Bremer, 1998).

The transition from absolute principles to free principles is ensured in the postmodern approach. The way of science is not one.
Learning has no only purpose. The learning process arises in the experience between the student and the knowledge given.
All our current "self-edit" and "present information" teaching-based television shows express this idea.
Most of us feel that from time to time we are obsessed with a TV program that will never work for, or whether we learn, or a TV show that tells us about the process.
