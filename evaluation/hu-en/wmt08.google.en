European inflation slipped on food
The accelerating inflation measured in the Eurozone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The November price increase in the 13 countries of the euro zone was greater than expected, after the 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 percent was registered, the Union&#39;s statistical office in Luxembourg reported.
The official forecast made only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, did not cut the key interest rate, saying that the reduction would lead to the formation of an inflationary spiral together with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to it.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of twenty-two: inflation must be &quot;talked down&quot; so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the November inflation rate of 3.3 percent is considered a twelve-year record; In Spain, it rose to 4.1 from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation was driven high by rising food and energy prices.
Wheat futures were up 88 percent, and soybean prices also hit their highest since 1973.
You also had to pay significantly more for cooking oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from this year&#39;s 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but will decrease to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation level will remain around 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz&#39;s circle of supporters grew significantly by the beginning of December, so it now has the largest base since 2002, while Gallup had never measured socialist support this low before, at 13 percent.
Among sure party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) compared to one-fifth (20 percent) of support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support among the entire population is two percent.
Among the sure-voting party respondents, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic public sentiment has deteriorated even further to the previous low point - it has never been this high, 41 percent of those who considered the country&#39;s economic situation to be very bad, while another 46 percent said that the situation is quite bad.
After the more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, the families are again more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth of the population expects improvement.
In December, more people than in any previous survey by Gallup, 71 percent of the respondents, believed that the prime minister does his job more poorly than well.
13 percent of those polled trust or very much trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all, 27 percent trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of society thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be handled without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 percent thought it desirable for the government and the prime minister to remain, this percentage is currently only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the only solution in calling new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of the respondents answered the question about their intention to participate that they would definitely go, and another 20 percent said that they would probably go.
By way of comparison, only 55 percent would definitely participate in a &quot;national assembly election to be held this Sunday&quot; and another 15 percent consider their participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be in question based on current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent to visiting fees, and 84 percent to hospital daily fees.
If we look at the same ratios only among those who have confirmed their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visiting fees and hospital daily fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco raised it by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained last year&#39;s average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that the VAT did not increase this year.
An article from Napi Gesdaság
This year, Napi&#39;s usual Christmas basket in the Budaörs shopping triangle increased by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets the value increased by well over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in grocery stores already &quot;flew away&quot; in December last year, there was no drastic price increase compared to the previous high base.
But it is obviously terrifying for consumers that what they could get for less than nine thousand forints last year, now they can&#39;t even get it for ten thousand.
Napi&#39;s basket exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 forints in the analyzed hypermarkets by at least HUF 91.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year&#39;s level, but turkey breast fillets, walnuts and poppy seeds also rose in price.
The prices of flour and bread in stores followed the data of the KSH, although we found a kilogram of bread at Auchan for HUF 139.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter returnable bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so even with the deposit fee, they only asked for 257 forints for the product.
However, this year, Auchan was the most expensive in Napi&#39;s basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year&#39;s Christmas prices, Cora increased the prices in the Napi basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 percent each.
Comparing last year&#39;s most expensive and this year&#39;s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year&#39;s cheapest and this year&#39;s most expensive is 21 percent.
The increase was HUF 1,480 on average.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1,206, so that the VAT increase had an impact on prices last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, as it was obvious that the department stores could not decide how much margin to apply to each product, as they were unable to calculate what effect the price change would have on consumption.
(If the rotation speed of a product is poorly planned by the trader, it can seriously benefit from the margin adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
Due to the VAT, the price increase of Napi&#39;s basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive was HUF 1,720 more than the 2006 value, while the price difference for the cheapest was only HUF 844.
This year, this extreme did not show itself, since the most expensive one was HUF 1,630 more than last year, and the cheapest also went up by HUF 1,284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months, the prices of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent.
(By the way, this does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: the statistical office measured a price increase of more than 30 percent in the case of some basic foodstuffs in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour as well as with eggs.)
According to Napi kosara, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the already quite expensive product last year produced a price increase of just over 10 percent even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg suppliers, and the supermarkets also managed to beat the drastic price increase.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
According to our experience, the majority of customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, and carry long-lasting food in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, serious queues formed in front of the cash registers in all three stores, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
But we know that traffic is less in the countryside, and more multinationals complain to research companies that their income falls short of their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of consumer durables.
Many places save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The sanitary conditions of the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, and the overload of the staff are not conducive to stopping infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
An MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the trauma department of the János hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man admitted after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same location earlier this year.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon after he had to return with an MRSA infection, and since then an important operation could not be performed because of the bacteria in his body.
This year, until December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department at the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were definitely registered in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be easily cured.
However, when antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics, which can spread rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Primarily when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning - sepsis - in weakened, elderly or underweight patients.
According to the medical director of János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resistant to antibiotics
&quot;We isolate such patients, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics to treat them,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are examined from the outset to see if MRSA is present in their bodies, but infection cannot always be avoided even in this way.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favorable for preventing the development and spread of multiresistant pathogens, claims Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor incoming patients and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests also plays a role in this.
Most cases thus come to light when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief physician of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to the drugs, but hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often spread from one patient to another by healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the wards are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, even though from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina Böröcz noted, it can also be seen that in hospitals with unfavorable financial conditions, they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses, and many patients, so the chance of infections is even greater.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are observed, there are demonstrably fewer such infections, or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection causes huge expenses for health insurance companies, so they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, e.g. the government included the prevention and reduction of MRSA in its program.
According to the indications, the program is successful, based on the published data, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
Among the priorities of the European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) is the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert opinion of the XXII. in the case of a fatal accident caused by a district police captain.
It can be ruled out that XXII, who resigned from his post in the meantime, would have driven drunk or in an intoxicated state. district police captain, who ran over a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the Metropolitan Prosecutor&#39;s Office, on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter had been prepared.
The expert opinion supported the primary investigation result, which already established that the former police captain did not consume alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The XXII. the head of the district headquarters at the time with his own car in the XXII. On Tuesday, he hit a 55-year-old man walking in front of him while turning on Kossuth Lajos Street in the district, who did not want to cross the designated pedestrian crossing to the other side of the roadway.
(The latter, i.e. the fact that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra crossing, is otherwise not a mitigating circumstance based on the rules of the KRESZ, the turning car must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked to be retired, according to the police, because he was so shaken by the incident.
The Budapest Investigative Prosecutor&#39;s Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also touched on the fact that the former police chief cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, vice president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit framework agreements with a total value of 400 million euros supporting education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure, and energy in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Development Bank (EIB) approved a budget of 300 million euros for Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental protection projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, of which the parties had already signed a loan agreement for 100 million euros, the contract signed now is the remaining 200 million euros about its use.
The 150 million euro loan agreement also serves the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining 150 million euros can be used later, by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth 50 million euros, which the budget uses primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
Metro 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of the metro&#39;s financing with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to János Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of 8.4 billion euros.
The interest on the loans is tied to EURIBOR, with an 8-year grace period and without a holding commission, provided by the EIB.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU&#39;s still cheapest but rapidly rising market?
Analysis of Re/Max&#39;s Bulgarian division.
The most popular Eastern European real estate destination right now is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski resorts and beach houses.
Among the mountains, the most fashionable are the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the coast, Albena, the &quot;Golden Coast&quot;, the &quot;Sunny Coast&quot;, the ancient Szozopol and Neszebár, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will attract the interest of investors as well - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are buying in the especially cheap area of Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also promises attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe, making it a top destination in the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in bulk, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups - says Georgij Yankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between 50,000 and 100,000 euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5,000 to 15,000 euros and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, and proximity to a big city, shops and, in general, the local doctor are important to them.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital continues to rise, as demand is getting stronger.
Although property prices in Bulgaria are the lowest in the European Union, they have increased by 21 percent per year over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices basically exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Affairs Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the discussion of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the discussion of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to follow the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
Currently, there is a heated debate about this between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently wish to discuss exact numbers, although it is leaning towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big question of the conference is whether the developed countries undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the subsidies to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be part of the UN&#39;s Global Environmental Protection Fund (GEF), according to Market and Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Affairs Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU&#39;s efforts to maintain its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU undertakes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to the 1990 level by 2020, regardless of the success of concluding the &quot;post-2012 agreement&quot;, and is ready to undertake a reduction of up to 30 percent, in the event that the other large developed regions of the world, as well as developing countries, are also willing to undertake obligations in accordance with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol set a total reduction of 5.2 percent, within which the EU - then still 15 member states - undertook minus 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent in 1985-87. compared to the period between, which our country will fulfill. - reminds the press release of the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the necessity of which was pointed out by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body dealing with climate change, in its latest report.
This would delay emission reductions and make it inevitable that the Earth&#39;s average temperature would rise above 2 degrees Celsius, which would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British army units are posting footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video sharing site to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to get onto YouTube: the special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken with a miniature camera mounted on a helmet, are checked at the air force&#39;s operational headquarters in Kandahar, and then sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
139 recordings of Air Force soldiers have already been uploaded to the Internet in this form, and their &quot;channel&quot; has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered as &quot;defenceheadquarters&quot; in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraq and Afghanistan operations, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally put up the videos for recruiting purposes, and the Defense Department says it&#39;s also good for informing the general public about the true purpose of the military&#39;s presence abroad.
Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC that the propaganda published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements, but it inevitably carries some political message, as it justifies the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government in a special way.
The Americans made a game
The army is also troubled by the fact that, in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are also uploaded to the sharing site, which for example show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, &quot;official&quot; propaganda films, the officers talk as much as possible about the losses, but do not show them the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already appeared on the Internet, which were made during live deployments, but the British army only recently found out about them.
The Americans recruit in a slightly different way, with the free-to-download shooting game called America&#39;s Army, in which the player can get into the shoes of the soldiers in a more or less realistic simulation.
It&#39;s going to be a raucous and scone-filled Christmas at the ministries
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem emotional: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end meeting for her employees, who will say goodbye to 2007 with scones and coffee.
There are ministries where there will be a party with live music, in other ministries they will create a Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of the officials with raffles and toasts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets - this is how the authorities have fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of National Defense is holding the largest ministerial Christmas party this year, but the HM is not expecting the ministry&#39;s employees.
On the Orphans&#39; Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, on the Mission Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are entertained, and a press reception is also organized.
The ministry allocates 25 million for the end-of-year mood.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of the loop compared to other ministries.
The GKM party will be held in Jövő Háza, for a total of HUF 4,320,000, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred ministry employees.
At the ministry&#39;s celebration, they will stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but there will be performers and a raffle.
The NFÜ&#39;s Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized in the building of the National Judicial Council (OIT) on Wednesday - there were also concerts and dinner.
The hall pass cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We understand that one of the NFÜ&#39;s departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Center, with EU funds.
The Vígszínház building was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt, as we were unable to reach the person in charge.
You don&#39;t need a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which organized a St. Luke&#39;s Day ball on December 7th instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money for the use of the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with a greeting from the minister, and after dinner you could dance to prelude music.
In response to [origo]&#39;s question, it was announced that evening dresses or suits were not mandatory at the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Local Government is organizing a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and celebration for the employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth, on the other hand, is not officially expecting her colleagues for a Christmas party, but for a year-end meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected, who - the press department announced - will only get coffee and scones, so the party will cost HUF 350,000.
On the other hand, Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas gathering in its own large hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
HUF 2,500 per guest is set aside for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Ever since János Veres has been the minister, the employees of the PM have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, the officiality is reinforced not only by the minister&#39;s speech, but also by the afternoon date.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20, the ministerial Christmas will not be held.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyadvár, in the Városliget, and according to the ministry, HUF 1,000 per person will be allocated to the hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are authorized.
These receptions, organized every year, begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a low-key snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture will not hold a Christmas party at all - the relevant press departments informed [origo].
The press department could not tell the price of the official Christmas of the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
Every evening, more than four hundred people were invited to the party, which is organized in the Museum of Industrial Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Association of Workers&#39; Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate Monday&#39;s indefinite strike.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and the work stoppage will begin on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will be almost completely stopped, and there will also be a strike at BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present the details of Monday&#39;s strike organized jointly with the National Federation of Workers&#39; Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday&#39;s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday the organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date was set for the end of the strike that had started - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If, however, the legislation is approved, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
Based on the Parliament&#39;s agenda for Monday, it is also conceivable that the health insurance law will be voted on only late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions in transport can be expected: work on the railway will be suspended for an indefinite period, part of Budapest&#39;s public transport and more than half of the Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, there will be half-track road closures in many parts of the country.
The strike call was joined by many trade unions and NGOs, the list of which is constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others announced a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, even though more and more people are traveling by train as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to reports so far, there will be a strike at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Heat Industry Trade Unions will hold a four-hour strike, the Teachers&#39; Trade Union has called for a 2- and 2-8-hour work stoppage, and Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide, at alternating times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) belonging to SZEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and to release a new concept for public debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new pension calculation method due next year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of joining the system even before 2010 for deserving jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the Liga Trade Unions, does not accept the Ministry of Economy and Transport&#39;s offer for the railway wing lines, and is waiting for a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increased the country&#39;s risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year with the support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several aspects.
In the company&#39;s &quot;risk warning&quot;, it was written that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that &quot;with the worsening of the ethnic tension that already exists between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may even develop in the short term&quot;.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard&#39;s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, all of this can be traced back to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: &quot;the public discussion of the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extreme political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Gypsy-Hungarian conflict&quot;.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, as a result of the great domestic and international media attention, &quot;significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the country&#39;s stability and democratic development&quot;.
They remind you: as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which gained more and more publicity and momentum starting from the fall of 2006, several organizations calling themselves &quot;national self-defense&quot; associations were founded in Hungary in the summer of 2007.
&quot;The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly promoting the preparation of their members - even armed - for defense (disaster prevention, national defense, law enforcement) tasks, in addition citing the incompetence of the police, the army, that is, the state,&quot; they added.
It was noted: all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on society&#39;s opposition to politics and parties, tries to put various political aspirations in a civil guise.
The emphasis on civility and the association form is therefore not only used to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration in the case of these associations, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Magyar Gárda is a risk-increasing factor for neighborhood relations as well.
&quot;In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighboring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region,&quot; they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is based on the mass Roma riots that broke out in a quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
Taking advantage of this, the BNU decided to establish the Guard, saying that the purpose of the organization is &quot;national self-defense&quot;.
According to them, &quot;Gypsy terror&quot; has been experienced in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - reminds Political Capital.
They added: the initiative caused a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will create their own guard as a form of resistance indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Roma in Hungary will respond to the threat in a similar way by organizing their own self-defense - reads the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, told the telegraph office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holiday is not a red letter everywhere
In Hungary, the law clearly indicates the days marked in red, and it has already become common practice to rearrange working days around holidays, of which there will be fewer next year.
The holiday is not the same in the EU and America either.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly associated with church holidays and significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year here: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are both holidays - the latter just so that New Year&#39;s Eve people can relax.
By the way, we have a total of eleven red-letter holidays throughout the year.
March 15 commemorating the 1848 revolution and October 23, as well as the commemoration day of the 1956 revolution, are national holidays.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, we celebrate work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day holidays.
Since, according to the calendar, our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red letter holiday.
It is true that the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work and school on the preceding Saturdays.
For many years, the Minister of Labor has regulated in a separate decree when exactly the day immediately preceding or following the holiday must be worked.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, public employees and those in public service.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions that operate without interruption and, due to their purpose, also operate on public holidays.
This year, the work schedule will only be changed around the year-end holidays: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, as experience shows that the majority of people &quot;skip&quot; the days between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve, or use their saved vacation time for this purpose.
Next year, several of our holidays will fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer working day shifts than this year.
First, the calendar changes around Labor Day, so that workers can stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
The other transfer is related to the October 23 holiday: you will have to work on October 18, Saturday, instead of Friday the 24th.
However, the end of the year can be spent completely in the spirit of the holiday next year, since from December 24 almost everywhere there will be a non-stop break, even if New Year&#39;s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six discouraging little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemail messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost don&#39;t even notice anymore: these &quot;color&quot; the everyday at work.
It is a question of whether you get used to small inconveniences or whether you put on the gloves and consciously avoid situations that are misunderstood and cause annoyance to others.
Tips.
&quot;Sorry, I forgot to tell you that I was contacted by the marketing department,&quot; says one of your colleagues.
How did you miss a meeting because of this?
At best, you&#39;ll regret it and try to make it right, maybe call the marketing department to tell them you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before making an awkward apology, it&#39;s worth thinking about what you can do to make your colleagues uncomfortable, and make a conscious effort to avoid it.
Borrowing something you don&#39;t own?
There is nothing more annoying than when you reach for a document, stationery or your phone, and it is nowhere to be found.
Do you remember that yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but in the morning it was broken?
Perhaps you discover your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don&#39;t take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightfully be angry with you for stealing their property.
Don&#39;t put office envelopes or post-it notes in your pocket, because it can be unpleasant if it runs out before time, and you need it right away.
Do you gossip about your colleagues&#39; private lives?
There is no good way to stop a rumor that is already spreading.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don&#39;t share your information (assumptions) about the private lives of your colleagues!
If one of them shares their innermost secrets with you, don&#39;t abuse their trust!
Bury what you heard and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others also know about the things your colleague is wearing.
Are you calling in sick for no reason?
When you call the office and call in sick citing a splitting headache because you feel bad or feel like you&#39;d rather rest that day; think about the fact that someone else has to do your work, urgent tasks, and deadline tasks for you.
Don&#39;t mess with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be in the office the next day, or something may come up that requires you to stay at home, let your colleagues and your boss know that you are not there the next day.
Burping, giggling, calling
Are you engrossed in your work, but the giggles of your colleagues pull you out of it?
Have you inadvertently overheard a phone conversation that would have been better left unheard?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, talking loudly (which you carry on above their heads), nor by stomping your feet, continuous swearing, or loud displeasure.
All of these can be confusing, even if they don&#39;t delve into a particular project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If you don&#39;t have time for something, you forgot to send an important letter or message, don&#39;t blame someone else for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to the chaos in the office or your loud colleagues!
Admit it if you made a mistake and someone else suffered a disadvantage from it, and eliminate the flaw!
Ask how you can correct your mistake, make up for the omission!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Teddy bear pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office!
Don&#39;t wear comfortable casual clothes even if your job allows it!
Don&#39;t be a slob, respect your colleagues and yourself by going to the office in casual clothes - if your job requires it, neatly and elegantly!
If you want to answer, you are no longer interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic jam.
A special tune plays from the radio: the sound of a violin accompanied by electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
The music changes tempo and the bass joins the previous tones, and then a female choir joins in as a real gem.
Zagar&#39;s song &quot;Wings of Love&quot; is playing on mr2.
For a long time, the domestic music scene did not spoil us much with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the plug is quite different if you listen to the new Zagar record.
The emergence of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions emerging from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and even though garage rock with guitar strums is in vogue again, domestic electropop also proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs and played in Yonderboi&#39;s band himself, until - perhaps because two pipers couldn&#39;t fit in a tavern - he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, and pop, he began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török Season).
His formations, which initially played in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important domestic records and declared Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to be almost the only domestic trendsetters who seem marketable in the West.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his band became &quot;trendy&quot;, but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early years in Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer&#39;s old band there.
We would be right with the airy, flying reference, but in addition to the airiness of the music, the influence of louder guitars and rock and roll became apparent - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time.
The singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, performed in these songs at the Millennium premiere of the record.
The album also produced a real hit on the radio, mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to night, began to sneak into the ears the large-scale melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian female singers (&quot;Underground Divas&quot;).
So everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit song now raises the question: how much of the layered music you play is left?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layered music doesn&#39;t mean much to me.
I think there are two types of light music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless and just as well prepared for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from honest motives.
The welcoming attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, there are greater traditions of light music.
Not only the ten- and twenty-year-old age group go to concerts there, but also older people.
They are more likely to monitor the changes in popular music around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Here, music is born not for a purpose, but for some kind of reason.
The role of the audience can be felt more at concerts, where the influence on each other already works, but this only lies in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I have noticed that if you try to please the audience, then you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you plan to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He works solo and built his career further west than us.
Zs.B.: We don&#39;t really follow his path, regardless of the fact that sometimes they try to explain this in our music.
We are more team players who trust in the other&#39;s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi&#39;s music, since several of us left his band and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: On mr2&#39;s Petőfi top list, Wings of Love took first place.
Many people heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this track.
Did you consciously open up to a wider audience with the more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn&#39;t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the record with it.
This song is about more.
We intended it to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to resolve the vocal orgy and the more difficult topics on the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That&#39;s when the idea came to put together this choir from the good-sounding soloists of our own domestic music scene.
That&#39;s how the six-member choir came together - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you plan the song just like that or did the girls perform it?
Zs.B.: The track has existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and when the material for the album was assembled, we thought that this track needed something more.
The chord progression attracted him to add a vocal part to it.
That same night, I sang the melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came almost at first and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember it was very electrifying at the time, but of course you needed the Divas.
It wouldn&#39;t have worked as powerfully with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and in the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There are no solos (except for Judy Jay&#39;s short solo), they don&#39;t have their own parts, they sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so the music doesn&#39;t just accompany their singing.
They also stood at the back of the stage.
Is this intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was purely due to technical problems.
On the other hand, it is conscious that we did not want to share solo roles.
The track is also about this, to forget our ego a little, who came from where, where we are going, just let those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work with the most?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, there were actually more difficult pieces with none of them, but rather with the mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma, in which I play on a competition piano, or Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn&#39;t want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything fell into place, like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite track from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with concerts and the fact that I have already &quot;released&quot; the record.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
A disloyal embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banking giant Sociéte Générale, calls its former employee Jerome Kerviel that way.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not at all untalented, was more of a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, it recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
&quot;He has a reduced mental capacity,&quot; said his superiors who notified the police.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel&#39;s testimony reveals that at the end of last year, he made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
&quot;I just wanted to make money for my bank,&quot; he claims in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He sensed the opportunity already at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages granted to customers with low incomes or those with a history of repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe in this and bet on a good horse.
Its year-end profit reached 1.6 billion euros.
&quot;Even when I earned the first half a billion, I didn&#39;t know how to announce it,&quot; admits Kerviel, adding that he didn&#39;t keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that it could not be found out.
He also managed to outwit his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange also became interested in his deals.
Risk was gain
Were you afraid that everything would be revealed?
Rather not.
&quot;I thought that just the fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would appease them.&quot;
How did you have the willpower to risk so much?
He reached his position gradually.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already a broker&#39;s assistant, and he became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of 90,000 dollars a year.
Still, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
&quot;In 2005, I already knew during my first conversation that they looked at me with a bad eye.
Also because of my qualifications, professional and personal development,&quot; Kerviel told investigators.
The first big success came not long after his entry.
He made money thanks to Allianz shares, as he bet half a billion euros on the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And that started an avalanche - he wanted more.
We&#39;ll leave you alone while you search
&quot;It&#39;s like a snowball,&quot; he told police.
But his bosses allegedly knew about everything, or rather guessed.
&quot;While I was making money, they turned a blind eye.&quot;
However, at the beginning of the year, disaster struck.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to take a shower.
When he started work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
He became a suspect because of his freedom.
&quot;Last year I only took four days off.
A broker who doesn&#39;t have freedom is a broker who doesn&#39;t want anyone looking at his reports,&quot; Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic stands a chance of obtaining 365 billion
The ministers of the Czech government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programs from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic could obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Around 125 billion kroner will be allocated to the regions from seven operational programs.
Czech companies will be able to obtain an amount of around 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, goes to transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22 percent of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneur and Innovation Program helps entrepreneurs and companies obtain funds for innovation ventures.
The company should acquire resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful of the newly admitted countries in obtaining funding from EU funds.
The court approved the twenty-year prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeals approved a twenty-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the country&#39;s former president, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial frauds amounting to 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
According to the AP news agency, it is not yet clear whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be back behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison management whether Alemán will be allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán regularly transferred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were subsequently transferred to a foundation that Alemán established to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget was approved
That&#39;s right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by the coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This was carried over to this year last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow it to be rejected.
In contrast to the loud debate about the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored but most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with individual chapters and items of the budget, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggles between the government and the opposition.
It is more appreciated in the press that way, which is why it receives much more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the social democratic governments of the past struggled with three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the mandatory, so-called the high rate of the law on client spending, which includes not only pensions but also social benefits, which was approved last year by the quiet &quot;coalition&quot; of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limitation is the deficits of public financing, i.e. the budget deficits of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
Time bombs are the budget deficits of cities and districts.
In order to get money for other investments in addition to money from taxes, levies and bank loans, many mayors often issued bonds that left their town halls disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been paid off by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which were obtained from the state through privatizations.
Currently, they no longer have such resources.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase, which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly bragging about.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the country was driven more and more into debt.
With one or two exceptions, the other countries, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed their economy much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a huge shame of the previous governments.
We belong to the countries least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
For this reason, there is no need, for example, for huge social programs, which unfortunately have swelled to a gigantic size in recent years, completely unnecessarily.
Although it was possible to eliminate some of the pointless populist spending approved before the elections this year, even if there is no extension of the retirement limit and no pension reform in the near future, any politics in this country will effectively end, and no matter who governs, this is just bureaucracy. will be
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that most of the taxed money from governing politicians usually becomes mechanical distributors of pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year&#39;s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenses by client expenses.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not squandered everything they could in the last decade.
If we don&#39;t want the governing politicians to become mere officials, we must be patient and wish calm for the preparation of further reform laws to this not very strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can can be obtained from taxes and duties.
Only these allow the gradual achievement of a balanced budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In this way, more than a hundred billion dollars enter the financial markets through the stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, the bank raises the interest rate for which they are ready to lend money.
For example, the US Fed releases forty billion dollars to the stock market and makes another twenty-four billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11th attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
&quot;This move should solve the economy&#39;s biggest problems, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks can lend,&quot; Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to clients.
&quot;Coordinated action by central banks in the United States reduced the probability of a recession from 65 percent to about fifty percent,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks, primarily in the United States, have already lost sixty billion dollars due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect further billions in losses.
&quot;Central banks can really fear what may come next if they decide to take such a course,&quot; said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems like the situation is really bad,&quot; he added.
Central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also make loans more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce demand and push the US economy into recession with possible consequences for economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided this way after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank offer rate, which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain also lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
&quot;This will have a similar effect to further rate cuts,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the action of the central banks contributes to averting the crisis, as it does not solve the basic problem, the collapse of the American real estate market.
Klaus: The incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate changes threaten developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN&#39;s international conference on climate change held in Bali.
His book Blue, not the Green Planet, presented in Vienna, made it clear that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mix of representatives of governments and civil society organizations, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
&quot;There is absolutely no structure to the debate there, it&#39;s just throwing around words that are substitutes for solving the current problems,&quot; Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president emphasized that his topic is very important to him, which is why he is so committed to it.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book is also published in a German translation, since, as he said, &quot;I often only come across caricatures of my opinion&quot;.
So now those interested can read his undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Because he is able to monitor and evaluate professional theses, he is experienced in statistics as an academic and is also an economist.
At the end of the book, he stated as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, that is, its changes are normal, and that not all scientists have the same opinion regarding the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious, so they do not pose a danger, and the efforts to influence climate development they are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that &quot;he is not against reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits&quot;.
Klaus already spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people could not exchange their driving licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver&#39;s license in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for a replacement, so that the offices can issue the new driver&#39;s license in time for the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will start driving without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the driver&#39;s license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
As the districts report a sharp drop in interest in license exchanges, offices in the capital have been inundated with applications for license exchanges, which have seen an increase in interest this week.
The mayor&#39;s office receives around 2,000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet replaced their driver&#39;s license.
It takes twenty days to issue a new driver&#39;s license.
However, the new driver&#39;s license can also be applied for with a shortened deadline of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver must pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who cannot complete the mandatory license exchange by the end of the year, and who start the journey with an invalid license, will face penalties starting in January.
The criminal must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can settle the violation by agreement.
In the event of an administrative violation, the penalty is 2,500 kroner.
Based on previous information received from the town hall, even those who do not travel anywhere can be fined.
You can reportedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the offices to be lenient and impose fines of no more than a thousand crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, fines of tens of thousands are not a threat to anyone.
According to him, the driver&#39;s license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not an ID card that should be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their driver&#39;s license.
It is enough to take it away or send it by registered post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, the driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, motorists must gradually replace the other types of driver&#39;s license as well.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 can exchange them for another three years.
The validity of the driving licenses issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the punishment of Berdycchel&#39;s cooperating investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, suspected of colluding with David Berdych&#39;s crime syndicate, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court in Prague decided on this with final effect, reducing the sentences of one of them by one year and the other by two years.
Investigators from the Organized Crime Unit in Prague were originally threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today&#39;s decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be requested at the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first instance verdict.
In other proceedings, he was sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
You can&#39;t get more.
In January, the County Court primarily found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, of which the Supreme Court heard 16 appeals today.
The majority of the defendants rejected the accusations from the beginning of the investigation, saying that it was a matter of speculation.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, after the agreement with Berdych, members of the police, among other things, provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered individual robberies and helped the gang avoid prosecution.
The gang therefore gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment refers to the gang&#39;s crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are primarily robberies, the victims of which often suffer serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of a public official and unauthorized possession of weapons.
Because the police found illegally held pistols, steel-core bullets, laser sights or submachine guns during house searches.
According to the indictment, the gang looted tens of millions of crowns with the robberies.
The gang of almost twenty members was already legally recognized as guilty of Berdych&#39;s other robberies and many others by the courts in this proceeding.
Other members of Berdych&#39;s entourage testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Putá and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Bill for child exchange: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, is demanding 12 million kroner pain fees plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč for the children who were traded at the maternity hospital.
Three million each for mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, fundamentally disagrees with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We reject such a demand, as it is too much,&quot; Dostál said after today&#39;s hearing.
&quot;In order to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We determine whether it has usable value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that it will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone,&quot; emphasized Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted one million crowns for every month that they were not raising their own biological daughter.
Veleba was provided with an expert evaluation, which was prepared by the Motol University Hospital in Prague, as the basis for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the children&#39;s parents suffered mental damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
Men tolerated the stressful situation better, even if they were criticized for not preventing the exchange of newborns.
Veleba summed up the content worse than women cope with the actuality of the trauma they experienced and what is happening right now.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the maternity hospital in Třebíč on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina district head Miloš Vystrčil gave the families 100,000 kroner to compensate for their expenses incurred due to the error of the hospital in třebíčské, which is managed by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory damage insurance as required by law.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases, they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts have been calculated based on tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner.
Polivka lost his Valašsko kingdom
Polívka Bolek lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the name King of Wallachia, the project was developed by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor, with many years of work.
Polivka did not participate in the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case will probably not end and the client will appeal.
&quot;The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team preying on Bolek Polívka&#39;s popularity,&quot; Polívka&#39;s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, when everyone hears the words Wallachia kingdom, the actor-comedian comes to mind.
Harabiš also shares this opinion.
&quot;Almost ten years of work are behind us.
Finding the money and coming up with deals,&quot; he said.
According to him, the reason for the dispute is money.
&quot;Years later, they realized that the project was successful and that they could gain something from it.
They want to make a living from our work,&quot; he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, Polivka first used the name &quot;King of Wallachia&quot; in his television program.
In 1993, he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was unrelated to the goal of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valach passports.
The original student prank turned into a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš later founded the society of the Kingdom of Valašsko.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to put her name and signature on the passports, and even offered their owners discounts when visiting her farm and theater performances.
Who takes the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš only used the idea itself, which Polivka made public in the manèzes, for the benefit of his business.
&quot;The popularity of Boleslav Polivka must have helped the Wallachian Kingdom project,&quot; said the judge.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who worked intensively on it.
The cooperation of the now feuding parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have accumulated between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the acquittal of &quot;the eternally elected King Boleslav I&quot;.
The leading role in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother on Harabiš&#39;s initiative.
In 2002, he filed a lawsuit against Polívka Harabiš and his colleagues, which was rejected by the court today.
The fight planned by Harabiš for the throne and half of the princess could shed light on the debate.
There should be a new king from this fight.
He did not want to reveal the details and the date yet.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to rush anything.
This should be something like a royal procession in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polivka can also apply,&quot; added Harabiš.
Peugeot test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
To be honest, I&#39;ve never liked the Peugeot 206.
The ride characteristics are nothing special, the shifting quality, the driving and the production can often be described as below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, which is already on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called the SW goes one step further, so for me there&#39;s nothing left but to think more.
When I tested the Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the back seat, for example.
This time, the complaining is over, as the body of the station wagon means that even the two-meter-tall giants do not suffer in this regard.
Swiftly in the world
I quickly get through the interior so I don&#39;t repeat myself many times.
It&#39;s a relatively well-done design, where my only complaint is the poor console.
I would appreciate a little more designer invention here, if the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the days when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
Lateral control has also been significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, the increase in the dimensions of the body can also be felt here.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned little space for the head disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage space.
I have to rate this as very accessible (also thanks to the folding rear window) and spacious.
The blanks are equipped with support rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
They are not in the way, they can be pulled apart and they can also hold heavier objects.
But let&#39;s stay with the volume for a bit.
Based on the tables, this is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - in contrast to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the product of the new generation from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot lags far behind the noticeably large 52 liters.
This value is almost critical for vacations abroad or when inserting a stroller.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the almost completely straight floor after folding down the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6-liter, 88 kW, four-cylinder spark-ignition engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is how the 1600 driving the Cslád hatchback should look.
Quiet, low consumption and mainly pulls.
If we compare it to its Škoda counterpart, which often looks like a rag has been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
The price is good
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a foreign four-cylinder engine goes for Kč 329,900.
The car starts at 410,990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the tested one throws the equipment by another 80,000 Kč.
But we also had head airbags, automatic climate control, automatic windshield wipers, rear electric remote control...
In other words, the car costs Kč 531,900 with a trailer.
That&#39;s a lot, but add up the Fabia&#39;s extra equipment and you get a very similar result.
So there is nothing left but to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
There are more and more Eastern European children in British schools, which causes local concerns about the further development of local school affairs.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have escalated into violence.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated by a case in North Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Quarrels and teasing between students characterize the parents&#39; relationships as well.
The situation got so bad that the police in Chatham detained a Slovakian woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted him with racist insults.
The police also had to act after the attack of two twelve-year-old girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
&quot;When we were on our way home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he pelted us with apples and pears and then exposed his naked rear,&quot; the mother of the Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the disputes over Eastern European immigrants as a fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above indicate that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, 70,000 Slovaks looking for work are registered.
Around 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you make the right choice.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or heady cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
However, you can find much more on one island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and transshipment point for treasure that the Spanish looted in the Americas and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20s.
It was built by Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (primarily alcohol) was welcomed in Cuba, and drugs, gambling, and prostitution were supported.
Among his guests were, for example
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings were built in Havana, and cars that became cult symbols of the 1950s drove on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American show business stars and politicians.
And today?
You can put your signature on the wall of Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they will mix you a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still drive in Havana today, as the once-exported zhigulis and fiats have long since rotted in this salty and humid air.
Although mainly the oldest part of Havana has been significantly destroyed, there are still as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are.
Other places are getting nicer too, like Trinidad.
Considering that tourism provides the much-needed money, its development was given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so you can see working machines, whose contemporaries can only be seen elsewhere in museums.
Where should we go?
The most famous places are not avoided by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So it is not necessary to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that there is a museum on the aforementioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss visiting this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from limestone.
Limestone formations, limestone cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has accumulated in their hollows, thanks to which even the weathered cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form when you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman&#39;s Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy took shape in the beauty and monumentality of the not very big city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the Escambray plain and the sea, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped him remain an outsider.
Nothing was built there, so it was not demolished, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth visiting the interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Valley of the Sugar Mills.
And in the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark, where the music only quietens down in the morning.
Baracoa
The small town in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful town.
This opinion is probably influenced by the road itself.
Both roads leading from Guantanamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains, they lead through nature that is hardly affected by human activity.
Due to its untouched nature, the eastern peninsula of Cuba has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
The best chocolate is made here, there is a Columbus cross in the church (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, you can see some table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Caridad del Cobra, the patron saint of Cuba, Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of former slaves, and a lot of it. can be written.
That is, as they rightly say, it is better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans claim
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment also affect the course of the US mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline specific plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also consulting on further plans and coordination of the allies.
While US Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for more activity for NATO troops this week, Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid as a priority.
&quot;Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the population to initiate the further development of the economy and security themselves,&quot; British Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to data from the US government, the activity of the Afghan insurgents is the strongest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they requested additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
&quot;We need to think seriously about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them,&quot; says Gates.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar spirit today.
&quot;I am not happy with what is happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment that we would need, and that is not enough,&quot; De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have been discussions among the participating countries about whether all allies are giving their maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
&quot;The Germans are present in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they have been deployed in areas where the violence is the least and the combat requirements are not as high for them as they are for us in the south and east of the country,&quot; Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
&quot;Afghan sun thieves exposed: Germans play while our boys fight,&quot; wrote the Sun in an article accompanied by a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a rugby match played by a British team in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The national debt will reach one billion in 2009
Each Czech gets 84,000 kroner in public debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, by the beginning of December, the ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The public debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, this increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its public debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 crowns in debt.
Last year, the state was in debt by more than 11 billion crowns.
&quot;At the moment, it seems that thanks to next year&#39;s lower deficit, we will only be able to cross the one billion kroner mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and one trillion crowns,&quot; Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, the analyst of Next Finance, sees this in a similar way: &quot;During 2009, we can cross the one trillion mark.
Exactly when depends on the as yet unknown next budget.
If it were proven that the situation would change in the field of politics, politicians would be ready to save more, this could be postponed until 2010.
But I don&#39;t assume this change,&quot; he mentioned.
Growing debts
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The public debt is financed with treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state&#39;s internal indebtedness has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state&#39;s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called salable public debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
&quot;The debt between the whole year increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is really quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated in the case of loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
The bad thing is that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand, this shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here,&quot; Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, by the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily made up of the deficit of the state budget, which this year will probably reach 76 billion kroner instead of the assumed 91.3 billion kroner.
Furthermore, it is about the planned maximum resources of the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a reserve of ten billion kroner for the payment of pensions, the financing of state bonds of 43 billion kroner and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion kroner from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear before a Khartoum court today over the name given to a teddy bear
A Khartoum court sentenced the British teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and deportation from the country on Thursday evening for violating Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad. However, the Islamic religion forbids any depiction of its prophet.
Such an act is punishable by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her own apartment on Sunday. He was charged with violating Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after the students&#39; parents complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education several times.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class&#39;s teddy bear.
&quot;The children suggested a total of eight names: Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed were among them,&quot; says the school&#39;s director, Robert Boulos.
In the end, 20 out of 23 children chose the first name Mohamed by voting.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with a photo of the teddy bear and the inscription &quot;My name is Mohamed&quot;.
The teddy bear itself was not labeled with this name. Rather, the problem lies in the fact that any depiction of the Prophet is considered an affront to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons&#39; Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school, said he knew her well and that the teacher would never have done anything to offend any religious beliefs. According to him, it is only an &quot;innocent mistake&quot;: &quot;I only regret that the children voted on the name&quot;.
Many of the teacher&#39;s students agree with this opinion. According to them, the teacher &quot;treats the children very well&quot; and &quot;never talks about religion in class&quot;.
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Great Britain and has 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the Prophet. (This name is often given to the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can a game, for example, have this name?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at Wednesday&#39;s final meeting in Vienna on the province&#39;s future status.
The end result: failure.
The sixth and final talks between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended without any convergence of positions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
&quot;It is unfortunate that the parties did not reach an agreement regarding the status,&quot; EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger stated at a press conference in Vienna.
US Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is &quot;at stake&quot; and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
&quot;There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but a very difficult period is coming,&quot; he added, emphasizing the &quot;existence of obvious tensions&quot;.
The broadcast ends on December 10
On Monday, the mediation troika, which includes the European Union, the United States of America and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bochan-Kharchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the troika with another mediation in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans see their mediating job as completed on December 10th.
The Russians, who have already thwarted the cause of Kosovo&#39;s independence in the Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after the deadline.
&quot;Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, in addition to a compromise,&quot; declared Bochan-Kharchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo was under the control of the UN for 8 years, the Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina has stated that it is ready to unilaterally declare its independence if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
&quot;Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement,&quot; announced the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where the &quot;last chance negotiations&quot; had been going on since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
However, he added that his idea of autonomy for Belgrade &quot;would be a continuation of the past that ended in murders and deportations.&quot;
&quot;Domino effect&quot;
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the majority of Kosovo Albanians about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a &quot;domino effect&quot; in a region still unstable due to the independence wars of the nineties.
&quot;For Serbia, this does not rule out the possibility of a compromise,&quot; Tadic declared.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again insisted that the decision should be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
&quot;The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word&quot;
&quot;For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,&quot; declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
&quot;The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council&quot;.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that &quot;the Kosovo parliament will have the last word.&quot; He added that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians is based on &quot;conciliation&quot; with the Western powers.
Bush urges agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference he organized in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint statement.
According to Bush&#39;s statement, the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, have agreed to immediately start negotiations for a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every possible way so that they could sign the &quot;peace treaty&quot; in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate &quot;terrorist networks&quot; and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush declared, and reminded the two parties of their obligations regarding the &quot;peace agenda&quot; adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the purpose of the negotiations between the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority and Israel is &quot;to sign a peace agreement that will settle all outstanding issues, including the central issues.&quot;
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were driven from their homes during the 1948 conflict and lived in the territory of today&#39;s Israeli state.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations should be &quot;global and in-depth&quot; and touch on all areas of regulation, such as &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security&quot;.
After that, Olmert, who took the podium, promised that the future negotiations will be &quot;direct and continuous&quot;, and he will strive to &quot;finish them in 2008&quot;.
Bush set for the end of 2008 the realization of the Palestinian and Israeli &quot;vision of two states&quot; existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise to do so from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was hailed as a success by Washington), with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan that would guarantee Israel peace in exchange for the withdrawal of all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis &quot;represents an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it grasps the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues,&quot; the Saudi prince believes in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this kind of news, the official position and the rumors contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the General Inspection Body of the National Police (IGPN), on Sunday, a few minutes after 5:00 p.m., a police car was driving on rue Louise-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel.
&quot;The car was on patrol, so it was not participating in an action. It was traveling at a speed of 40-50 km/h, without sounding the siren,&quot; we learned from a police source.
The two youths without helmets were driving at &quot;high speed&quot; with a green Kawasaki motorcycle, &quot;which is not included in the official register and therefore cannot be used in road traffic&quot; (see below).
&quot;Because they didn&#39;t follow the right-hand rule, the motorbike hit the left side of the police car,&quot; says a policeman.
The results of the alcohol test on the vehicle&#39;s passengers were negative.
The fact that the front of the car is dented, the windshield is cracked in the shape of a star, and the bumper is torn off clearly shows the force of the collision.
Pontoise&#39;s public prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said in an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning that she had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D&#39;Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation, which was opened &quot;for manslaughter by negligence and failure to render assistance&quot;.
In the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN&#39;s investigation, the responsibility of the police can be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, the three witnesses of the accident, interviewed on Sunday evening, confirmed &quot;the report of the police, according to which the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car&quot;.
Yesterday, a strip, no doubt drawn by the footrests on the road, showed that the two vehicles got stuck and drove together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were impounded for technical inspection.
The medical examination of the bodies of the two victims was carried out yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Rumors spread like wildfire in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that the police quickly left the scene without offering help to the two youths.
In this regard, the IGPN expresses caution, but rules out that the police made &quot;any serious mistakes&quot;.
&quot;This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation and increased caution during this,&quot; we learned from a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness who described the minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks right at the site.
&quot;My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, and I immediately went downstairs to try to revive them,&quot; the witness said.
&quot;There was nothing more we could do.&quot;
He then noticed &quot;a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to revive one of the young people, and the fourth made a phone call.
The tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving police officers took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness&#39; statement that the ambulance arrived &quot;about 20 minutes after the police left.&quot;
Heart massage was also used, but to no avail.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that the police didn&#39;t try to help the young people.
The young people did get help.
Firefighters arrived on the scene immediately.
They did everything to save them,&quot; the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations since the state of emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, around 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures introduced during the state of emergency were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
They responded by throwing stones at the police, several of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar incidents took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several persons were produced.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court registered lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations over the weekend arrest of around 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were also several demonstrations in Multan in the central part of the country and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers&#39; movement has been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which brings together religious parties. Its leader &quot;urged the people to send flowers to those judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf.&quot;
&quot;Musharraf&#39;s promise is no longer valid&quot;
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, the Court must pronounce on the legality of President Musharraf&#39;s October 6 re-election by indirect voting.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his post and replaced.
&quot;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,&quot; the president told The News newspaper.
The promise of President Pervez Musharraf, according to which he would step down from the head of the army in order to assume the role of civilian president, &quot;lost its validity&quot; after the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Musharraf had until November 15, i.e. the end of his first presidential term, to get rid of his military uniform.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news about the postponement of the January elections.
By the way, the Pakistani government denied the rumor spreading throughout the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a forced residence by his deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) and poorly or not planned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancies (36%) are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Demographic Institute (Ined), forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) and poorly or not planned pregnancies.
According to Ined&#39;s estimate, different contraceptive methods, such as the pill or the IUD, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalization of contraception has made &quot;birth control&quot; more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took birth control pills, but today that percentage has risen to 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies can be said to be planned.
Every fifth person plans with a couple of months of precision, and if possible, for spring, since this is the most favorable time of year for welcoming a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of a torn solar panel essential to the station&#39;s scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk turned out to be a record in several ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to plan it, and it had to be done far from the living modules, with tools &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; by the astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when astronauts detached the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical feature that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to the laboratory modules.
However, you have to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, generating electricity with the help of 17.5-ton solar panels to its final location.
The crew then began opening the module&#39;s 76-meter-wide solar panels.
At that time, one of the boards that could be folded like an accordion was damaged by a stuck cable about 1 meter long.
In order to avoid further damage, the opening of the board was not continued.
The astronauts were originally tasked with doing a walk-through of the space shuttle Discovery and then repairing another solar array with a failed rotation system. Instead, they had to devote all their time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt while hanging from the space shuttle&#39;s 30-meter robotic arm attached to the station&#39;s crane.
He is one of NASA&#39;s best &quot;spacewalkers&quot;.
He is tall, strong, extremely skilled, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old man with a doctor&#39;s degree had to &quot;operate&quot; on the &quot;damaged&quot; solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and secured the damaged area with some &quot;rails&quot;.
He was assisted in his work by another &quot;spacewalker&quot; who remained near the safe passage, as well as the other astronauts from inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick insulated against the hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and &quot;homemade&quot; by the station&#39;s astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions fully opened the board before packing up his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, and today seven returned to the space shuttle Discovery to begin the return home scheduled for Wednesday.
The price of EADS shares is falling
EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris stock market after the aircraft and defense equipment maker announced that delays in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in additional costs of 1.2-1.4 billion euros.
EADS shares are currently trading at €21.96 after a 4% drop.
The company was forced to revise its 2007 operating profit forecasts as the development of the A400M&#39;s engine is delayed, which will obviously delay the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the combat transport aircraft, which was announced in October, &quot;will cost between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus,&quot; announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to the occurrence of these expenses, EADS will have to announce new plan figures for its 2007 operating profit next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not announce any further figures.
The company group also indicated that it took the six-month delay into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS&#39;s operating profit decreased by 86%: this was largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the giant A380, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to deliver the A400M aircraft to the French military in October 2009.
The status quo remains
Sunday&#39;s elections do not promise any big surprises: the vast majority of Russians will vote for President Putin&#39;s party, United Russia.
This shows the Russians&#39; need for stability, one might say arbitrary governance, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, i.e. three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the voters in a televised message via public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin leads the list of candidates for the pro-Kremlin party United Russia, which is expected to win a landslide victory in the election.
At the reception of the foreign ambassadors yesterday, the behavior of the head of state did not reveal anything: he only made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a favorite topic during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of real democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violation of the law,&quot; he added.
However, according to the opposition, this is by no means the case.
The opposition has condemned the campaign, which they say pressured voters.
The head of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, claims that &quot;there was no such dirty election in Russia even during Yeltsin&#39;s time&quot;.
After last weekend&#39;s protests were crushed, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in jail for an unauthorized demonstration and is still barred from visiting, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Russians still think like &#39;homo sovieticus&#39;&quot;
Predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election was published in the official newspaper yesterday, which will be March 2, 2008, and the candidates can indicate their intention to run until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any further.
However, there is no other successor on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Will he be prime minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party and the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing government wins both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has become a tradition.
&quot;Russians still think like &#39;homo sovieticus&#39;: they don&#39;t feel like they can control their destiny,&quot; says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolaj Koposzov, a historian at the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further than this: according to his theory, the country became Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed. And the traditional community spirit hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, &quot;Putin reverted to the paternalistic model, which suited the people perfectly. All the more so, since this new kind of paternalism was not associated with intimidation, but with a certain economic prosperity,&quot; Maria Lipman, a staff member of the Carnegie Foundation, believes. .
Today, Russians &quot;voluntarily reject personal responsibility&quot;, which quickly became apparent after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
&quot;Why should we think?&quot;
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of United Russia are headed by 65 governors who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 90s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, Russians do not vote for extreme parties either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: &quot;Why should we think?
The people in power aren&#39;t that bad, so why should we replace them?&quot;
Sad memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documents the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime, has become public.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen in the province of Hesse, have so far only been researchable for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes, i.e., they have only provided a unique and named opportunity to view former victims or their descendants.
The eleven states managing the archive - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archive in Bad Arolsen will allow historians to conduct research &quot;on the transfer of prisoners, the inhabitants of the camps and the health of forced laborers,&quot; explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed making the documents public because they contain names and therefore confidential information.
This could be, for example, the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
Lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons. The goal was to search for civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labor on the basis of these, and possibly provide evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, a part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the archive in Bad Arolsen to be of outstanding importance.
&quot;These documents basically contain nothing new,&quot; declared Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Berlin Technical University&#39;s anti-Semitism research center, in 2006.
The EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to 60 billion euros.
The EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, announced European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers already approved last April for the European Commission to initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to 60 billion euros.
The EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India&#39;s biggest foreign investor, but India is only the EU&#39;s 9th most important trading partner according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that &quot;a free trade agreement could be an economic stimulus for both parties&quot; and that &quot;India could increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people&quot;.
The European Commissioner added that Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India. The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange &quot;products worth 47 billion euros&quot; and &quot;services worth 10 billion euros&quot; each year, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week. However, he regretted that bilateral trade &quot;has not yet reached its full potential&quot;. The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday in the framework of the eighth diplomatic summit, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Answer to concerns: the Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the money market for a period of five weeks
The Bank of England wants to ease the anxiety about credit conditions, so it announced on Thursday that it will pump 10 billion British pounds into the money market, which it will make available at a base rate of 5.75% and, unlike usual, this time with a maturity of five weeks.
&quot;We want to alleviate concerns that money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more securely for this period. Therefore, the Bank is offering a significant part of its reserves as part of a five-week open market operation from December 6 up on the international money market,&quot; the bank&#39;s press release states.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6, at 12:15 p.m. local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate, and the repayment deadline is January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it is &quot;ready to take further measures&quot; in order to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
And the three-month interest rate exceeded the level of September 18: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the financial market crisis in the summer, the Bank of England charged significant punitive interest on the amounts pumped into the money market, which discouraged banks from using them.
According to the rumor (which is only strengthened by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro), many people would have been more happy with the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have accessed with a more favorable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Center group refrained from discussing the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained around ten measures, which were adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday. These included, for example, a 50% increase in employment allowance, the return of variable fuel tax, the introduction of traveller&#39;s checks and a cap on rents.
As the UMP and the NC voted 180:115 against examining the articles, the discussion between the ruling party and the opposition, which sometimes turned into heated arguments, was finally interrupted. All this happened just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he will resubmit all of his group&#39;s proposals as part of the amendment to the corrective financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about a new Philadelphia music festival to be organized by C3 Presents. However, now the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with Melvin Benn&#39;s British producer&#39;s company, Festival Republic.
&quot;We&#39;re honored to be working with someone who started the American festival movement today,&quot; C3&#39;s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits music festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey is held in the summer, so there will also be a chance to pitch a tent.
The festival takes place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private property about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world&#39;s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he started organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palette by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been involved in the production, licensing and organization duties of the Glastonbury Festival as a co-owner. This festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3&#39;s Charlie Jones has described Glastonbury Festival as the &quot;most inspiring event&quot; he has ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn&#39;s company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
&quot;The Philadelphia site was selected early on and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to bring this festival to downtown Philadelphia,&quot; said Charlie Jones.
&quot;We have been negotiating with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization failed,&quot; continued Charlie Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, we were able to discuss this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to put on a huge festival in another unique location that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia.&quot;
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago&#39;s Grant Park in 2005, after already proving its exceptional talent as a festival organizer in 2002 with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The gross income of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars, respectively.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
&quot;Melvin Benn&#39;s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and thereby create both the European rural atmosphere and the feeling of urban life common in America.&quot;
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic supporters of the event,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he reveals that &quot;the conditions are favorable enough to allow an investment in such a large event in a location that will hopefully host the festival for a long time.&quot;
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be &quot;huge&quot; in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the 80,000 capacity of Tennessee&#39;s Bonnaroo music festival.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of press release.
&quot;Vineland will basically be a rock festival, but we&#39;re planning a diverse musical offering so that everyone can find something to their liking,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, make up the company C3, which was awarded &quot;Best Independent Event Organizer&quot; at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal confronts the Terminator
It&#39;s not easy luring Hollywood directors to Montreal when you have to deal with the Terminator himself...
&quot;Seduction&quot; is one of the tasks of the Montreal envoy.
The mission promises to be &quot;politically difficult&quot; as the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to take on the &quot;Terminator Governor&quot;?
&quot;We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which is the best location for it.
If he finds conditions favorable in Montreal, he will go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions, on the basis of which they decide on our side,&quot; says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
However, Denis Turcotte now focuses mostly on promoting Canadian films.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco film festivals. You should also try to get the directors to hold auditions.
L&#39;Âge des ténèbres was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will also be shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec was also represented at the American Film Institute Fest this month with four short films and four feature films.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? Experts are divided on the &quot;subprime&quot; crisis
With just five weeks to go before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their palms and looking forward to the usual year-end rush.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, &quot;from a statistical point of view, the stock market usually behaves positively in December.
But forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct, in fact, the market is characterized by uncertainty in the current situation, at least in the short term&quot;.
The experts are by no means in favor of the end-of-year stock market slump, although they state that &quot;the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity to invest, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, which is negatively affected by the flight to quality securities , both in the long and short term&quot;.
For this reason, according to them, the stock market will be characterized by a sideways movement that is also free of volatility, &quot;especially since the effect of the Fed interest rate cut is still unknown, the price of crude oil is high and there is also a threat of inflationary pressure&quot;.
Javier Barrio, BPI&#39;s head of sales in Spain, agrees with this, meaning that he also thinks it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, &quot;the situation is not rosy at all&quot;.
The loss of Ibex is almost 4 percent compared to the highest values registered on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts are so bleak.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 may end the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the portfolios and the usual payments to the pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be moved to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and &quot;because of this, we may experience a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news from the USA regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis&quot;.
The analyst is confident that these will be favorable.
Analysts agree on the securities aiming to reach the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Intermoney&#39;s Solana emphasizes that &quot;it&#39;s the turn of the big-caps this year.&quot;
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, &quot;because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive&quot;.
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course if it happens at all.
&quot;ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow along this path,&quot; says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main player for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also do well, although the representation in this area is not very high in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the exchange rate fell in December only twice.
The real year-end rally was seen in 2003, when the stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 corrected back 28.17 percent, they registered a jump of 6.68% in December.
So it remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (currently the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a 12-hour branch from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This affects a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
The said branches will run under the name Popular Max and will make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group whose branches are unusually open continuously until 8:30 p.m., and even on Saturdays from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also stated several times that it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is just now preparing to reach an agreement with the unions, according to which it would close 75% of its branches in exchange for opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The experiences of Banco Popular Español will be of decisive importance for the other institutions, as they will decide on the basis of this whether they will join the initiative supporting more favorable business opening hours.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target private individuals, small and medium-sized companies, sole proprietors and local shops shopping in the mentioned places.
The bank wants to operate its 200 branches across Spain with the already mentioned opening hours for 18 months, because it is not a matter of new opening hours, but of the transformation of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches located in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new way of thinking about the character of the branches, with a more modern and colorful design.
The head of commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that the reorganization does not require a large investment, but they will have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine workers per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which even include meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were positive.
The branches in Madrid&#39;s Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and according to Rivero, the decision turned out to be the right one.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialize in immigrants and also have very favorable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The mentioned units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to create competition for our customers,&quot; Rivero points out.
For the time being, they managed to reach an agreement with Telefónica and will use external staff to sell mobile phones.
For the first time, Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival, Antena 3
&quot;We did it&quot;.
Paolo Vasile, Telecinco&#39;s authorized advisor, expressed his satisfaction with this sentence at the close of the market yesterday, when it was revealed that the TV station he runs has doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
However, something overshadowed his joy: &quot;it only hurts that this is not because we climbed more, but because we fell less,&quot; he said.
Even so, he emphasized the fact that &quot;we fell less&quot; in the weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a gain of 2.54 percent.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
52 percent of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 percent to Vocento, so its stock market value, according to Bloomberg data, is 4,488.88 million euros.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and can record a 40.5 percent drop since January, so yesterday it was worth half as much, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies in the case of Sogecable is 3,571 million; 2,518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarities between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can achieve in the same market, at what cost, and how it all pays off in terms of viewership.
Telecinco announced last week that it wants to become the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting adviser to Telecinco and Publiespaña. The latter is the advertising subsidiary of the group.
If the announced fact is realized, compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 fiscal year, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in this fiscal year.
Antena 3&#39;s net turnover increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (thus reaching 734.4 million), while the net sales revenue of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors triggering Telecinco&#39;s stock market momentum is the high pay out that has been maintained until now: in 2006, the company led by president Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the company&#39;s income to its shareholders.
According to Vasile - although it would be too early to decide - this ratio may change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company, Mediaset.
&quot;We officially guarantee a minimum payout of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already benefited them with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol&quot;.
According to analysts, the market is currently characterized by a slight slowdown.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its earnings estimates for Telecinco to 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in sales revenue will decrease from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the forecasts of the same company, Antena 3&#39;s profit will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.

1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities, mainly due to their high dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (hold) due to its &quot;multiple appeal&quot; and business strength.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases due to &quot;similar risks&quot; (saturated market and less favorable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which entered into force on November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings - which ended today with the congressional vote approving the Senate&#39;s amendments - the government initiated a social dialogue on the regulations underlying the law, so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts invested by the representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements, which served to create the most favorable regulations protecting investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the companies&#39; activities, for the sake of efficient market operation.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, enables the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advisory services for specialized companies, but also for natural or legal persons, and creates a new form of financial service company (ESIS) alongside securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, namely the financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalization systems for the execution of orders, which compete with existing stock exchange players.
Furthermore, the Law obliges investment service providers to provide market information regarding the defining aspects of their business profile, their risk taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the control of the CNMV, they must keep a record of all performed operations.
The Economic Committee of the Congress introduced several amendments. The most important of these is that securitized debts are treated as &quot;complex&quot; financial instruments, precisely because of the high risk they represent for the investor. This was confirmed in connection with the American high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economics and business qualifications. All this 30 years after the royal decree defining the professional functions that can only be performed by economists came into force in 1977.
And the Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary&#39;s agent, who works for someone else&#39;s account, does not need a license from the CNMV, and can distribute products or acquire clients for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and thus reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which is taken into account by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its release is in line with Eurostat&#39;s and the European Central Bank&#39;s strategy to provide data that is comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of timing and nature.
The preliminary indicator uses the same calculation method as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modeling method is different to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office emphasized that the preliminary indicator is purely informative, and therefore may differ from the final data, which will be published on December 14.
&quot;The Consumer Price Index still shows a relatively high value.&quot;
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the government and Minister of Economy, stated that the rise of the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only &quot;temporary&quot;, but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to show a &quot;relatively high&quot; value in the coming months too.
In the corridors of the Parliament, Solbes confirmed that &quot;although the indicator is not really favorable&quot;, the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less at the same level in recent years within the monetary union.
He also added that the month of November &quot;brought fewer surprises&quot; than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
&quot;We expected a value of around 4%,&quot; the Minister of Economy admitted regarding the data made public today.
Through Northern Rock, Virgin wants to get 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock&#39;s deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently amount to only 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it fell into crisis in mid-September and had to take out an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had a record number of deposits exceeding 25 billion pounds, the number of which has gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the fact that the Government promised the bank a hundred percent guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial trading name, Virgin Money. Virgin needs to take in around a quarter of UK banks&#39; revenue over the next three years to raise the remaining £18bn to meet its £30bn target.
The group of highly respected businessman Richard Branson, who became known for his advertising campaigns that created a great sensation in England, intends to spend about 50 million pounds (ie 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing in order to reach the set goal.
Northern Rock this week singled out the offer from the Virgin consortium as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case
Early today, the police arrested the mayor (People&#39;s Party) of Totana, located in the province of Murcia, as they are suspected of being involved in the city&#39;s corruption scandal that broke out this week.
In addition to him, a secretary of the Town Hall and the police chief of the settlement were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, formerly a member of the city council, took the place of People&#39;s Party representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel, may have been the head of the corruption network.
Police are continuing to investigate at city offices as well as the City Development Board, and it is possible that more arrests are expected.
The lawyer of Juan Morales was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the information of the radio station SER, the lawyer of Juan Morales of the People&#39;s Party was arrested when he was leaving Morales with the documentation related to corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the PSOE nomination in Toledo and the position of President of the Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE&#39;s Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to hold the position of President of the Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE&#39;s Secretary of Organization, José Blanci, at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party&#39;s federal headquarters today at noon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that &quot;we have to reckon with the best&quot; in politics, and Bono is &quot;among the best&quot;.
In addition, he added that the politician from Mancha will &quot;probably&quot; be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the position of President of the Parliament, if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current president of the parliament, Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he does not intend to run in the next elections and will give up his political career to instead fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he abandoned active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the voters are aware of who will be the economic vice-president in the event of the victory of the socialists, the party also wanted to inform them about who will be the president of the Parliament &quot;in the name of transparency&quot;.
If Bono will indeed hold the post, he would like Parliament to be &quot;a scene of respect and not of insults or shouting&quot; and to be more similar to the citizens&#39; homes.
&quot;Unfortunately, sometimes it seems that the Parliament is the only place in Madrid where you can&#39;t have a calm conversation, it has happened that the Prime Minister&#39;s speech was interrupted 26 times in the Senate&quot;.
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his &quot;excellent work&quot;, but he did not want to present himself as president, lest his opponents consider him &quot;superior&quot;.
Campaign for the climate
As the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who favor political or social battles, it must be very strong.
What&#39;s more, he has to put a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero on his side, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that &quot;we have to make a new agreement with our Earth&quot;.
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of his government has contributed to Spain being at the forefront of the EU&#39;s non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the agreement, which sector is affected and why did the Government not try to avoid this?
He should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will the population have to change, what energy savings should we expect on an individual and social level, and what economic consequences will this have?
In other words, who has to make sacrifices and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not received and will not receive an explanation of these questions.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and money.
Climate change measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and involve expenses for both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE&#39;s petrol price hike would have been so unpopular ahead of the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
In other words, we have to save the Earth from nothing, with just propaganda texts, empty slogans devoid of actual consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the prime minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, he does not demand, does not attack, in fact he beautifies the election rallies and awakens tenderness in us.

The mayor and police chief of Totana were arrested in connection with a suspected corruption case
The police arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in the province of Murca, José Martínez Andre of the People&#39;s Party, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a restaurant entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources informed today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating with the Urban Development Council and the municipal body entrusted with the management of Industrial Estates and Apartments.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday last week in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land was reclassified as development land to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes after illegal commissions were paid to managers. during their previous mandate.
Two other people have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to Totana Court No. 1.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who is now an independent parliament member of the People&#39;s Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the current girlfriend of the previous mayor, who lives in the provincial capital of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel NA, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José MG. The latter company also belongs to the Nuaria Group and the bribes were carried out through it.
The investigation is carried out by the group tasked with crimes committed at the municipal level of the Operative Central Unit of the Police, whose members, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven house searches, primarily at companies connected to the arrested, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who may have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, for which 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, which deals in real estate brokerage, Conycase, which manages the parking lots in Coruna, Venezuela streets and Katolicus Ferdinánd tér in Vigo, Hogartel, which specializes in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which deals with the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If they agree, we&#39;ll put the Book of the Month aside for a bit and see if we can pick up some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I already equipped myself with one.
People, life is constant change.
Of course, everyone can come up with something themselves.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland&#39;s biggest daily newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world&#39;s literacy level), Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what was published on November 18 at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn&#39;s book.
&quot;The philosophical teachings came to the public after the Jokela high school tragedy.
The killer, a student about to graduate, quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the Education Councilor entrusted with the teaching of philosophy, demanded on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that teachers examine Plato&#39;s teachings with a critical eye, and then added that knowledge of Nietzsche is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy classes of secondary schools.

One of your colleagues informs us that the offense related to Internet downloads is included in the Penal Code:
A. Downloading a song is a misdemeanor and punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
However, if you steal a disc worth less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1,000 euros in a shop, the theft is already a misdemeanor, but the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty that can be imposed in the case of internet downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car, but return it after 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty imposed in the case of internet downloading (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass fight, you can be punished from three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), but for copying a CD, you can be punished from six months to two years
(Article 270 BTK).
E. According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors&#39; consent is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, things have gotten really out of hand.

I got an article from my family doctor about some strange research called &quot;Money causes brain activity, especially when other people have less of it&quot;.
In other words, the employees&#39; feelings on pay day depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&amp;Brain Institute in Germany: &quot;The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly, but his partner made a mistake&quot;.
The researchers found that when both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but when one of them received double the amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bit of a sour taste as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, namely General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list that the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach chose as the title of his documentary: Carla&#39;s List (2006, not yet shown in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss attorney general from Belgrade to New York, as she tries to put pressure on the governments involved to tighten the noose around the fleeing criminals, just like a true crime story.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which provides security for the car owner against various damage events, brings significant expenses and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driver&#39;s license, marital status, type of car to be insured and the nature of its use.
Buying a car is only the first step.
Moreover, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car we want.
First, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes to pay compensation in the event of a damage event in exchange for a fixed insurance premium.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driver&#39;s license, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and others.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium based on statistics, i.e. those with a higher accident risk pay a higher amount.
That&#39;s why people over 25 or women pay less, because according to statistics, they are less of a risk because they are more careful.
Similarly, based on the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than single people.
The frequency is decisive for the type of use of the car.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
Many factors are taken into account by insurance companies when determining the insurance premium.
Therefore, the owner must look carefully in order to choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors when choosing, so that the needs of the insured can be best adapted to and an acceptable price can be established.
When concluding an insurance contract, those under the age of 25 have to take into account a number of disadvantages, such as a lack of driving experience and a recent driver&#39;s license.
Although it is most ideal if we are insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out complete insurance with a deductible, thus they will be insured against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
&quot;The amount of the deductible that the insured has to pay depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the deductible,&quot; says Luis Noguera, Spain manager of Internet insurance broker First Europa.
Another option is extended liability insurance for third parties, where the customer insures himself against damage caused to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, because this affects the bonus and thus you can reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
Discounts compared to the basic tariff of the insurance company are called bonuses.
The penalty charged compared to the basic tariff is called malus.
&quot;The amount of bonus and penalty depends on the insurance company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus rate,&quot; explains Noguera.
Once the age limit of 25 has been crossed, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents decreases thanks to the experience gained over the years.
In that case, we advise you to take out comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
&quot;In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience during an accident, not even when driving,&quot; says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the drivers have already passed the on the fear of beginners.
If the insured is already married but does not yet have children, it is best to take out complete insurance, of course if your financial means allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so the premium to be paid is lower in their case.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with a deductible (this can reach 300 euros), or if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance to include damage caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
&quot;They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford a higher deductible,&quot; confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with a deductible (which is around 150 euros), or in the case of a higher bonus, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a big expense, so it is essential to choose the appropriate form of insurance.
Celtic will be looking to pick up a point in Milan to reach the last eight.
Milan and Celtic go head-to-head at the San Siro on Tuesday to get the missing point at the end of the Champions League. The Italians can be the first and the Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already secured their place in the fifth round with a draw with Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but would need one more to keep six-point Shakhtar, who will fight with four-point Benfica, ahead of them.
The two matches of Group AD will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan have to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they will try to fight for a place in the last 16 in the semi-finals on the 13th.
With this, Group D ends earlier than the others, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be a draw, the two teams strive for victory, as the Italians do not want to fall behind at home, and Celtic can be the first to start from a better position in the round of 16.
Even a defeat is enough for Gordon Strachan&#39;s team to qualify if Shakhtar don&#39;t win, but you can&#39;t be sure of that, since if there is a tie, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), will go through. , but they won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night of the Scots bitter, who want to reach the round of 16 of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they lost there last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time following a 0-0 draw (1-0).
Shakhtar would be most happy with the victory of the &quot;Rossonerik&quot;, because if they lose, Celtic will enter the round of 16 and remain in UEFA.
Because Benfica, even though they are currently in last place and have no chance of staying in the European Championship, they can still get the third place with a win that would allow them to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver (Canada), performing in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
&quot;Posh Spice&quot; (Victoria Beckham), &quot;Scary Spice&quot; (Melanie Brown), &quot;Baby Spice&quot; (Emma Bunton), &quot;Sporty Spice&quot; (Melanie Chisholm) and &quot;Ginger Spice&quot; (Geri Halliwell) at GM Place in Vancouver a few minutes before the organized concert, they announced that the band was &quot;in great shape&quot;.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, where a video film was also shown about the history of the group that achieved huge success in the 1990s.
At the same time as the band&#39;s reunion and the tour, EMI launched a new album in Spain, which includes the biggest hits and two new songs &quot;Headlines&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot;.
The five members of the Spice Girls took the stage wearing bracelets given to them by &quot;Posh Spice&#39;s&quot; husband, British soccer player David Beckham.
The athlete was also there in the packed auditorium at GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Announcing the show, Victoria Beckham said the British soccer star &quot;hasn&#39;t seen our performance outfit yet, so I&#39;m nervous about what she&#39;ll think of the show.&quot;
&#39;Sporty Spice&#39;, was the reason the band broke up two years after he left the band in 1998 &quot;because the members didn&#39;t understand each other&quot;. He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
&quot;I was scared.
I was nervous, but I could see that people&#39;s feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought why not? Now I&#39;m glad I made that decision,&quot; Chisholm said of the band that broke up because of him nine years earlier.
The singer also added that in the meantime &quot;things have settled down and we love each other very much&quot;.
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
A group of babysitters was waiting for them at the airport.
The five of them have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears regarding the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Krajina and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect the Russian fuel delivered to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is routed through Ukraine, and the disputes between the two nations always attract a lot of attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raises the gas price paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of an earlier dispute between the two countries that erupted last year, supplies arriving in EU countries have decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is related to the attempt of the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas industry monopoly, Gazprom, to reach an agreement on the level of gas prices to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it must implement a 50% price increase for gas extracted from neighboring Turkmenistan compared to the 2008 price agreement with Ukraine.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
&quot;It is important that during the negotiations we argue in accordance with one of the most important natural gas transit countries,&quot; Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told the Reuters news agency.
&quot;Changes related to gas prices should definitely be connected to our discussion about the cost of transits through Ukraine (and to Western Europe).&quot;
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom shut off the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which at the same time greatly pushed up prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union&#39;s gas supply.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS &#39;must check foreign workers&#39;
Scottish NHS boards must improve their criminal record checks on workers from outside Europe, a watchdog has said.
The proposal was made by Accountant General Robert Black after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate figures on its overseas workforce.
At the same time, in his report - through a sample of five health authorities - he also pointed out key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Accountant General checked the list of staff recruited from outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove into the building&#39;s main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were questioned by video link at the Old Bailey in October over attempted car bombings in the UK.
In the case of overseas staff, NHS boards must check that they have qualifications and work experience and that they have the necessary permits to work in the UK before they start employment.
Although Scottish health boards use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the agency is not authorized to obtain such information from outside the UK.
Among other things, the Auditor-General&#39;s report recommended that the commissions introduce a Criminal Records Office guide to facilitate the employer&#39;s verification processes with various overseas countries.
&quot;Although we found evidence of such checks in staff records, they are not routinely carried out,&quot; the report said.
Black says NHS Scotland performs its own pre-employment vetting process to a high standard, adding: &quot;Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure we have up-to-date information on the number of overseas NHS staff&quot;.
Dr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was &quot;extremely unrealistic&quot; that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS staff who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
&quot;According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,&quot; he added.
According to the Scottish Health Authority, their overseas workforce, mostly doctors and nurses, currently stands at 1,161.
However, the chief accountant drew attention to the fact that the numbers are probably higher, which can be partly explained by the fact that identifying employees on indefinite leave is a problem for the committees.
The investigation also revealed that there is a high degree of coordination between the control procedures in place across NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian.
These procedures included checking passports, work permits, and documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS staff from overseas.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;I was delighted to be able to carry out this task following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, working with health boards, will take the recommendations in the report into account and ensure that up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire workforce, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. The updated version is scheduled to be released next month.
Joy Division wins the film awards ceremony
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, swept five awards at the British Independent Film Awards - including best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before playing Curtis, also received an award, as well as director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won the best actress award for the thriller &quot;Details of a Scandal&quot;.
Daniel Craig, who plays Bond, won the Variety award for putting the British film in the international spotlight.
The awards were presented at a ceremony held at the Roundhouse in London.
The film &quot;Control&quot; shows Curtis&#39; rise within the ranks of Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black and white film, which also features &quot;The Killers&quot;, David Bowie and &quot;New Order on the soundtrack&quot;, cost just £3m to make.
The Dutch photographer, Corbijn - who previously became known for creating the album cover of U2&#39;s &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; - was enriched with two awards; with the award for best director and best debut director.
Another award winner at the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple&#39;s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of the mob boss in the London-set thriller &quot;Killing Promises&quot; directed by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone, famous for his tough-guy roles, received the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose name is associated with the films &quot;Scum&quot;, &quot;Hunger Knock&quot; and &quot;Sexi dög&quot;, is currently participating in the filming of the film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;.
Winstone is proud to accept the award, named after &quot;Camelot&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Harris, who died in 2002.
&quot;For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door,&quot; added Winstone.
&quot;I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris&#39;s style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time and I respect him very much.&quot;
The independent film awards, known as Bifa, are decided by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested in connection with a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in terrorist cells who were planning to carry out an upcoming attack on an oil facility and several strikes targeting clerics and security forces.
According to the state television of the world&#39;s largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a US ally since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to television coverage, an eight-member cell led by a resident of foreign nationality planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province.
After an attempted attack by al-Qaeda on the world&#39;s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid-reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the report quoting the words of the Minister of the Interior, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a &quot;person specializing in missile launches&quot; who crossed the country border illegally.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight shells into the kingdom&#39;s territory.
Of those detained, 22 planned to commit assassinations against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to stem the flow of Saudis to Iraq to join al-Qaeda fighters fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government. The latter are considered heretics by Saudi hardline Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant number of Saudi Arabian church leaders as those who have been recruited by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which controls the government.
The organization&#39;s fighters - spurred on by the Saudi-born leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, called to target the pro-Western Saudi government - aimed to attack settlements with foreign residents, government buildings and energy facilities.
&quot;The security forces have made a huge effort in the past...five months,&quot; an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person &quot;media cell&quot; was also caught in Medina, whose aim was to spread &quot;Takfiri thinking&quot;. Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which advocates violence against Muslims branded as disloyal and apostate.
Those arrested also included 32 persons accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse into the future of Earth
According to the findings of scientists yesterday, Venus could once have provided pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European-orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is much more like Earth&#39;s whimsical twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth&#39;s closest planetary neighbor.
The two planets are almost the same in size and have similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists&#39; knowledge today, living conditions very similar to those on Earth may have prevailed on Venus several billion years ago, and even habitable conditions may have existed.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the planet&#39;s lower rotation speed, Venus entered a completely different development path.
Today, the planet&#39;s water has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency&#39;s Venus Express probe - based on a one-year study of the planet - paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said the following: &quot;It is beginning to emerge why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar structured.
&quot;With the help of our new data, it became possible to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have habitable conditions similar to Earth.
&quot;Enriched uranium&quot; seized by the police
Slovak and Hungarian police seized a kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - yesterday.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman would not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said the material could have been sold for $1m (£480,000).
The gates are wide open
Mitt Romney says it&#39;s unbecoming of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Still, the Republican presidential candidates agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday night, Nov. 28, turned out to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming during the other party&#39;s YouTube debate.
However, the questions and answers on this occasion reflected well the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year&#39;s election.
It is not yet known on what basis the production managers of CNN, which co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube clips presented to the candidates.
The longest issue in the first half hour of the debate dealt with immigration.
This topic is a sticking point for Republicans.
CNN asked some undecided voters to dial a number if they heard something promising: the moderator saw overwhelming agreement when the candidates made tough statements about the border issue.
The liveliest and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, the national front-runner, and Romney, who was advancing in crucial primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that he handled the issue of illegal immigration too lightly during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The war of words between the two became particularly heated when interviewers asked about support for &quot;amnesty&quot; (which would grant illegal immigrants permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, managed to delve deeply into the issue.
And although none of them is considered a candidate for the nomination, their staying in the race can perhaps be explained by the fact that they started ringing the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad agreement between the candidates: the common goal is to strengthen the borders and take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with fears of China&#39;s toxic toys and other troubling factors from the outside world, helps to forget or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives within Republican ranks.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the discussion turned very unpleasant.
Giuliani faced questions about why he previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney got into a debate over whether simulated waterboarding should be considered torture.
Another interviewer wondered if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this issue, Giuliani stumbled and finally took the point of view that although he considers the Bible to be his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
To this, Mike Huckabee, who won first place in the just-concluded Iowa election - who owed his victory to his staunch Christian conservatism - reacted, contrary to expectations, by saying that the death penalty is painful, but it is necessary.
When asked whether Jesus would get enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than running in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Huckabee&#39;s surge in Iowa coincides with a fundraiser for libertarian Ron Paul and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at Wednesday&#39;s debate.
The sudden advance of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to field a joint candidate from among the aspirants representing more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who unified the party, who delivered a timely and convincing victory message of America&#39;s greatness, and who found common ground with both wings of the party.
However, the party is now divided, and the consequences of this are currently unforeseeable.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown faces yet another gap; the exit path is unchanged
Compared to British political scandals, the current one does not seem too spicy.
No one sold their honor, no politician had his Paris hotel bills discovered, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman secretly contributed more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) to Britain&#39;s ruling Labor Party over four years under the names of others, and that the party did not report it, is one of the things without which the besieged Gordon Brown would have been fine.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when he recklessly questioned the intellectual capacity of the British people with his statement that opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, people still hoped that Brown would ensure a strong and efficient government.
But instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly witty deputy leader of the Lib Dems, has noted, the once-feared Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The botched move to rescue Northern Rock, a struggling bank, exposed regulatory weaknesses and lapses in judgment.
Sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to unite against the government.
The loss of the personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed an unimaginably high degree of administrative clumsiness.
Three retired generals have sparked a riot in the House of Lords protesting cuts to the army budget, saying the position of defense secretary is a part-time job.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labor Party (previously chief administrative officer) has already resigned.
Those accidents don&#39;t mean Brown can&#39;t turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach a point beyond which control becomes impossible.
People don&#39;t like or trust politicians, but they usually suspend disbelief when a new group comes to power.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is most likely not fit to take things forward and may not even stay in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief ends: the civil service starts leaking, the cabinet ministers start briefings, the press looks for bad news; and the government will become defensive and unable to focus.
In a way, Brown is in a particularly difficult position because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered &quot;fresh blood&quot;.
As much as he wants to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and the IRS records, for example, are tied to decisions Brown made when he was finance minister.
And although he was not directly involved in Blair&#39;s missteps - such as the protracted investigation into the connection between the &quot;nobility for money&quot; case and political party funding - voters may rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown&#39;s situation is indeed unpleasant, it is not as embarrassing as it seems.
The blunders are not as scary as the Tories make them out to be.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly infected.
And the compensation - no matter how much pain it entails - can be the creation of the trends always promised by Stalin living in Brown: reliable, solid and somewhat heavy-handed governance.
A good example is the buzz around political donations.
The mysterious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his charity to the public.
Perhaps so, but it was not within his competence to make the decision.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the population has the right to know who is knocking on the door of the country&#39;s leaders.
Watt, who, by his own account, knew of Abrahams&#39; action but was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be made to sweat during interrogations; as did Jon Medleson, Labor&#39;s head of foundations, who became aware of the murky donations in October.
However, for now, there are no leads to Brown: there is no indication that he knew about these transactions, not even the fact that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
Although he immediately condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, his firmness was diluted by the fact that he resorted to a familiar tool; for the sake of safety, he commissioned a committee headed by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case.
The &quot;lesson to be learned&quot; in this story is not too complicated.
In case of violation of the law, the police is responsible.
In addition, Brown also has to put other things in order, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee that has been operating without a leader for six months, which discusses public administration rules, or the promotion of the effective reform of political party financing.
This would require the hard-hat Labor Party to cooperate with the Tories and break with the special financial ties associated with the associations - this would be a tough bite for the party-loyal Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to the polls, the conservatives are currently leading by a large margin; Brown has two years to win voters back behind him; the only way to achieve victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime crisis threatening America&#39;s credit card market?
If there is blood in the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is ailing, predators are focusing on the nation&#39;s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail loans, the loss of the credit card market could reach up to 99 billion dollars.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-off rate, indicating the proportion of uncollectible loans, and the default rate, indicating the proportion of overdue payments exceeding 30 days, increased.
HSBC last month reported a $1.4 billion loss in its U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to financial weakness among cardholders.
However, it is still too early to panic.
Write-offs and late payments remain low.
The 3.89% delinquent ratio calculated by Moody&#39;s for the third quarter is a full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The 2005 amendment to US personal insolvency rules resulted in a sudden drop in the number of people filing for insolvency, but at the same time caused a large-scale loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-off rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the overall conditions for borrowing deteriorate or not.
The payment ratio, which shows the ratio of consumers&#39; monthly loan repayments, is also firm in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on their credit cards to pay off their home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the flow of money and not the value of assets, so a fall in house prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even be beneficial for creditors.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage loan, consumers have less incentive to repay the loan; as a result, paying off credit card debt moves up the priority list.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden asset repricing.
&quot;It&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;re going to wake up one day and completely reevaluate credit,&quot; says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If falling housing prices and a slump in credit plunge America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
It&#39;s worth keeping an eye on those predatory fins.
British bankers pleaded guilty in the Enron case
The three British bankers who were put on trial for their role in the fraud involving former Enron CFO Andrew Faston pleaded guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, alleging they cooperated with Fastow in an undercover scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at their employer&#39;s expense.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they each pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition procedure.
The investigation of the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 in the United States is still pending.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron&#39;s bankruptcy.
Dubbed the &quot;NatWest Trio,&quot; the three brokers, according to the indictment against them, traveled to Houston in 2000 to set up the fraud with Fastow and Fastow&#39;s right-hand man at the time, Michael Kopper.
Fastow, responsible for masterminding the countless frauds that brought Enron into bankruptcy, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any stake in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest was quite large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank&#39;s $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would buy the $20 million subsidiary stake from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact the $20 million fell into the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The indictment alleges the bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of involvement in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and one month in a Texarkana prison.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States, where they are staying during the trial, in return for bail of $1 million each.
Enron, the seventh largest American company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide the millions it had accumulated as debt and the businesses that were declared profitable but were actually unprofitable.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, a drop in market value of more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds by more than $2 billion.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of complicity in the company&#39;s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Lay were dropped when he died last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, which can make the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles non-stop on one tank, starts at $54 million.
But this amount is just a pittance for some rich Russians.
&quot;It holds 18 passengers,&quot; Gulfstream spokesman Dan Firer said.
&quot;But no one orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or company managers.&quot;
Mr. Firer expected visitors at the four-day, exclusive Millionaires&#39; Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall in the vicinity of the capital.
Along with Gulfstream, more than 200 other purveyors of luxury goods rented booths at the show, hoping that Russia&#39;s nouveau riche would be interested in everything from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-encrusted 50-cent radiator grilles.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on display at the stand next to him.
&quot;It&#39;s a nice car, but it&#39;s no match for our products,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia has the largest market for private jets.&quot;
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did in its heyday during the oil boom.
&quot;We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were seen here as material.&quot; - said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard University&#39;s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi Arabian gamblers of the 1970s and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the world&#39;s most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands claim their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, at a conference organized by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes&#39; list of the richest people, there are 53 billionaires in Russia who have a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can claim a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study by economists of the Economic and Financial Research Center analyzing the development of personal well-being in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005, the number of people living below the subsistence minimum in Russia was 15.8 percent.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole participated in the fair for the first time with the brand&#39;s Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
&quot;All the women are impeccably groomed, and the men are a real treasure trove.&quot;
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, who wandered through the halls on Sunday evening in evening dresses, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
&quot;I was looking at the cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,&quot; said the young Yumatova, who was brazenly twirling in her custom-designed dress, as if she was already used to this commotion.
The fair was organized primarily for the nouveau riche, for those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing, after spending several hours in traffic, to walk around a drafty, digit-decorated location, where they can simultaneously find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, regular pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
For the average person, the entrance ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
&quot;Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best,&quot; said Mr. Gijrath, who sat with a patriotic look at the booth of Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated imitation of Rembrandt painted on blue tiles.
&quot;Russians are of course more interested in flashy things.&quot;
Indeed, the vendors here said that for a long time (by Russian standards, that&#39;s 10-15 years) rich Russians have already switched from flashy logos to low-key, limited-edition brands that wouldn&#39;t make it into a trade fair.
Still, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires&#39; agents and tourists, crowded the place every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil bed manufacturing company, said that on that day he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, each worth 70,000 dollars.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate at A1 Moto, which supplies high-end cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of LA Connection, a luxury car manufacturer providing solutions for individual needs, sold three radiator grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble linked chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel he made for a Russian casino owner, which he said he covered with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set: $22,000.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin or a picture of his wife&#39;s face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these items.&quot; said Karapetian.
&quot;Instead, he will keep them in his garage, which has 30-40 cars.&quot;
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says the term &quot;Russian millionaire&quot; isn&#39;t much of a privilege these days, given the skyrocketing property prices there.
&quot;Anyone who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;
Those who are not millionaires could at least give the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone booths stacked with millions of fake dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires&#39; Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many people took photos of themselves with their mobile phones as they rummaged through the piles of money or just pocketed a few million.
&quot;You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire,&quot; Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice is suspected behind a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out the plate glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and saw an ambulance pull up on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Not long after, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another.
&quot;Then I saw the doctor&#39;s car pull up,&quot; Mr Livingston, a supervisor working at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
&quot;That&#39;s when I knew someone was dead.&quot;
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo. She previously worked as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by police at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine what caused Arroya&#39;s death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has deeply affected the senior staff of the Newark police department.
Arroyo, whose voice was recognized by many in the department, had worked as an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
&quot;She was loyal, hardworking and reliable,&quot; McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
&quot;. He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector.&quot;
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who now works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and is survived by two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon.
&quot;The likelihood is there,&quot; Walsh said.
&quot;The investigation is still ongoing.&quot;
Reports from the authorities reveal that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. on November
21st and found Ms. Arroyo on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the police have so far revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh would not say whether Castro had been interviewed by investigators.
The participants in the investigation are investigating whether a part of the house functioned as a doctor&#39;s office.
No one answered the door Wednesday at Castro&#39;s home, where a wilted rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the basement, in the driveway, was a blue container labeled &quot;Ethyl Vanilin,&quot; a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung sideways from hooks.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the new city&#39;s unusual and unpolished political culture.
&quot;He always said: You&#39;d better watch out for this and that!&quot; he remembered.
&quot;He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left at night.
It was confusing.&quot;
Expectations of a Fed rate cut are sending world stock markets into a tailspin
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic rose yesterday after the reassuring statements of the vice president of the American Central Bank increased hopes that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe faltered after Donald Kohn, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke&#39;s right-hand man, said that leaders should respond &quot;flexibly and pragmatically&quot; to the ongoing unrest in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn&#39;s clear aim to calm markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crunch, he said the current unrest has &quot;reversed some of the market&#39;s progress in late September and October.&quot;
He said if the increased confusion persists, it could raise the possibility of further tightening of credit conditions for households and businesses.
The statements were interpreted by investors to mean that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even to further cut interest rates in order to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements also had a calming effect on Wall Street, which has recently been hit by several bad news concerning the American economy. Such was the case, for example, with the negative record of the number of US home sales.
The side effect of the financial unrest was also reinforced by the announcement of the Bear Stearns investment bank that it is laying off 650 workers, or 4 percent of its global workforce, as part of cost reductions in order to offset the losses achieved in the US secondary mortgage sector.
A total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters, which employs 1,500 workers, will be affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
London&#39;s FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The unrest in the credit market was renewed after the high-demand auction organized by the European Central Bank sold the three-month notes to European banks at a price of 4.7 percent, which had not been seen since April 2001.
After the English interbank rate, Libor, after a steady increase since November 12, reached the highest value seen since September, 6.59 percent, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB t, and release additional capital to the London money market.
In England, they demand the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Given two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should wear England&#39;s number six jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And indirectly related to the first Test against Sri Lanka is no less important, who makes the decision?
On the one hand, the latter question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors, who temporarily fulfills this certain task, will help the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. And on the other hand, because the desk drawer of the England executive director, Hugh Morris, is starting to fill up with requests to reach the national, or at least one-off, position of selector.
Of the two players, the one who doesn&#39;t get the sixth batting slot draws the shorter one, but as you know, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It&#39;s never easy to tell what makes someone reach the top of their profession, while others can&#39;t even get past a lower level. Many times it depends on luck rather than talent.
It is not only characteristic of cricket that selection is difficult - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move on?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example if, say, John Edwards and &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, two bright, well-educated, business-savvy young executives, were presented to the decision-makers, when only one of them there is room for him.
Who can tell what level a cricketer is for without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, the data greatly influences the decision, but the options are just as important.
In a team, a player has to catch the eye of the captain at the right moment in the cricket wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the selectors&#39; eye is much more complicated.
For example, several players played better than James Anderson last season, but he is considered a sure member of the team for the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison, according to his own words, is in good shape and his batting is very good.
Anderson fought his way into the tour with 32 first-class wickets and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both have had successful moments at the highest level and hope to continue in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well that will be decided by the opinions.
This decision can make or break someone&#39;s career, but it may not have much impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, although Gareth Batty played in every Test and performed well with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was the then-up-and-coming Paul Collingwood who stood out and became a dominant Test cricketer, who is perhaps still underrated even today despite the fact that in Australia , scored a double hundred against the Australians.
It is likely that in their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today&#39;s game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, listening to their conservative instincts, will vote for Shah&#39;s greater experience over Bopara&#39;s young vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
His bright and successful debut in the quarters of the 88 Bombay Test speaks for Shah. Against the six of 22-year-old Bopara, seven years younger than him, who also excels in twisting throws, he scored 32 first-class hundreds.
But the fact that Middlesex&#39;s Shah managed only ten runs in two quarters in the Test at Lord&#39;s at home in May against the West Indies, and the fact that Vaughan, who was fighting for his inclusion in the next game, met with immediate opposition from the selectors, seems it reduced the tenacity in him that was still clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex&#39;s all-round talent is a jovial and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to upset him on the cricket field, but his behavior off the field was well described when he overturned a four-wheeler belonging to the team&#39;s car sponsor, Volkswagen, at an exhibition.
He received minor injuries and was probably shocked. Still, the first thing he did afterwards was pick up his (sponsored) Vodafone phone and call his team-mate Alastair Cook, who was watching from a distance, to ask: &quot;Did you see that?&quot;
Bopara is a better sideline player with classics. His sliding mid-steps create an advantageous throwing angle for him, and his strikes are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I&#39;d give Bopara the chance now, which isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t think Shah wouldn&#39;t be outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he&#39;s the one playing at the weekend.
Refugees are being bussed home to work and fight Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses have been arriving in Baghdad from Syria with Iraqi refugees whose money has run out or their visas have expired, or those who hope that order has been restored in the city.
There are also those who returned to fight the soldiers who chased them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning home from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus, filling dozens of buses, arrived.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,&quot; said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
&quot;I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
&quot;They say the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people,&quot; he added, referring to the militia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now stopped his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni town of Amariyah, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up jobs.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarija called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-backed troops, Al-Qaeda had been ousted from their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, after he began urging his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
&quot;Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they have formed an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they need my support and my sons&#39; support.
That&#39;s why I came back today,&quot; said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many people talked about how the peace that had strengthened in the capital since the entry of American troops and the armed civilian forces cooperating with the Americans lured them home.
But even more people were forced to return home from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, echoed the widely held view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to reject the refugees&#39; visa applications in order to force them to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people escaped from the death squads operating in the country.
&quot;Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis in order for them to move home,&quot; the Sunni pensioner said.
&quot;I can&#39;t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I fled.&quot;
One of the reasons for the easing of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite areas, while Shiites have also left Sunni-populated areas. As a result, tension has decreased in many regions.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will stir up the mood again, which could even lead to more fighting.
Little Saarland - level training
The smallest federal state plays a leading role in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one area of training do Saarland residents struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
&quot;Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a person outside the Saar region that we are not French&quot; - this is the self-ironic slogan on the posters for the smallest federal state&#39;s 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which can boast fifth place based on surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighboring countries, if only because of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
However, the colleges and universities of the Saar region have an above-average attraction for those who want to study in the Saar region - many of them do not even have a high school diploma.
&quot;In the Saar region, they take advantage of the opportunities for vocational training,&quot; explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than a fifth of the young people acquire the right to continue their education at a vocational school, which means that the Saar region exceeds the federal average by more than seven percent.
The possibilities of combining professional and higher education are also well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies ranks second in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore obliged higher education institutions to carry out a marketing campaign with engineering as its focus.
&quot;We initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Pisa study,&quot; said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that has since been copied by other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will provide an answer as to whether the students&#39; performance improves permanently.
Based on the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of students affected by the risk shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland did not improve to the same extent as the other federal states.
Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of the people of the Saar region, knowledge of a foreign language is not taken into account during the Pisa assessment - otherwise, they would otherwise reap laurels in this area,
since the language of the neighboring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools - even if the people of the Saar region are not French.
Chávez resets the clocks
In the near future, the clocks in Venezuela will run differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the clocks back half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela&#39;s official newspaper, according to a new law, the clocks will be turned back four and a half hours to Greenwich Mean Time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by saying that time zones based on whole hours were imposed on the world by the United States.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
&quot;I cannot do this because of my own dignity,&quot; declared Chávez, who is advocating a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must form an opinion in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe&#39;s decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
With his decision, Uribe &quot;spat in the face&quot; of Venezuela, Chávez voiced his criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is also talking about Chávez.
A new mobile ringing tone has caused a stir in the country: &quot;Por qué no te callas&quot; (Why don&#39;t you shut up) - that&#39;s how the phrase sounds, which more than half a million people have already downloaded for themselves from the Internet.
The phrase comes from Károly János, King of Spain, who was so annoyed by the left-wing populist politician&#39;s constant shouting at the recent Latin American summit that he interrupted him like this.
In 2007, the Germans are threatened with a decrease in wages
According to a forecast, German workers are at risk of falling real wages this year, despite the strong economy.
Experts supported their pessimistic forecast with a bunch of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler-Foundation, in 2007 employees can actually count on a lower salary than the previous year.
&quot;The reason for this is the modest increase in wages, the increase in general sales tax, and the rapid rise in food and energy prices,&quot; Gustav Horn, a staff member of the Macroeconomics and Economic Research Institute, told the &quot;Bild&quot; daily.
New burdens may also fall on employees in connection with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stated in a statement to the daily newspaper &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; that in the current situation it is correct and reasonable to reduce the unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labor Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation that it has to apply to the federation for loans or support, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted as saying.
It became known on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In an annual comparison, prices rose by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth&#39;s evil twin
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: The European &quot;Venus Express&quot; spacecraft discovered lightning in its atmosphere and wind vortices similar to those that occur on Earth in winter in its polar circles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that lightning occurs on Venus.
The European &quot;Venus Express&quot; spacecraft provided evidence - it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning that occurs on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at an altitude of approximately 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel, a colleague from the University of California, Los Angeles, reports in the columns of the scientific magazine &quot;Nature&quot;.
According to the famous &quot;primordial soup theory&quot;, the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms started reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: &quot;If there ever was life there, it must have been very early,&quot; explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Currently, living organisms can hardly exist on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and the temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
&quot;Venus may be Earth&#39;s twin from hell, but it&#39;s still Earth&#39;s twin,&quot; Russel said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different development path.
The launch of the &quot;Venus Express&quot; in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the beginning of the nineties, no probe had been on its way specifically to search for this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results presented in several &quot;Nature&quot; articles prove more than just the uniqueness of Venus within the Solar System.
&quot;They also show that the neighboring planet&#39;s similarity to Earth is greater than we first assumed,&quot; Esa said.
In addition to the well-known North Pole vortex, the researchers also discovered an even faster-moving cloud vortex at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth&#39;s winter hemisphere, claims the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the Solar System has almost the same mass as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers it is almost the same size as the Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Evening Star, orbits the Sun in just 225 days,
however, it rotates much more slowly around its own sun: One Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus&#39; surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius combined with a pressure of 92 bar hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under completely similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel&#39;s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands an end to the dispute between the parties that erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the reception in September.
The President of the German Republic, Horst Köhler, is concerned about Germany&#39;s authority and has called on the grand coalition to end the controversy surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
&quot;On this issue, we should not present ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world,&quot; Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
&quot;For me, human rights are universally valid, even if I respect the differences between cultures,&quot; underlined Köhler.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the delicate balance in terms of foreign policy, emphasized the President of the Republic; however, he came to Merkel&#39;s defense against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
&quot;The Federal Chancellor did not break with the traditional &quot;one China&quot; policy.
China is also aware of this&quot;, asserted Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became a target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the EU&#39;s &quot;showcase policy&quot; in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, severe disturbances occurred in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only refused the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from SPIEGEL, froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that hosting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects if European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s actions and words have indicated that he is trying to break away from China the additional Tibetan territories that include Tibet and other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from turning into street violence, demands the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades were on fire, rioters shot shotguns at the police: After the serious riots by young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
&quot;We have to make sure that the social explosive material does not accumulate here and does not turn into violence.
We have to take it seriously,&quot; he told the Hanover-based &quot;Neue Presse&quot; newspaper.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Federations, states and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, Schäuble said.
All this does not only affect the integration of immigrants.
&quot;From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already showing.&quot;
However, it is still too early to lift the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble hinted that German suburbs do not have the same urban architecture and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have had serious street battles with the police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Taking all of this into account, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded a greater degree of activity from the federal government regarding integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the &quot;dangers of imitation&quot;.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
yet action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is &quot;higher than average&quot;.
Above all, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat emphasized: &quot;We need to provide a perspective for young people.&quot;
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that &quot;social supervision within the family&quot; is much more present in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns: &quot;Still, we have to be on the lookout.&quot;
For young people, &quot;the opportunity to have a job and receive an education must be ensured as quickly as possible&quot;.
Meanwhile, Villiers-le-Bel, a suburb of Paris, was completely quiet during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, a helicopter scanned the area with headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the report was made, a security unit of around 1,000 people has ensured peace.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Home Affairs Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel during the night of Tuesday.
The following night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The unrest broke out in connection with a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the initial findings of the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
Skywalker in Angela&#39;s realm
The chancellor&#39;s out-of-touch behavior is proof that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing can be expected from him.
Actually, in which country does the federal chancellor live?
After his bleak, content-indifferent and nonsensical performance at the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be stated: he does not live here - not in the country whose government it is his job to govern.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she would focus too much on foreign policy with a very superior sentence.
That is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed his unwillingness to understand what his critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how apt the reproaches were.
Meanwhile, neither concrete interest nor empathy was felt for the country&#39;s problems.
Instead, Angela Skywalker emerged: a politician who is alienated from reality and escapes to foreign policy, where only uncertainty is her own.
An example of climate protection: He praises himself uncontrollably for the Heiligendamm Resolutions, but is silent about how the country&#39;s climate goals should be achieved.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned - this level of immodesty would not have been allowed by the chairwoman of the CDU two years earlier.
Now he clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems instead of words.
However, in Skywalker Angela&#39;s realm, domestic political problems are only secondary matters.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
He praises this in just a few half-sentences.
From this point of view, it is telling how often he stumbles when it comes to the family allowance.
Merkel has to push herself three times to put together a half-sane sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he stumbles into foreign territory.
Seizure Department
During the debate of the Republican presidential candidates held on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, exchanged harsh blows - and now they have to fear an outside candidate as well.
The tension of the candidates already surfaced in connection with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York a &quot;sanctuary for illegal immigrants&quot;.
Giuliani counters with serious facts: &quot;I would say that his own house served as a haven for illegal immigrants&quot;, retorts Giuliani, and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants as a private individual.
The candidates go on a rampage: Since the Republican camp still does not have a single favorite, the eight presidential hopefuls are using the debate on CNN above all to undermine the credibility of their opponent.
Self-shot 30-second videos submitted by Internet users via YouTube are little more than short summaries.
&quot;We brought Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism&quot;, John McCain rubs under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one of the participants in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney&#39;s head is also thoroughly washed by the Vietnam veteran when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called &quot;waterboarding&quot;, an interrogation method in which waterboarding is simulated, as torture.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign, meanwhile, lie beyond Iraq and the debates about torture, is shown by the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Loud applause breaks out in the room as conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly apparent.
&quot;I was wrong at the time,&quot; says Romney repentantly and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for voting in favor of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, hesitates when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is ruling as a civilian for the first time
A day after his resignation as the head of the army, Musharraf, who exercises power in Pakistan, was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan&#39;s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to the constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, primarily from the United States.
The former general is governing for the first time as a civilian head of state, eight years after his bloodless rise to power in the form of a military coup.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled a basic demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the state of emergency soon after he is sworn in, fulfilling another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf appointed lawyers sympathetic to him after the declaration of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, last week rejected all kinds of protests regarding the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured as a result of an attack against a military convoy.
According to information provided by the army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road close to the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock are back
The German supergroup of the seventies is making music again: The three band members of Harmonia dusted off their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the reunion, a clip from their heyday, &quot;Live 1974&quot;, will be released.
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation takes shape in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each one has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, is enthroned in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
From the left, Michael Rother, considered young at 57 years old, provides accompaniment with a laptop and guitar.
From the audience&#39;s right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is hunched over and concentrating on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, sometimes also a rhythm.
And all of this sometimes comes together as traditional music almost by accident.
However, none of this seems to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the krautrock music trend that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What we can reveal here: As a result of proper research, we can establish that the name slipped through the collective pop memory, but in no case did it leave such lasting traces that we miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why shouldn&#39;t the Germans also celebrate the living legends of their seventies?
Especially since what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award to the still-living members of the Cologne band Can in 2003, the figures of German pop sat in the hall with puzzled faces.
When La Düsseldorf and Neu! he also thanked the ensembles, his amazement became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overloaded by Harmonia if only because the trio existed for only two years, and during that time it had a much smaller impact than what others later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music together with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-financed record company.
Rother helped the band Kraftwerk for a short time, and at the same time, perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu! made a name for himself as a guitarist.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians to their exile in the Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as communes who had fled the city.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius struggled as a babysitter.
Their life is more like an idyllic artist life.
Allegedly, the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein&#39;s band came out of the garbage and this is how they found a name for their art.
Some of these were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is titled &quot;Musik von Harmonia&quot; and the next one is &quot;De Luxe&quot;.
Despite its relaxed and modest music, the band suffered from financial need.
Collecting rocks alone did not ensure finding oneself.
The CD released under the title &quot;Live 1974&quot; was recorded at a concert held in Griessem, in front of a record audience of just under 50 people, that&#39;s how someone remembers it.
The forcing and occasional practice of Harmonia was Rother&#39;s idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its breakup in 1975.
Rother ended up with esoterica and supported himself with albums like &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot;.
Cluster was revived in the 1980s, and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album in Griessem is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company called Grönland set out to nurture krautrock as a specific German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! was also excavated in the same way as Roedelius&#39; solo work.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in Berlin&#39;s House of Cultures.
From public funds, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Also present is Julian Cope, British proto-punk and author of the &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot; handbook.
The creator of Loveparade, Dr. Motte, is also present.
All of this roughly outlines the influence of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the void reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno&#39;s statement floats in the room along with the most unusual voices: &quot;The only true music is the future.&quot;
There are pictures that depict the producer with Harmonia in a room in a farmhouse.
The projection of additional black-and-white photographs of equipment with tangled cabling serves to build the legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
It simply involves attaching microphones to the organ and drum kit with the intention of coaxing never-before-heard sound effects from the instruments using their own escapade sound effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy do-it-yourselfers.
Even the house choir doesn&#39;t change anything about all of this.
Under Barbara Morgenstern&#39;s direction, they cough and pout, and sing &quot;Aaaaaaaah!&quot; with soul in one beautiful part.
After all, krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone shouts &quot;&#39;68!&quot; here, they&#39;re not on the wrong track, and Harmonia doesn&#39;t let itself be thrown off guard by this even now.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully considered on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can make you nervous, or it can gift you with fleeting moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere just isn&#39;t cynical enough
With &quot;The Hunt&quot; and &quot;Mörderischer Frieden&quot;, two films deal with the Balkan war again.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much about action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help with this in &quot;The Hunt&quot;.
First, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, the actor Richard Gere was found again right there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Lately, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, as the many good-guy-nothing roles he played in emotional films for women and the numerous press conferences on the subject of Buddhism took away our desire to even look at him.
And here, suddenly Richard Gere is the most compelling argument in favor of maybe watching &quot;The Hunt&quot; after all. movie.
He gives a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt he plays is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry had not been so kind to him: A man who has long since left his best years behind him, but his decline as a ruin-like monument, it still retains a significant part of its former appeal.
However, the film &quot;Vadaszat&quot; and the German production &quot;Mörderischer Frieden&quot;, which also started screening this week, continue the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war, even in spite of this trump card.
The movie &quot;Mörderischer Frieden&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be wasted: The movie is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from snipers in Kosovo, and one of them even suddenly falls in love with her.
While it&#39;s welcome that for once the Serbs aren&#39;t portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the movie, which carries the shallowness of TV movies, gets lost too quickly in the gunfights and action-packed scenes.
It has a &quot;Cobra 11&quot; character - with war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, in the case of &quot;Vadaszat&quot;, it is possible to examine as an example why not a single really good film about the Balkan war has been made.
The story of the three US war correspondents who set out to find the main Serbian war criminal named &quot;Fox&quot; could have become a new &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in a different era with a different director and screenwriter (both in the personal union of Richard Shepard).
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups take to the forest to accomplish what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness is rounded off.
One of the reasons &quot;The Hunt&quot; fails is that it simply doesn&#39;t let Simon Hunt be the down-to-earth cynic he&#39;s made out to be at the beginning.
No, and as an encore in the script, he even has a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who is later murdered.
The &quot;Hunting&quot; slips away for good when, in the last five minutes of the film, the reporters achieve what NATO, the CIA, and all the world&#39;s bounty hunters have not been able to do in five years: They capture the war criminal and then hand him over to Mohammedan. to Bosnians for the purpose of just revenge.
This is so bad that one would rather go to the International Tribunal in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
Yet the film&#39;s purpose is profoundly human.
He intends to expose the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and that he suspects the Americans and the French (who are said to be exceptionally united on this point) of not continuing the pursuit intensively enough due to secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that one is reminded of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes the following about the wooden mask depicting an Asian demon on his desk: &quot;I stare with compassion at the throbbing vein on his temple, which tells me how tiring it is to be bad.&quot;
Movies like &quot;The Hunt&quot; have the same oversized masks in the shape of human heads, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were abject flops.
We can add: There has not yet been a single good film about South Africa.
It is almost always valid: If a star wanders through the world&#39;s hotbeds of crisis or minefields, something like &quot;Paths of Freedom&quot; with Patricia Arquette, &quot;Without Borders&quot; with Angelina Jolie or &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; with Leonardo Di Caprio comes out of it.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;.
It is likely that some of the films will still mature - since the works about the Vietnam War, which are now considered classics, e.g. The films &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it&#39;s possible that these days, when every mass murder comes to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world&#39;s conflicts.
And it robs screenwriters of the kind of reality-bending that is needed to tell good stories.
After all, &quot;To be or not to be&quot; or &quot;The Dictator&quot; succeeded so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t strive for the good if you want to make a good film.
Perhaps we should place ourselves in the sarcastically distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel &quot;The Lemprière Lexicon&quot; and the Balkan War, he replied: &quot;It&#39;s just that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in horrible ways, and Yugoslavia will always be at war.&quot;
Von Beust is heavily criticized for canceling the Olympics
The mayor&#39;s dissociation from Hamburg&#39;s bid to host the Summer Olympic Games provoked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue fighting for the organization of water games.
Von Beust, however, emphatically warns about the realities when discussing opportunities.
The CEO of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the withdrawal as &quot;unfavorable for the economic environment&quot; on Wednesday.
In recent times, no other project has unleashed such huge motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
&quot;Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain a steady momentum in sports politics.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative &quot;which starts from modified time coordinates&quot;.
Mayor Ole von Beust stood by his previous statements that Hamburg&#39;s ambitions for the Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
&quot;Hamburg does not decide on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association,&quot; von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Confederation&#39;s decision, expected at the beginning of December, on the application submitted for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Munich.
&quot;For us, prioritizing this means that we will have no realistic chances within the period until 2028 that we have thought up so far.&quot;
However, we are not giving up on the dream for good, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over von Beust&#39;s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to bid for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
&quot;It is too early to miss an opportunity by burying our plans now,&quot; HSB president Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The withdrawal from the application is also contrary to the statement of the president of the senate, which he made at the reception held at the General Assembly of the General German College Sports Association.
There, Von Beust characterized the application submitted to the city of Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade as not serving as a supplement to the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only started Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The civic faction of the SPD blamed the Senate for leaving valuable time unused regarding housing construction in Hamburg.
&quot;The Senate has been delaying the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years because it voted for the Olympics and ignored housing construction,&quot; said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD, in relation to Kleiner Grasbrook, continuously advocated for an integrated plan for the Olympic and later residential use, the CDU unilaterally emphasized the &quot;event factor&quot;.
The tender submitted for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games caused great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol&#39;s chests
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden crates is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden chests made in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the catalog of Warhol&#39;s works.
Most of the ninety-four &quot;Stockholm-type&quot; Brillo Boxes listed here are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol&#39;s 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now reached a sobering result: The six &quot; Brillo Box&quot; copy - and most probably also the majority of the hundred other &quot;Stockholm-type&quot; Brillo Boxes on the international art market.
The prehistory is a long and complicated, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial stunts.
Warhol created his first &quot;Brillo Boxes&quot; in New York in 1964 - painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the &quot;Brillo&quot; soap powder cardboard box.
At an exhibition of his works held at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol&#39;s consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited: These (for reasons of cost savings) did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol gave permission for some Brillo paintings to be produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of around fifteen such chests, which at the time, as authenticated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes, went down in the history of art and auctions under the designation &quot;Stockholm type&quot;.
Some have been auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that around one hundred wooden chests were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén&#39;s 105 chests were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
However, by this time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Curator of Moderna Museet, in addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, also examined three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush .
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without priming - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
&quot;These boxes have not been authenticated by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo Boxes,&quot; says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: &quot;Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six chests in its collection as replicas/exhibition material.&quot;
Of course, the Authentication Board already announced in June that it was investigating the &quot;serious allegations&quot; made in connection with soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
The soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave up the rebellion in the Philippines.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, their leader, Antonio Trillanes, told reporters at the hotel, accusing the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Prior to this, the hotel was stormed by soldiers loyal to the government who fired tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly make a deal with 30 sympathizers.
The military police tasked with guarding the man apparently defected to him and joined the mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and then demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Units loyal to the government sealed off the area around the upscale hotel.
The first lady called the security cabinet to an extraordinary meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers&#39; actions.
&quot;People are fed up,&quot; Trillanes said.
&quot;We&#39;re calling on people to join us.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His administration has been overshadowed by accusations of corruption for several months.
As early as 2003, Manila&#39;s financial district was the main scene of an attempted coup against Arroyo organized by around 200 members of the military.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will become a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
As the company announced on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This means ownership of 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were already speculations about the takeover before this.
The possibility of increasing the ownership share acquired in Versatel remains open.
With this step, they intend to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Prior to this, there were already speculations about a possible involvement on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Dusseldorf network provider by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution only reserves the stake for a third party, reports on the money market say.
The day before, United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch issued 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in launching DSL and mobile phone products.
&quot;We are strengthening our partnership,&quot; said a United-Internet spokesperson.
The two companies jointly founded the MSP joint venture in order to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies will initially be satisfied with a ten percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all options open, especially with regard to increasing the stake in Freenet AG, according to the news.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been going on for months and can only be seen with a hint of trouble, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1.27 million customers with DSL and landline access.
Until now, the holding company formed by United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
An agreement has now been reached that Drillisch will bring in another round four percent.
An agreement was reached on the right to purchase 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas back in August.
