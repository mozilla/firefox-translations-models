This not only proves that some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that has been prevalent before, but also reveals details that fossils are usually unable to unravel, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of the animal was maroon at the top, and a light or orange tint on the sides.
The discovery could also provide insight into the evolution of bird plumage.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed handles called stems, but do have other features of feathers — feather fibers and fluff — the researchers concluded that the stems were likely the result of later evolutionary development.
The structure of the pen suggests that it was used not for flight, but for temperature control or conspicuousness. The researchers found that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern refers to adult plumage, not the plumage of a chick.

He is in custody pending the indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised as his portrait has been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of photographs potentially prejudiced.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists are on a dangerous path when they publish photos or similar of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal proceedings, told reporters that they would not speak about the case again before charges were brought.
According to the leaked information, the document refers to the territorial claim Palestine wants based on its borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly covered included the future situation of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley until ten years after the agreement was signed, while PH is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters included in the additional pest control experiment were kept under strict control by rangers as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW) have worked together to recruit trained volunteers for the Shooting Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, said the four shooters selected for the first launch operation had received extensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member interim electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure of elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
About 60 cases have been reported where malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
In its response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's announcement ""sincerely regrettable."
The earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday, 19:19 GMT).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency, no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Monitoring Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police hijacked their bus to capture Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 gun at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, but the deaths of at least six others were confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an old lady as she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps into medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that administering a hormone can accelerate the development of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremity. My first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night. He was very unique, just like himself. She's a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels noted that "Luna was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more so... I love it and will miss it... I hope you're in a better place now."""
Prior to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of 1400 people surveyed who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that King George II would be a member of the European Union. At the end of Queen Elizabeth's kingdom, Australia should become a republic.
34% of voters share the view that King George II will be able to do so. Queen Elizabeth should be Australia's last monarch.
According to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to overcome the pain because he was banned from playing.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using hardware and software, which was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been the largest carriers of water to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, after comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began the governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and stupidity."
Some believe he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to make shorter trips, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport options, ground trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and P+R parking spaces will not be available.
Fears about a lack of delivery raised the possibility of the game being held compulsorily behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, reported the emergence of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported the emergence of a new species by crossing a native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) with a newcomer species, the great cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris). Although until now it was believed that this process would take much longer, the new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even in small sizes.
It can be pulled into thin, easily twisted and twistable wire. It also allows forging or rolling into plates.
It can be shaped very thin and sticks to other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images of "enlightened manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by electron release (since a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then squeeze them into balls with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on our hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange feeling and forming a crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were in company with each other.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the transmission and sends it back to earth almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space on a rocket. Scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the lights and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket taller than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world. The biggest thing we owe to the wheel is that it is much easier and faster to transport.
This brought us the train, car and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized victims, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including pet cats) eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special activity that each cat adheres to, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called packs.
Packs consist of one to three related males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females tend to bond more with each other, being a large family of sisters and girls.
Lion packs surprisingly behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are similar in behavior to lions (but not like other big cats) and are very lethal to their prey.
As a balanced athlete, the tiger is able to climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) belongs to the same group as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four breeds of big cats are the only ones that can howl.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion in full force, but rather like a sentence made up of screaming words.
Ocelots willingly eat small animals. If they are able, they will also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots find them following the smell of animals (prey), sniffing on the ground.
They see very well in the dark, as they have night vision and move stealthily. The panther cat hunts prey by blending into the environment and then pounces on its victim.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they cross to a new island and cannot easily get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are capable of producing oxygen, which humans breathe in and take up carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they give shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most foods are plants that we eat. Without plants, animals would not survive either.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except another mosasaurus.
Its long jaws have over seventy razor-sharp teeth protruding and another row on its palate, so nothing in its path escapes.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
At the same time, he attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive feast dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent, the hazelnut pele.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men liked to feast together, where they ate food by conversing side by side.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered the god's home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and their priests and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower served as a special shrine to the deity.
Due to the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such importance.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
Cooking was done by women in the yard; The shops were just open, street-facing counters. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
The land of Canaan did not have large forests, so wood was an extremely expensive treasure.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norwegian legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there by that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic people, kings, customs, and histories differed in many ways.
If you've seen The National Gold, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were written the words 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document."
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion, the large parchment document (29 and a quarter inches long and 24 and a half inches wide) was stored rolled up.
So it is likely that the markup was simply added as a tag.
The Normandy landings and subsequent fighting liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unfree.
It was dominated by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, dubbing the invasion 'Operation Dragoon.'"
In less than two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture that is shared within a larger group of people who live and work together in one society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin words civilis, civis and civitas, meaning citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter of which also determines to some extent the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over a few generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore unable to recognize them as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first established a weak central government—the Congress being its sole constituent—based on the Charter of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, nor did it have a national executive or judicial body, so it relied on often reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Amendments to the Basic Law required the unanimous consent of all states, but the states did not take the central government seriously to such an extent that their representatives often stayed away from meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world next to the German national football team, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular with Italians competing in the northern regions, international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7000 islands (the largest of them is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Due to the grouping/grouping of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an 'archipelago.'"
The history of Taiwan begins in the fifteenth century, when European sailors passing by record the name of the island - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed indigenous grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western Taiwan and the northern coast and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts, these are Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original look.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was a dominant film size in the twilight of the era of analog film.
It is still in production today, but what is important is that its scale has been adopted by the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The 35mm format actually means, somewhat confusingly, a width of 36 m and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (after dividing by 12 is the easiest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are the same or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the degree of order in an image.
He argues that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
The Christian religion has bound European states together for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and custom. I
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that Church funds should specifically serve this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and seeing this concentration of power and money has left many wondering if its fundamental teaching is being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated general international law enshrined in several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain has undermined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant behaviors of citizens and nations.
Having experienced the horrors and cruelties of war through World War I, nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his old boss).
Ancient China had a peculiar way of presenting different eras: each era and every family in power in the history of China had a characteristic dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, an uncertain era of divided provinces took place. The best known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne fought fiercely with each other.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat at Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political effects of the ten measures, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and faith in the country belong to the people and not to an independent ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prevail.
The same applies to the military, because instead of the rank of the army being determined by class, it was now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working-class members of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad had a deep interest in things beyond worldly life. He regularly visited a cave on the mountain "Noor" (light), which became known as a place of contemplation, called "Hira."
he is the cave that has survived time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, it is not easy to find, even if one knew about its existence. As soon as we get into the cave, there is complete isolation.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. This world is little visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
By the Egyptians in the period of the first century BC. Built in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramids built in honor of dead pharaohs.
"On the Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in Egypt's Valley of the Dead there are several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as several small tombs, numerous temples and the great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "pull up" indicator is V-shaped, and the "pull down" indicator looks like a staple or square that lacks the underside.
Up means you need to start at the tip and press the bow, down means you need to start from the frog (where you hold your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
"Pulling 'up' usually produces a softer sound, while pulling 'down' is stronger and more defined."
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, just remember that printed traction marks are there for musical reasons, so they usually need to be respected.
A terrified Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market goblazers.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages completely.
Suddenly, in front of the terrified queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to American colonial rule to cover most of the costs, and the bonds drifted into Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits came from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, which accounted for the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of order.
The era of events is usually called the late Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000 - 1300).
The advanced Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
In practice, technological determinism involves a wide range of ideas, and the urge to technology or technological necessity strictly creates the feeling that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that, on the other hand, technology has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned."
For example, there is also an opinion that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
At the same time, mass car ownership also leads to high road accident rates, encouraging the invention of new techniques in healthcare to heal injured bodies.
Cultural determinism made up a significant part of Romanticism and drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography modeled individuals, and over time local customs and cultures developed which, being consistent with the location of the community, proved superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world at the time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began in about i.sz 400 and lasted until about i.sz 1100.
Its status deteriorated in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders rejected suspicious gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Paris won the title of the capital of fashion from Constantinople.
The peak period of the Gothic style lasted from the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
The dress at the beginning was strongly influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the West may have lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments as a result of the Crusades was that people began to fasten their clothes using buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques common in the ecoregion to maximize the crop.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of self.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable symbolic style that includes fashion, patterns of behavior, and the use of argo.
One of his most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the example of a few unfortunate children who, through negligence, misfortune or premeditated abuse, could not be socialized in an adult environment as they grew up.
Such children are called wild or unmanageable. Some wild children were isolated by people (often their own parents), sometimes giving up on children was parental rejection due to severe intellectual or physical weakness of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised among animals; Some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a child living in the wild with physical limitations will almost entirely adopt the behavioral patterns of the animal caring for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a way to support those who are embarking on a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or starting a new project.
"Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of 'scaffolding,' but also the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office."
Virtual racks are integrated into the software, the purpose of which is to question, question and explain procedures that would have challenged the student to complete the task independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
A child should never be allowed not to grow up in a nurturing, nurturing and nurturing environment, but it does.
We see foster care as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care is designed for a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable health care system.
Orphanages must provide all the necessities that are missing from the previous home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional opportunities in terms of the use and gratification model.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"'In-person participation' and 'continuing relationships' were also new motivational criteria in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience response to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially if they claim that some people can correctly tell if someone is lying even from certain expressions on the face.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay on The President's Speech, pointed out that people with brain damage who are unable to interpret speech perceive honesty very accurately.
He also argues that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and pronounced.
Mutation allows for new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of explicit variation.
Mixing segregation and recombination, the back-and-forth variation between the two funds for each generation.
Out in the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
What's more, there are serious consequences if this is not met: growth depression, poor nutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to today's chimpanzees in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up from a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of alertness without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock in a dream, move it to the other side of the room, thereby forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which forces a person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace possessed by man contrasts with the degree of tension between body and spirit.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the vitality. Every person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Only our own tension and negativity can prevent us from achieving this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded with the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga origin.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is divinity yoga. By visualizing many deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, differences in systems, methods and cultures led to conflict.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
Over the next 40 years, proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods while hindering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean with men and raw materials to help the English.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagres Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their readily available source of milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that migrated on hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goat herders, similar to more widely known herdsmen. These grazing methods are still used today.
A track track was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of planks laid in parallel, they allowed horses to haul faster and heavier loads on them than on the relatively few bumpy roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used soon enough for the track to maintain its place. At the same time, they slowly realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became an everyday practice, but iron put more strain on the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Man began to walk on two legs two million years ago, simultaneously with the appearance of Homo Erectus (erect man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Bipedal speciations are found in fossils of Australopithecus between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce the suffering of the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind.
Following its introduction to Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages still preserved today are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived. These are birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they are feathered and can fly.
Birds still look similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
They have scaly and clawed legs, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today operate based on handling information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one value out of two, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer parlance.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The surest sign of internal poisoning may be an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for a particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects perfectly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Robber bugs and bed bugs are also nesters, i.e. they are suitable for nesting or use the host.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby
At adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights to have another couple raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using scientific methods. This method, in essence, is the basis of most scientific research.
However, this is not the only thing that this consists of. Experimentation, and an experiment, is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe that also aid scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all spheres of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language proficiency, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the rhythms in physiology and human behavior depend to a large extent on the occurrence of endogenous cycles and their production during the biological cycle.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not mere reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to run free-running cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out in which the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations that develop elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and getting to know Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of small rural towns to get to work, passing by those whose work is where they recently started.
In this dynamic commuter transport, everyone is connected to everyone in some way and supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive carbon dioxide release separated the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; Thus, traffic processes, as a rule, have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a correlation was found between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help design, design, and operate roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to get into the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantageous property of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and requesters can not fold their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristar claimed that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel like the Earth is spinning, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. Its flow is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, 6 miles wide in places.
20 percent of the river water flowing into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never exceeded the size of the Giza pyramids and the excellence of their structure.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were much older than a millennium.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of workers in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, since they can all be discovered in nature in raw material form and can be mined relatively easily by primitive means.
Aristotle, the philosopher, believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more members of the four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, these were four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he thought they would become new substances that we could see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more types of metals. It is noted that there are a huge number of chemical elements in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and similar elements are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain non-metallic elements in small quantities, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit in the dot at the end of a sentence.
Thus, when the pencil appeared, it served many people well.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods developed, the pencil was given a lower status and used less.
People now write messages on computer screens and never get close to a sharpener.
We can only guess what the keyboard will look like if they come up with something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that colliding the nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Re-cleavage of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they sometimes split in two with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km thick on the other side.
It is thinner under the mare regions and thicker under the plateaus.
It is possible that there are more black rocks in its vicinity, because the crust is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what drives them in their environment to do those things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can develop when leaders start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when you're trying to 'stay one of the guys.'" (or babes)."
Such leaders find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary proceedings, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything created by the group and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams measure excellence by the same yardstick as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as contacts for the immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local leadership may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the lead team to whom members report. The invisible team sets the standard for members."
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One of the goals of putting learning concepts into practice among organizations is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of cooperation in overcoming obstacles in the organization leads to a new innovative process designed to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can become innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, this narrows down the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies makes it possible to observe brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models to understand what processes are going on in our minds.
Despite the fact that AI has a strong science fiction surplus meaning, it is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, as well as in the software of many home computers and video games.
Class trips are a big part of any classroom. Teachers often and willingly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology makes virtual excursion possible. Students can view museum artwork, visit an aquarium, or admire any work of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the experience of a class trip virtually with others is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital, the website is revamped every year, but as a commemorative book, old versions are kept available online.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of the audience usually changes that.
Since students often make up the most critical audience, the blogger considers improving writing skills to be key to avoiding criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." Keeping the audience engaged encourages students to be insightful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to Internet material can help students determine their position against what others are writing" and their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's glamorous, bilingual capital and features numerous art exhibitions and museums that explore Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka, an untapped natural beauty.
These, along with many other things, present Ontario in an unadulterated Canadian light to foreigners.
Further north there are vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
A population figure that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of wildlife and can be considered a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or affiliated with France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them to the territories and gained considerable ground in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, and the western and southern parts by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women travelers are advised to identify as married, regardless of marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that seems very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arms, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand on your heels (cultural differences here or there are not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the first century BC in the tenth century BC, and under the name of Anfa, it was also used as a port of strategic importance by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned in 1755 by an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants gave it the name Casablanca and established their trading base here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
In the area of the old medina you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tazins, pots, leather goods, hookahs and all kinds of trinkets, but here everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most streets in the city, mainly in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, visits outside Goma should be preceded by enquiries about the continuing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is the starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano and is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to watch the mountain gorilla.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motortaxi). The usual (local) fare for a shorter trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative seclusion, "Timbuktu" is also used as a metaphor to describe exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it is a tourist attraction and also has an airport due to its reputation.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it exudes an Arab atmosphere rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a different wildlife.
It forms one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
As with all South African national parks, there is a nature conservation and daily entrance fee.
"It may also be useful to purchase a 'Wild Card' to enter either selected South African parks or all South African national parks."
Hong Kong got its name from Hong Kong Island, and this place is the center of attention for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that shape Hong Kong's silhouette resembles a glittering bar chart, accentuated by Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best possible view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite kowloon waterfront.
The urban part of Hong Kong Island is largely densely compacted on land reclaimed along the north coast.
This is the place occupied by English colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove zone in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans have become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But forests aren't just mangrove swamps — they're also home to some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², about a third of which is covered by water/marshland.
The Sundarbans area has served as a wildlife haven since 1966 and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coast buses, which are comfortable and heavy-duty.
A directional taxi is a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, part of French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have 378 meters long and two traffic lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time Brazilian customs clearance points are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters and maintaining subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who made their living from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indians," arose as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization phase, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous traits and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year will take place in December at the Las Cañitas polo track.
Other times of the year also have less prestigious tournaments and matches here.
For tournament news and to purchase tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the only bank on the islands, located opposite FIC West's store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on and around the islands and can often be paid with Stanley debit cards and US dollars.
On more remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may still be taken away. It is advisable to check in advance with the owner what payment method he accepts.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above + 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rain is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to encountering people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how permissive they may seem, bison, vapaitis, moose, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they should be given room to maneuver.
Additionally, it's important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring intensely smelling food with you and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except one British battleship. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is surrounded by two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe to swim on, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is 'Number One'. Not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta.'"
There are plenty of French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better suited to travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, it's easy to find bottled water.
Australians are alien to the concept of 'flat white' coffee. Short black is called 'espresso', a lot of cream is piled on the cappuccino (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate fulfills Belgian expectations. Juices are expensive, but of high quality.
Many visitors come to the reef throughout the year, injuries resulting from this rarely occur.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the instructions of the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish have been found since 1770, between October and April, near beaches and river estuaries. Sometimes they can be found elsewhere in these times.
Sharks do occur, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to move away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat is river estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives you peace of mind that you'll have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have unique offers on certain hotels, although it is possible that you can book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can even reserve the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents (such as visa) for your destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most even consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get to a camping spot close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the concert on the main stage is over, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play well into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as sailing between the ice can make terrible noise for those who are too close.
Part of the St. Petersburg boulevards is sightseeing. Ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions)-
Casinos usually make a number of efforts to maximize the time spent and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows and clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and in the room.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are also offered at the expense of the house. Drunkenness, on the other hand, impairs one's judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
All drivers at high altitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't ride on them like on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause a jam.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide an outstanding experience for visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land travel, designed to see fascinating African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars, so they can be well observed even with average equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footwalking") consists of hiking for a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not covered July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with tickets typically priced around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes will help drying. In many hotels you can find irons and ironing boards that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, some of them are more effective against characteristic threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it takes more time.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are worried, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals they may not have encountered before in their homes.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, as well as spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means the purchase of goods at certain locations free of tax and contributions.
Travellers to tax-heavy countries can sometimes save significant sums of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging in terms of driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated areas behind God's back.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: steep climbs, narrow lanes and sharp turns characterize the road.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent stages — usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is paramount.
Interestingly, however, the signal strength is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, e.g. in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are very good, in Bavaria they are made quite richly and diversely, in which they resemble their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked in cakes all year round, cherries and plums in summer.
However, many German bakery products contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. More popular pastries are often well associated with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but hearty cakes, try what is called, depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, prepared with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'soupy' depending on how much liquid it contains."
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used to make curries.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for the vast variety of cuisines in the country's region.
However, when used without other qualifications, the term mostly refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely present throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple seasonings, with Javanese flavours dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hanging down on either side of the saddle hold the rider's feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns as the rider's foot may get caught in it.
If the horse drops the rider but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag him with him if he gallops on. To minimize this risk, we can take a number of safety precautions.
First of all, most racers wear smooth, narrow-soled riding boots with heels.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup belt to fall from the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cochamo Valley is Chile's outstanding climbing destination, known as Yosemite in South America, with various large granite walls and crevices.
From the peaks of the mountaintops there is a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on walls with endless possibilities.
Snow downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including downhill skiing on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, its fans are sometimes referred to as "skiing lovers" and plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave drawings of skiers can be traced back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: Also called backcountry skiing, hiking skiing or ski touring.
It is connected to, but usually does not involve an Alpine-style ski tour or climbing, the latter are done on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Interpret the ski route as if it were a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than walking - but you will rarely reach the speed required for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-groomed pistes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, transit through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you usually don't need to go through additional passport checkpoints when crossing borders.
Similarly, a Schengen visa does not require you to change a visa for each Schengen Member State, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of which objects produced are antiques. Some tax offices define antiques as items older than 100 years.
The definition varies from geographical location to location, with some age being shorter than in Europe, such as North America.
Handicraft products could be defined as antique objects, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming was, and still is, an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the business is important to many people in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, mostly using reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region in the city of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you're trying to visit is the subject of a travel warning, your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.

Extreme weather is an umbrella term for any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social disruption or even death.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in several types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are the manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, along with thunderstorms, tornadoes, water funnels and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of severe weather risks in the area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country classified as a war zone should undergo professional training beforehand.
If you search online for 'Hostile Environment Course', you'll probably get the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documentation for the return journey.
Governments differ on whether they are willing to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or to issue documents that contain the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Screenings at security checkpoints became much more disruptive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people about to undergo surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be violated when passing through a body scanner.
Return currents are the recurrent flows of waves breaking away from the coast, often at a reef or similar.
Under the influence of the underwater topology, the return flow is compressed in some deeper sections, and a rapid current can form in deep water there.
Most deaths are due to fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back to shore is no longer as difficult as usual.
Try to target a place where you won't be carried away by the drift again, or - depending on your capabilities and whether you were spotted - you may want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs much earlier than culture shock (smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own original culture again.
Upon returning home after spending time abroad, he adapts to the new culture and abandons some customs from the home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding with you, and were aware that travelers visiting an unfamiliar country would have to adapt.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and silent even before the show starts.

The Sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by many countries and have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with Villa Las Estrellas.
These include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of the still active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge with the plateau and rise again, forming a 360km chain of Ellsworth Mountains bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel range, is Antarctica's highest mountain range, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892m Vinston Mountain.
In remote locations where there is no mobile signal, a satellite phone may be the only solution.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for mobile phones, as a phone call requires being outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used for shipping, including pleasure boating, as well as expeditions that require data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone service provider can give you more information about how to connect to the service.
An increasingly popular option is the so-called gap year for travel and study.
This is especially popular among graduates, allowing them to skip a year before university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, taking a course abroad in a missed year can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Participation in these educational programs is usually tuition-free.
"Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of small islands in the area of lakes and coastal archipelagoes."
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough to yacht with, smaller boats or even kayaks are a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one in seven or eight people owns a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite specific (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the featured Baltic Sea cruises offer a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, spending the night on the boat.
If you only land on boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures also include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is the same as personal fears or dislike something - a lot of people do.
For some, a partial understanding of how aircraft operate and what happens in flight can help overcome fear rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for fast delivery. Time is key for business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but there have been problems with other routes and smaller companies.
If things are sent by air freight, then on some routes it may have taken days for the goods to be unloaded and get through customs.

The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to scoop up a thick stack of banknotes for privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the standard fare in business class and eleven times the standard fare in first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats between points A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay large sums of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the arbitrary proclamation of the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With about 3.7 million inhabitants, İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Please keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site that is almost invaluable to part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time there, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or forced to work there to death, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat the place with the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the site by drawing graffiti or scratching into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the markings are only in Catalan because, according to the law, it is the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro can only be heard in Catalan, but unexpected disturbances can be heard through an automated system in several languages, e.g. Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as egocentric, impolite and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as best you can: as someone who has a "bien elevé" (a good upbringing). This will make things much easier for us.
The crude behavior of Parisians quickly disappears if we follow some basic courtesy formulas.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very forested, mostly a mixture of beech trees, spruce trees, conifers and alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

Rare fauna can be found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and deaf grouse, as well as many other more common species
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts covering the knees, and also cover shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the kit at the entrance, but clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits every man!

Pre-modernization observatories are obsolete and are becoming museums or educational sites.
In their heyday, light pollution wasn't that much of a problem, so they are mostly found in cities or university areas, in more accessible locations than their modern-day counterparts.
Most of modern research telescopes are a huge apparatus in an isolated area with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most popular flowers.
