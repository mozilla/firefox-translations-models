The Prague Stock Exchange was down by the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after a rapid fall in the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (SEZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall from the start of Tuesday’s trading on Monday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street’s stock drop is behind the decline.
This is how the market is manifested in this way about the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which rejected the support of the stabilization plan of the financial sector there.
Shares fall in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually canceled some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng stock market index in Hong Kong described almost four percent during trading, but later canceled some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent and markets in Shanghai closed.
The stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but losses fell to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue mission is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Finance Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should resume talks immediately and accept the financial system’s aid proposal.
Otherwise, there is a threat to other countries who can sense the consequences of this.
Bloodbath of U.S. Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a draft of the financial system support, to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns) should have been spent.
Legislators have thus ignored President George Bush’s call for support for the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar drop was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House of Representatives, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdrew: U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and George W. President Bush’s government has agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
But there is no victory.
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Senate sources say the draft is likely to be expected to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
Economists say it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the revival of the financial markets.
Thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, "sound sobriety" will take place thereafter.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We took a big step.
“We have unravelled our different views on the form of the market stabilisation package,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat to the Bloomberg agency.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form to a government fund.
This should be acquiring from financial companies the unsellable mortgages that bring financial firms into heavy losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
“We are close to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The redress plan needs to be continued, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal of Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling fiercely.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the lawmakers are therefore striving to reach an agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is what they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress’ decision could be the first to influence Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor will it whether the trial could not be found at the last minute due to any problems.
Legislators hope the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount to be used to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
As President George Bush’s request, the first USD 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
Congress, however, could block the issuance of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional USD 100 billion and later USD 350 billion if it feels that the program will not fulfill its function.
Bush Reveals Progress in Negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may overrule his veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program remained, which was the acquisition of material assets to acquire the acquisition of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush’s spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy.”
Restrictions on bustard severance payments
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate’s banking committee, said the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the discounts and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called bushy severance payments of the directors participating in the program and establishes a committee supervising the fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury Department.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made a big step forward in an agreement that will work and that will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also takes into account the help of homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government would have to negotiate new installments on the mortgages it has purchased, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
The proposed draft, David Marek, the chief economist at Patria Finance, said it was a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
“All this because it is not known by the mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will distribute losses among themselves,” Marek told the iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it is so uninteresting that the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is much more important that Congress decides this week that the plan will be supported and will give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement on the plan being approved is the most important thing at the moment,” Marek said.
Winning of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The weakening of the two parties of the Grand Coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday brought.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
In contrast, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial leader of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the country’s strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but lost 5.5% of the vote compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, losing nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and especially the People’s Party, which has caused early elections, is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP coalition was leaving the ÖVP coalition, the EPP had a significant advantage in front of the SPÖ, according to opinion polls.
However, the electorate seemed to punish him for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of party chairman Wilhelm Molterer and current vice-chancellor.
Observers believe this could be held on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18% of the votes in advance and the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - but the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the repetition of the 1999 year, when the EPP agreed to a joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still unified in 2005), but the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the repetition of the 1999 year, when the EPP agreed on a joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still unified in 2005).
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, which, however, lost some popularity and dropped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not reach the parliament.
Pair fight edge: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We will help you how to choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons for getting a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It is probably hard to get a high-quality expensive turntable for home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if its shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, you probably dream of such a turntable.
This is similar to the travel, that is, compressed - simply with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to release 8,000 crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20-crew market earphone.
There are two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
There is a wide selection.
The lifespan of the elements also counts
Some top-notch music players can do much more than simply playing music, but also for which most mobile phones are by no means.
No device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and text message, you can also play music and video, both, have a better-bad camera in it, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, as no refrigerator can grill and no television can take photos.
Multi-functional mobile phones also have disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more the display sends it to the charger.
And music playback is one of the greatest energy-eating.
Few mobile devices are able to play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, you should count on not playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you even make a phone call here and there, get a charger for your workplace just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
There will be no such problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
The Next Problem Does It Come Up When You're Uploading Music to Mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB outlet and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be fixed directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without an adapter with the miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
With a few exceptions (iPod) for players, you do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most of the mobiles and players already create a music library that is ranked according to the artist himself, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user’s rating.
Some devices only show a fast-of-life tour similar to Windows Explorer, and some can both (irvers, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific equipment, ask primarily about the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of audio output, and of course the comfort of the operation.
If the music primarily serves as a background for you and listens to it for a short time a day, for example, on the tram, any MP3 player mobile phone will also suit you.
And now any mobile can do that.
You don’t even have to pay close attention to which music formats your mobile or player can use.
Each of the MP3 will be coped and the vast majority of the music you get to you will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most common, and the vast majority of devices can also cope with WMA music.
AAC (format used by Apple and iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow for online music purchases.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and purchase the song or the album.
This service can be a powerful argument for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is lousy and is usually limited to annual radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it can be assumed that the music industry will dominate the same way of selling music (either on GSM, the Internet or via the wireless internet) in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel your mobile phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the earphones or at least the hands-free ones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with which almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, music phones are probably the biggest advantage of the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
Between three and 4,000 crowns, you can get quite a decent walkman.
However, you are usually limited by the lack of the output of the traditional headset.
The best and technically equipped phones with the traditional 3.5 mm holes can cost up to 15,000 crowns.
However, the advantage of players is ease of use.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily the handling of the cheapest players (see our choice) is really coped with everyone.
Minimum function, handling similar to the previously usual cassette tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of a accidentally switched on mobile internet and no huge invoice for data transmission.
What kind of device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually has a slot for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By purchasing the appropriate card, it can also fit into a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful, though.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy an MP3 player, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) You do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile pamens (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment is approached to the MP3 player.
The largest in the sector is Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for its walkman-sequeum mobile phones as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our service providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Despite this, we lack something here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be much longer.
We have already written on Mobil.cz that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the “TOUR”, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than that of the other countries of the Union.
After the recent move of the European Commission, this may lead to a controversial situation in order to regulate roaming charges – some of the customers of Czech mobile operators’ text messages will be cheaper than the domestic ones.
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is far above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvorak, the president of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council, also agrees with this, who has previously stated a few times that there is no room for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider probably doesn’t have a lot of chances with its own network (in all, it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one more option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought a significant price decrease, and then the classic service providers had to react.
Meanwhile, even before the big fish entered the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, sounds similar to ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we don’t have to go too far.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
To operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world generally appear as low-cost ones - they offer cheap calls and text messages, which is often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages that are at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it is quite a good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider focuses on men.
“True men choose Mobilking – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual service provider.
It is hard to say whether an idea similar to that of Poland can work in Hungary.
A spokesperson for Vodafone, Miroslav, a spokesperson for Vodafone, doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
It is also relatively satisfied in terms of the supply of services."
There is no chance in the Czech Republic, according to mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region,” Jana Studnisková, spokeswoman for the Financial Group, told Mobil.cz.
This indirectly demonstrated that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competition can be achieved.
The GTS Novera Group has not been a secret for some time to keep its interest in launching a virtual service provider, which aims to take another step to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers not only with fixed line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe it's better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider is lucky by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this moment, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider has a place in the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been addressed by an uneven subject, which offers complex and serious projects in this field,” Vlastimil Sr?e?, the press department of Telefónica 02, told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, said: “Until now, we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which we could be based on it.”
And he added: “Study on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual provider will appear.
At the moment, we should have a concrete agreement on our table so that it can be thought so short-term.”
Vodafone’s attention is more focused on fulfilling its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav adds: "We are open to negotiating with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider to be the most paying for customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy is to partner in this area to build networks shared for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - on one string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another service provider would mean an increase in competition, leading to a price decrease and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When it comes to service providers, they are able to cooperate, the struggle around the birth of the U:fon is also testifying.
The biggest pressure on the T-Mobile company’s U:fon is probably about the birth of the U:fon of T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the website of the “TION”.
But right now, the U:fon comes in handy as a good argument as a reason why we shouldn’t allow the virtual provider to log in.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment of the mobile market competition has recently been unravelled by the market of the fourth mobile operator’s market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would be high in the market and its services."
However, given such attitudes by mobile operators, the total disinterest of the Czech regulators is astonishing.
In the meantime, it is not only about the attitude of the “TOUR”, which, unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
Only the Hungarian Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a characteristic attitude towards the whole problem.
“The virtual service provider’s mobile market could only be concluded after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers,” said Kristián Chlapua, the Foreign Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and make sure that no one can abuse its market position, this is more than strange.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the outskirts where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile phone services.”
It is likely, however, that the pressure on the market environment and the decrease in prices is not presumably in the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the resilience of the three mobile operators is indeed shocking.
The question is whether it is only a coincidence, it is almost self-evident.
Just like the completely identical gasoline prices at the filling stations are just the work of chance and hard competition.
“The Office did not discover signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. they have no proportionately greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market of virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecoms regulator,” said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leader situation is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the TUR, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
After that, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has a monopoly on its own network, relatively logically.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we didn’t accept this argument, ÚOHS would have to be at least a warning that three mobile operators are acting remarkably similarly.
Meanwhile, complaints from the inquirers (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that there are very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the TUR is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunication Act, the extension of the powers of the scope of the “TION in the field of economic competition” in the telecommunications industry could not be carried out, although many experts hoped for an improvement in the situation.
Representatives of the ÚOHS need to know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching
Meanwhile, the operation of some pseudo-virtual service providers will be unnoticed, of which many of them already operate in the mobile networks of the Czech Republic.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
They are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer in the face of the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a privileged customer, you will then receive special quotations (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-sales.
“If there were cases that you are talking about, the terms of the terms that we would be dealing with, and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with the company concerned,” Martina Kemrová said in response to a question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that the news of such activity did not reach the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending itself against such a procedure.
They have not insignificant profits from the activities of these companies, and they do not pose a particular threat to their own official marketing, unlike real virtual service providers.
Miroslav “epick” warns of possible problems: “The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that their phone does not contain the SIM card in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as generic customers of mobile operators.”
But that's what the Way should be at least strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why do they hinder the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to expose such activity, and if you do not want to, you do not have to be content with the service providers’ explanation that they did not suspect anything of this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers to the mobile market has resulted in a noticeable decrease in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in practically all countries where virtual service providers were established, the classic service providers tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - a market that was too small, possibly too satisfied, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at this very moment that the regulatory bodies intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Then, with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual service provider that others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are serving the whole case with each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies come in handy for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will be available to us soon, the Czech mobile market may be in motion again.
If a service provider would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS would be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be going to make any more expensive calls.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the Day of the Czech Statehood solemnly presented my Where is my country? New national anthem's new recordings.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre, led by Jisí Batachies.
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, chouldrons or instrumentally.
They sing Katesina Knínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Yeremi? and Jaroslav Kraek.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Blohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young singers with a representative voice to sing solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried to pay attention to the pure diction, the clear comprehension of the text and the harmony of both of them, and later at the band,” he said.
The Czech state anthem will celebrate 175 next year. anniversary.
The song "Where is my country?" was first performed at the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kaytán's Tyl Fidlovaka, complemented by the music of Frantisek's kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
The first verse of the song, after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, became a natural part of the state anthem.
Even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "new" anthem
The Prague transport company will deliver chip cards for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, he will enter himself as the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger enters the subways, trams and buses, whose electronic coupon will be in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can be saved on their chip cards at the information centers and branches of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M?stek, Nádrasí Holesovice, Andzl, Roztyly, Letsany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon.
Those who start using online trading can finally forget the publishing windows of the metro stations, where they have to regularly stand through long lines for the line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased over the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers are at the disposal of a desk with trained servers who help those interested in online shopping and save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrn, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons will be saved for Opencard in the self-service vending machines installed in some lobby.
What do these machines look like?
Reds, reminded me of ticket handlers, and the passengers may have already noticed them in Roztyly, Bud?jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn said.
The coupon is checked by an automatic instead of the driver
Managing the automatics starting tomorrow is easy.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously paid out is saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the residents of the districts of Central Bohemia to the capital.
"On the trains classified in Prague, the guides were equipped with card readers, with the help of which they also determine the belt of the coupons," explained the control of the line gaps from the Ropid organization, which compiled the schedule of public transport in Prague.
In the buses around the city, card readers are installed at the cash desk at the manager.
Therefore, when boarding, the driver should not only show the chip card, but also to place the Opencard in a specified space on the side of the cash desk.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the simplest is to ask the driver to do so," he added to Drá.
Passengers who do not run buses around the city and will not remember when the validity of their coupon expires again, can go back to the self-service vending machines that save the coupons for cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudder wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans asked for the annexation of the United States in 1945.
This is revealed by a letter from the collection of the South Bohemia Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This can be seen from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemia Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Kunrumlov are asking the US president not to allow the re-return of the “Caumava County” to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops come to the German territories not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter is “People who care about the fate of ‘mava’.”
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia to the Sudist Germans, in addition to knowing the Czech national character, can only give hope to brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over ?umava “now and forever”.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this area would be considered a country that oppresses and devastates the minority and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors could not sign is supposedly fear of the desire for revenge for "Czech oppressors."
So if the President of the United States allegedly doubts the opinion of the Germans in Ecuma, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the county of February about whether his residents would like to become part of the United States and whether they want to live during the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive with the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe that it adequately portrays the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to know minimally that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to agree on an autonomousity.
Others were hoping to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in Budsjovice.
Chalupa served as a German from Budjovice in the Sea of the Baltic Sea during the war.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and thrown into the detention camp in Holstsko, dozens of other Czech Germans to teach them Czechs.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they would benefit from the Czech language," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be evacuated from the country on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The emotional campaign is attacking leaders
In Czech history, it is the most expensive action to ensure road safety.
The emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could also be characterised.
The office of the Minister of the Bishops of Ale the Bishops hopes that this campaign will deter the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will be on television, radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
Drivers should be discouraged from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them of their seat belts before they leave.
First of all, it wants to speak to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional leaders.
What is reflected in the advertisements?
Emotion-increasing, primarily human stories.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The term "you're not thinking" on the license plate is written in capital letters.
And in the pool of blood, the word "pays" is mentioned.
This must symbolize the fact that one can pay with one’s life for a moment of inattention.
The viewers are "refy" by the advertising spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can regularly watch drastic images of victims of accidents.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let the drivers go
"The driver's system is valid for 'drach, let go'.
'Delete it for them, for example, when they go through the red light, saving time.
'Stretch' is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kosan, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, according to the psychologist.
According to him, the signs that draw the driver’s attention to the danger is less effective.
“If the danger warning sign is installed, it is likely that it will soon merge with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it,” Kocan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Provisional Israeli Government, spoke about the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, from the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that the Jedi Achronot published daily on Monday.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that we have to return almost all, if not all (occupied) territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians will have to hand over a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return includes East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants safety in Jerusalem, and above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to walk through their feet, as happened with one of my best friends, they must give up a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two July cities, in which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to the “temple of the Temple Mount, holy and historical places” located in the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the withdrawal of Israelis from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not recommend a peace treaty with Syria solely on the basis of its withdrawal from Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must give up the regular support they provide to terrorism between Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq,” the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal beetle collection had not been solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said Czech-Indian relations could lead to a certain estrangement.
The Minister announced this in New York after his meeting with Pranáb Mukherji, his partner in India, today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be some estrangement," he said after the meeting, which took place from Czech incentives.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Swach, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, in whose law the case falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
However, for Emil Kusera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for release on bail and expect the verdict to be sent, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way is how the Czech side can intervene in the whole case, to grant “competent legal support” to the convicted person, the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such help.
“It is in our best interest to preserve the best relationships with many years of tradition with India.
This is acknowledged by the Indians,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the TK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We are indeed calling the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistake,” he said.
Asked if he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
“I’ve already received a lot of promises,” he said.
Questions after an accident: Are flight attendants illegal in buses?
The law does not know them, you should not walk in long-distance buses
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could drive on the bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally abide by the law, the flight attendant’s activity is in contradiction with the Transport Act,” says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation.
Last week, the driver of a truck crossing the bus was probably the cause of the death of a twenty-two-year-old flight attendant.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment, she was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place on the bus, although there were two more places for her.
The bus may collide or brake suddenly at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role to determine whether the bus has a standing place according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers will have to sit.
The Student Agency's long-distance buses do not have a standing location; which was confirmed by Radim Jansura, the director of the company, to Aktuáln.cz.
“We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first they did not allow the movement of the passengers.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to toilets during the voyage, if they have their own seats,” he said.
The law does not know the flight attendant.
"There is no clear legal scrub on the role of the flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by law from providing services.
The Law on Road Traffic only knows the concept of a haunt; it does not define its rights and obligations,” Hanzelka, a spokesman, adds less clearly.
Josef Pokorna, director of the road vehicle operation department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law handles the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus registration certificate has a standing point.
And that's the end of it," he says.
Buses may be discriminated against as such as cities where there are standing places and limited maximum speeds and permitted highs for cities and at higher speeds, and long-distance without standing and with maximum approved speeds, seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
Transport safety expert Jaroslav Hosín, BESIP, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
“There is not much danger in continuous progress, the situation can be compared to the service on the plane.
It is not even certain when there is turbulence and the flight attendant can smash his head.”
“But if the bus brakes suddenly, of course, the laws of physics will apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of the flight attendants must be solved by the carrier with internal rules,” he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan?ura is ready to stop the services
The Student Agency offers flight services as the only bus carrier.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
The principal does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
“As I have the impression that the occupation of the flight attendants is risky, I will eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers when boarding.
That would save money,” he says.
Alexei Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants in his vehicles with security interests.
“We don’t have flight attendants, we’re against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury,” he told T?den.cz less than a year ago.
Incredible Tragedy Happened
The young flight attendant who has been working for the company for two years died during a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the emergency lane without using a turn signal and blocked the bus’s journey.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to bypassed him with a manoeuvre, but the right front of the bus crashed into him.
That the two reserved places for the flight attendants were to be sold were sold, Jansura refused.
"These places cannot be booked on long-distance flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck manager.
By indemnifying the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s judgment, but expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
Amendment to the law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movement of the flight attendants on board the bus could be the amendment of the law, which has been working for more than a year by the thirty expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
“The group did not get any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum permissible speed on the motorway and the mobile use while driving,” says expert Hosín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, adding that the control of bus safety is within the competence of the police and the labour offices.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It walks to the wall electronic map, which can be seen in Australia and neighboring sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the neighboring seabed.
In the meantime, the area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to a group of 30 members of the United Nations Division’s ocean and maritime law cases.
His boss, Václav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, director of the division, is following the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
There is a momentum and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources and has hardly been known.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but also by previously unknown living organisms, which may be the key to the development of anti-cancer medicine, for example.
Sea floor greater than land
Today, coastal states are applying intensively for new submarine areas.
According to the UN Convention, their rights are being enforced, which was agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends a few hundred kilometers from the shores of the country.
Such a country shall have the exclusive right under the Convention to all the sources of the continental shelf.
"To put it simply, we hold that part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental shelf which is the natural continuation of the submarine continent.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, so-called only economic zone border,” explains Mikulka.
The application, submitted by the country to the Commission designating the external borders of the Continental Pasta, shall be supplemented by extensive scientific-technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is legal and professional-technical assistance to the committee.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success recently attracted an echo, which was the first to significantly expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed awarded to the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, or six times larger than the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean floor, which is declared a "celeethic heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive situation.
The right to be extracted in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that “one of its territories are legally defined and their regime is contractually bound.
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed is now also the Czech Republic.
This is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
According to the Convention, in 1991, as with investors from some other countries, this organization received the so-called "pioneer investor" status.
You are entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area screened by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is articulated there, a kind of undersea copy of the Tatras.
“This can be used in an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetalical ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the division’s Macedonian, shows the example of another concrete.
It reminds me of a potato or a little imagination to parchment with magic words that bring Goal to life.
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurt
The WestLB board of directors’ letter to the bank’s staff is not short of the big words.
The merger of the units of the Dusseldorf financial institution and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create a “central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group”, the letter published on Monday writes.
WestLB would bring a permanently lucrative "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give the decisive impetus to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors seeking to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The vague WestLB bank is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the Landesy Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is tight.
However, for savings bank clients, Deka-Bank, famous for its investment funds, and WestLB, it has been a topic of a kind of relationship for a long time – from Frankfurt’s part.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, announced at the end of August that the bank on Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not see the point of merging the bank of Mainzer Landstrasse.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which consists of one half of which are representatives of the provincial banks and the other half by the representatives of the savings banks, has commissioned the board of directors to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
In doing so, the capital market business or parts thereof may be considered.
Negotiations, however, have only just begun, financial circles.
With its 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not come up for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank would be merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pafalz and Helaba.
But this three-way alliance did not turn out to be anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessian provincial government spoke out against Helaba’s interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Palatinate was transferred to Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised again and again.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is true that there is a need to approach various banks in the public sector.
Now, after the Bavarian provincial elections, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are the first to be seen.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure on further fusions increases, it may slowly run out for potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, even though the financial crisis has so far been significantly more experienced than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who had an 85% business stake in Hebaba.
NordLB will remain better.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and the Zsíró Association had not yet answered the decisive question of the business model with which the future of the provincial banks should be ensured.
Finally, it is possible to dismember the WestLB, which is obviously not desired there.
Thus, the letter of the directorate there also states that they are looking for a “full solution”.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
This is the first time Elena is the third or fourth time for Luca.
Now Elena is here as her friend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, in addition to the Kaiser brand five-litre barrel, there is a man with a strong-bodied beard, and he insists on the 200 people travelling to Oktoberfest what deep sounds he can draw from his throat.
Elena first wins Luca's face, then kisses her.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova, four buses depart from the parking lot at 23.45 with the aim of "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", and arrival is expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans had already started to sing next to their flag, and they had already started the celebrations during the night.
And so loudly, it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long, faux-lined coat and wide silver-stemmed glasses.
He has been travelling to Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he has organized three trips.
Overnight, during the day, at the Oktoberfest, home at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would be an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German-language guided tours in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Cleanliness Act - Marco has completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already throwing themselves into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, no beer.
The bus quickly quiets and the passengers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
A rest is being held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on the 8th motorway are taking a short break ahead of Munich.
When Marco’s team arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., there are already nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving one last briefing, presenting the plan.
First, everyone wear the yellow hat.
On the left side of this is the inscription "Oktoberfest" written in the letters of fracturing, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
"When the gates of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying the places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we are stuck, and not sit at the same benches with all yellow hats, but let's spread out in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, Marco screams.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show me to the security guards that you're behaving well.
As you leave your place, they take them.”
Third, "Tonight, at 11:30 p.m., be back here again." Do you understand?
And we're on the way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men, as a road signpost, tied yellow caps to the trees, on the signs, and even on the election poster of one of the great Bavarian People’s Party.
You have to be prepared for a retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; they talk about 50,000 people who are crossing the Alps in the beer tents, and ten percent of all the visitors of the weekend are reportedly coming from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers are assisting the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics takes the first place by the Italians with about 200 medical care, ahead of the Austrians (approx. 80) and the British were pushed to the bottom of the podium (approx. 60).
The Hofbrau beer tent is especially popular among the Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word “relatively” and even cherished his message that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Munich has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person who knows the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amount to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes from private and partly from public banks.
The loss of the Depfa subsidiary is behind.
According to a newspaper news report, Depfa, who carried out state financing, lent money to long-term projects and refinanced himself to these extremely short-term – which is now not possible due to the lack of trust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity also fell moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net income from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenues from credits and specific securities, and revenues from the liquidation of the debt business’s provisions fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Thanks only to higher revenues from the reimbursement of the subsequent settlement costs of the transformation of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest rates under the Fee Regulation and the shops brought to the companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively modest revenue deficit of only moderate.
Following the privatization in 1990, the former state-financed director first speculated with corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
Since little could be earned by classical state funding, Depfa plunged more strongly into infrastructure projects and private investors and state joint projects (PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now needs to perform descriptions of the group’s profit and loss, they said in quite general terms.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
The dividend has been reduced to a third in 2007.
Since the takeover of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funder.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the banks’ lending between them dried up as banks retain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance some of the Depfa loan portfolios, some EUR 50 billion.
Hypo Real Estate said in a statement that the group’s financing needs are covered for the run-up to the loan, and the company is protected from “influence from the influence of international financial markets that are currently largely inoperable.”
According to other sources, the money is provided for refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, said that the Hypo Real Estate group would not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now insured.
This gives the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, it is not certain.
It is not even inconceivable that there is no need to fully use the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, after the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, bond rates are quite good.
While the first-placed debts barely change, the prices of the bonds ordered back have fallen significantly.
The crisis concerns in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo and, in achiviably, the maturity of the previous subsidiary, which extends beyond the year 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value-resistance should now be considered conditional on the stability of the international financial system due to the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis home by taking Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the repayment of annuities can be based on the deadline.
Or it will happen that almost no one at the moment dares to fight the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in the face of the reports related to partial nationalisation, the probability, which is now bound by certainty, has now become a mere rightary herd.
Long-term creditors may be decided to divest themselves of their investment in sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to reserve taxes on the exchange rate gains of the coming years.
German Special Forces at Hostage
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis, and experts came.
When the situation became treacherous, the special units were ready, but they did not take action.
More and more details are coming to light about the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Department, and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were also at the site of the rescue.
According to ministry spokesmen on Monday evening, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized the signs of the violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to involve it as an on-site support force.
“Ffortunately, this did not happen,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers abducted a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight of their Egyptian escorts on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the South Egypt desert area, the hostages were dragged back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear so far, as have the details of the release of the hostages or any ransom payments.
In the meantime, the rescuers arrived in Cairo safely.
Steinmeier said the rescued hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there is no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the daily newspaper "Bild", the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on the Airbus of the German Air Harderők on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the boarding box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German chick is totally "small"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange student-blog, she talks about Japan.
“The first day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on fire to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and I take 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I wasn’t lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachybana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start to rave at 8:00 a.m. until a short conversation with the teacher begins at 8:40 a.m., the "home room".
But before the teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my landlord, a blouse, a blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the chair in this dress, and I tried to pronounce everything right: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." My name is Sylvava, I'm from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, giggling, and waving, and I kept hearing the word "cockachi."
I already knew that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide, feeling it was an honor to have her seated next to the exchange students.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the bell rang, they rushed to pass.
Everyone was talking nonsense and laughing, and their questions drilled a hole in my belly—which is rather difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their boarding house.
My host made such a lunch for me - this is completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, salads made from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu-rolled meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
The food looks strange and they have a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe with the exception of the salty plum preserve, brrrrrr!
In Japanese schools, the local is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade boarder with his own hands, which he compiles especially artistically - in the hope that he can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can see this here.
"Why is it Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because he's fascinated me."
After all, I've been wanting to read manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
I am attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're very cherished here.
Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends on the one hand – and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the greatest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The House of Commons of the U.S. Congress has overthrowed a small majority of the 700 billion dollar bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the depths.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout for the financial markets by 227 votes against 206.
George W. Despite the calls of US President Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets has not received a majority.
Supporters desperately attempted to convince critics of the 700-billion-dollar package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, a Democrat party leader, called on the MPs to support him, even if the plan is unpopular.
“It is difficult to obtain political support to avoid something that has not yet happened,” he admitted.
Dow Jones fell by more than 6% and 600 points, respectively.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote was completed, and then fell again after failure was made public.
Experts expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats have emotions too.
A rat or a moth escapes in case of danger. Does that mean you feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we see if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
Famous scientists have published their articles in the online journal "Edge" for years.
In one of its series, SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without you knowing?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and discuss the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in a difficult terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, which suggests comparable subjective experiences.
I don’t believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human-related circuits almost always contain the side prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide area is higher in humans than in the case of other primates, and it seems that other organisms are completely absent.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cerebral cortex, such as the consciousness of who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from even the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is associated with language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals can be excluded.
However, even if consciousness is not dependent on language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its kind, is probably strongly different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research will put us in serious problems.
Most of my discussions refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The processes of the animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in the assumption, which was also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, rely on the neural connections of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be the same or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cerebral cortex in the creation of visualization.
What does that mean for emotions?
I am going back to the fact that an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in the brain, which is aware of its own activities.
What we call "fear," is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions), occupies a working memory.
Thus, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
Completion is divided into subtle degrees in the linguistic way, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states in order to describe them alongside others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the cerebral cortex and brain-sense areas, as do Jaak Pankseep, who, however, prefers to focus on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that encompasse species.
I can't possibly refute this, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is probably the same: How can you check whether rats and people feel the same way?
A cockroach escapes in case of danger, do you feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have the same brains, cockroaches don’t even have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if it could be proven in terms of humans: how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, and maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove it.
And because their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I research the emotional behavior of rats rather than its emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don’t research language and consciousness in the case of rats, I don’t know if they exist.
For others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I would rather move forward than constantly hit a wall.
I am a practical emoctetary.
Platini, President of UEFA: Courage for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vasjunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship together with Poland,” Vaszjunik said.
“This does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now,” said Grigory Susaki, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
“UEFA will keep an eye on us.”
In Poland, they took an even more radical step.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by independent supervising commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewieck.
“There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
“In the Spirit, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that it would not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Commission.”
Only in the last season had to be classified as a number of first league teams due to manipulation, and in the end the league had to be postponed.
More and more bookings are registered.
A good winter is promised to German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic of road seizures for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical prospects, the Germans’ travel mood is not declining, according to the study.
Travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year’s period for winter season bookings, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was around 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the amount of bookings increased by about a third.
The particularly popular destinations of the Germans are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
“Organizations are mostly in demand,” said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, in the case of organised trips, costs are "better calculated for passengers than on individually organised trips."
Passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, among other things, Laepple added.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to record traffic growth again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook to travel than in the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her personal life - and now she has a problem with her ex-husband. Hollywood star And Ryan has described her ex-husband, Dennis Quaide, as an adulterer.
Who is frothing - and retaliates
The Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-age couple: The two Hollywood actors are fighting a nasty battle in public seven years after their divorce.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan said for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain.”
It wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him.
The spiritual striptease was due to Ryan's new press work on his film "Women", which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid reacted firmly to his disloyal husband’s proclamation: “It’s terrible,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, “that Meg is unsatisfied and rescheduled to repeat and respending the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it is “deplorable” that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are once again “publicly reminded of the pain and the change that divorce causes a child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a twin.
So his answer ends with the following page cut: "My life will continue anyway.
I must be happy to have a wonderful family in which everything is in order.”
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have become more favorable again – summarizing the results of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter’s price increase.
After the prices in the hotel market have risen for years, the accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly seen in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to the “slow travel mood of American tourists”.
The decline in hotel room prices is more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 25.3 percent increase in hotel prices is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in the price of airline tickets in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class airline tickets decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first division prices only showed a much more modest change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they declined by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany has halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the decline in the price is due to moderate economic growth, the company says.
Demand in many segments of the flight market has weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe is intensifying the pressure exerted by the competitive situation.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their loss-making flights and several airlines declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV was placed at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning team.
Kristoffer Klein's enlargement is a deepdown for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only got into play late, and his raise bounced from the goalpost.
His very message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed said Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were sitting in place again.
Rieger had the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying more prestige than some former players.
His request was heard at the place where he was asked.
Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg manager Martin Jol.
His orders must have said the same thing: Here's the second goal!
The order was not executed.
“Today it wasn’t always a nice sight,” Jansen said later.
Bastian Reinhardt also "loops the loose" thing.
The 1:0 (1: 0) goal score is due to the head of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachers could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a skeptical victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which represented their team as the first of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” Jansen said.
He knows that the mid-certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slow to recover from its lately committed acquisitions – the Brazilian Renes and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern’s Jansen – but he is not yet brilliant.
“We need more sense and tricks,” Jol demanded.
My first Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted ballermann hits, literal jar beers and design celebrities wearing dirndli.
Debut on Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look alike.
He's a blonde, a TV presenter, and he's wearing a tailor-made dirndli.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the shop.
But one thing connects us: We’ve only been on Wiesn for three minutes, and we’ve been rushed by photographers and filling their memory cards – I’m very flattered, and all this on Wiesn on my first visit.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist native to the equator of white sausages, my comfort is still limited to folk costume.
But when you arrive at Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndli or leather trousers; no one looks away from arrogance or embarrassingly - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are just my dirndli apron.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I had the wrong knitted the apron: "You are free on the loose, virgin in the middle, sold out on the right, widow at the back."
I secretly tied the bow from behind to left.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others make less fuss around the fine flirting techniques and wear a simple filttboard with the inscription "I'm too drunk to dress up" and unsolicitedly point their naked buttocks.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob and visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, stretching for a long time.
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previously drunken jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants, which everyone considers to be garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the notorious "protylish urinators."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
By eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics walk the scene in an army and take care of the poor mist.
Caregivers always appear in a team - four people carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works as in most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, leaving full.
Who is lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarp is not visible.
“These are those who are completely ready,” one of the medics shouted to me, then in the bustle.
After the vote
Wall Street is covered by fear.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, the Dow Jones temporarily fell 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow became somewhat stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important barometer was good at 5 percent minus and stood at 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, a tech paper trader, fell to 1,548 points with more than 7% minus.
The Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
Not a piece of paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs Bank’s shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett had bought a stake in the bank.
Within the framework of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive the vouchers of the financial institutions, which could be used if the exchange rates were properly developed, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and American and share prices
Billionaire aid to European and American banks does not dispel investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and it captivates Dax.
The American Dow Jones index is declining despite the state-planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock ratio (Dax) into the minus.
The value of the Munich real estate fundraising stock fell by a quarter despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax fell below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and scored 5839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Stock markets have been forced to kneel around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the U.S. government’s 700-billion-dollar bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, down 3.3 percent to 10,099.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges are only known in one direction: in London, the FTSE index showed a 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
The Sal. The private bank Oppenheimer has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said that the shares of Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark material influences space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been a compressive phenomenon among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity should not be entirely correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" flew in space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the soon-to-be-freezing fuel lines, he is threatened with frostbite.
Scientists have been in turmoil for years by a mysterious phenomenon, a swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational swinger of space probes, which gains additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This way probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
What has been astonishing the researchers for years: Flying objects don’t behave completely as would be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are disorders in speed.
The probes are suddenly accelerated or slowed down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was christened a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, concluding the gravitational pull of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter, which the astronauts discovered in the universe.
“The anomaly can be caused by dark matter, which may be found all the way to Earth,” Adler wrote.
The existence of dark matter was only known to the existence of dark matter by space scientists ten years ago.
It obviously exerts a gravitational force that can be observed in its effect on other celestial bodies.
But matter itself is completely invisible, i.e., it does not emit or reflect any visible light, or repositories.
Scientists have calculated that a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt freed
After spending ten days in captivity by their kidnappers, tourists deported in Egypt are once again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
Six hostage-takers were reportedly killed in the shooting before the release of the hostages.
Five German nationals were kidnapped in South Egypt.
The ransoms are already under negotiation.
Again and again Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists deported in the Sahara are free.
Egyptian state television, Al-Arabia, and Italian media reported.
According to Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: “Our fellow soldiers and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently looking at their health,” Frattini said.
The five German, five Italians and one Romanian citizens, as well as eight of their Egyptian escorts, are safe and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
19 participants in the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
Egyptian security official said the hostages were already in a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was just about taking the hostages," when suddenly "the surprise."
On Sunday, Sudan soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper “Al-Masri al-Jom”, citing a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage-takers will release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
Men are held captive by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
Police named the victim of the accident.
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, was involved in the crash on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
He was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
"It led to suicide" by the Mosthapathic Violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, who lives in Stithians, Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight reports of violent rape.
The Trouron Criminal Court has learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the age of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's testimony, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, it was said that at the age of 34, Randle committed suicide at his home in Plymouth’s Mutley district, 2007. April 1st.
When he was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied up and tied his eyes before intercourse while his mother was working in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as her home.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust’s monuments, was persecuted by the horrors of violence that repeated twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionately wanted to surf and ride a bike, said her friends were “emotional dead” and “resigned from life.”
2007. In April, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was in a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter: "I have always tied up and bound her eyes.
I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I’m sure it was terrible for you, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
But the fact that if he hadn’t done so, the case might never have been tried.”
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to the impact of Stephanie’s parents’ parents on the impact of the crime committed by your daughter over the years.
If that hadn’t happened, he would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
The official who lost important data was indicted
According to the BBC, a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June has been accused of violating official secrecy.
The man was posted by the Ministry of Defence when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest accusation of violating the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional crime.
Frank Gardner, a BBC reporter to the Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many at Whitehall.
“They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
The employee who cannot be named was charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the retention of information.
The state prosecutor’s office suggested that the indictment against the official should be represented by the Metropolitan Police for his rather sensitive work on the Unified Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost also included secret surveys of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved to an unknown location from his home.
Housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
UK housing-building cooperatives can expect an account of more than 80 million pounds after saving the bank Bradford & Kamp; Bingley.
The government has spent 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford &amp's deposits at Bingley.
The interest rates on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 home-building cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), said it was “an arment” that companies and their members had to pay.
The loan of 14 billion pounds will eventually be refunded after Bradford &amp; Bingley’s mortgages have been repaid.
However, the interest accumulating in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System confirmed to the BBC that the 59 home-building cooperatives are among them.
It is frustrating that the institutions, which have been acting carefully... now have to pay the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that every company has to pay in the same proportion as it holds the amount of deposit. Companies share 18% of the costs.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside GBP 81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the housing association’s union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that institutions that have acted carefully during the recovery of the housing market should pay the bills of institutions that acted carefully during the recovery of the housing market.”
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since they started operating in 1945.
“We need to look at this case in the next few weeks to determine how we can protect housing companies and their members from a significant account,” Cole said.
The interest rate due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full annual interest rate, which can be as much as twice as much as you can now.
Since home-building cooperatives, without self-help organizations, shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates received on their deposits.
Turkey's Expanding Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial aspirations stands.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the ends of the platforms, with a tower at each front corner, and looks like some German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little slapping.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious that this was the westernmost gateway to what large-scale undertaking it was.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future of conquests", wanted to achieve its ambitions to capture the Middle East with the help of the railway leading from Damascus to Baghdad, to today's Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest struggles collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Lawrence and Arab partisans of Arabia.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and displaced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station didn't do better.
In 1917, an ammunition-carrying train exploded and destroyed the beautifully crafted roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed and history has gone far beyond.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party of the Government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of twirment, which at the time gave the rhythm of the famous documentary "The Night Mail" about the old world - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended to be a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the past of the there.
However, the AKP, known with Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern, made of stone and steel, a specially designed building - standing in a developing suburban district, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, middle managers in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been appropriated for a centre-right politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
“The Cold War has upset order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today it had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both directions.
“But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?”
"Turkey never wanted to be at a crossroads."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here, almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations with not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, have the same advantage of Europe and the United States as they do to Turkey itself.
It is as if they were trying to convey the message that, in a figurative sense, together with Turkey, all over Europe can reach those east-seaside railways to Asia and the Middle East.
When I was again at Hydarpasha Station, after another night mostly awake, I thought of the two German gentlemen who watched the building of this ornate building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited for the ferry in the harbour to take me back through the Bosphorus, it occurred to me that Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
At least at that time, there was no question which continent should claim this exciting country.
The price of milk increases by five pennies per liter
People in Jersey have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and after a survey conducted by a consulting company.
Resellers will decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh MP’s request to defend himself free
The Bangladeshi court has dismissed the request for defence for the release of former MP Sheikh Hasina, which means he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court denied him the free defence against the charge of extortioning 50 million takes from a businessman during his parliamentary membership.
This case is just one of the many corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina, her long-standing political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demands that the country’s military-backed interim government should give her full freedom first.
According to the reports, although he was released on parole so that he could go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of placing him on the open foot that he can keep his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal the Supreme Court against the decision of the court of appeal.
“The Court of Appeal has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail request by saying that it is not necessary, as she has been temporarily released and is undergoing treatment abroad,” Huq said.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself at the free of charge in order to return to the country and to prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed interim government took over, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia denial all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination program in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children from Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organized polio vaccination program due to violence in the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccine in six provinces.
However, they said they could not get to children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this was despite the fact that the Taliban had pledged not to attack or hinder the work of thousands of personnel who were vaccinated.
BSkyB appeals against ITV have been rejected
BskyB’s appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Commission, which instructed him to reduce his interest on the rival television station, ITV.
The Court of Appeals of Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission found that BSkyB’s shareholding hinders competition and gave the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, in the acquisition of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share of BSkyB from ITV had jeopardised the independence of ITV, urging the Competition Law Committee to launch an investigation.
Virgin Director Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom oversight, all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that forced the reduction of ITV share is meaningless and disproportionate reparations, especially considering that BSkyB said it would be willing to give up its right to vote.
New investigation into U.S. State Prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. Attorneys.
The move followed the fact that the report prepared by the Superintendent of the Ministry of Justice on the case criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state prosecutors had been fired for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials heard during the investigation have tried to block the judiciary with a lie.
“Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated and unclear,” said Glenn Fine, Superintendent.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the power to oblige witnesses to testify.
The series began with nine U.S. attorneys removed from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, they said that the state prosecutors were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed state prosecutors were not given any worse assessments than many of their other colleagues. For this reason, many have come to the conclusion that there was political consideration behind the redundancies.
Some state prosecutors have been involved in criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican members, while others refused to take part in investigating allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys is investigating the government and conducting court cases.
They can be fired at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their positions.
At the time, the head of the Justice Department, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks for the dismissal and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Justice Department also resigned.
In his report, the Superintendent strongly criticized Gonzales’s role in the case. According to him, the Attorney General bears “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, his role as “resigned” of the leader, and “resigned himself out of the process conspicuously”.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush Sr.'s assistant, are criticized for failing to cooperate in the investigation.
Meat Loaf eposza receives recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive an award at the Q Awards for her epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive a special gold medal at the London ceremony next week, said he would consider the award to be an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second-long song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977, trench album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, with four nominations on the nominees.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like this.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a very big sound, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental stage.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the charts for almost nine years, and it sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, is now facing health problems. Among other things, he underwent surgery in 2003 due to his arrhythmia after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it turned out that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others are merely in a practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and local residents who have lived here for a long time would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and headed north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about. It is 9 m wide and 36 m long and is much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
You can't find a standard map.
The street has admirers.
It is there, for example, the Avalon Bay, the recently built of the built Front Street luxury buildings.
He wants to rebuild Extra Place and ensure that the stores and boutiques of new buildings can be accessed on a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are the long-haul neighbors who were caught in the truncated street, that it was the only remnant from the past of the area before the renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building-preservation and development department of the city.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s territorial management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the 3rd self-government body, said.
“There are very few areas in the possession of the city, and we want Extra Place to remain the city’s,” he said.
“There may be any proposals for renovating and handling that Avalon can do, but we also want to guarantee that it remains accessible to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to rebuild the small street and take seats. Some of these would be used by a cafe, the builder is expected to rent out an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first published in this month’s session.
A spokesman for Avalon Bay, Michele de Milly, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on its possession.
“The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this run-down alley and turn it into a pleasant public place,” he said, adding that the city had proposed its purchase.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Bureau, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of buildings, not the management of the building.
Compared to its colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place is not of much historical significance.
Some say it was named "Nobody's Land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back exit of CBGB, the back of CBGB, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place, and perhaps the most notable is the most notable of the fact that the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia" was taken there.
“It was a great location,” said Danny Fields, Ramones’s manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of rubbish, splinters of clothes, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle-class took possession of East Village, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest as it is, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, which is a piece of the city that remains practically unchanged and must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog "The Disappearance of Jeremiah the Descendances" ("Book of Ladies: the "Bird Nostalgia" describing the process of the city's extinction), posted on his blog part of the story about Extra Place, which was published in the "The New Yorker" column "Városi rumour" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extoral Place is a narrow, small dead end that is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty, iron warehouse doors and splintered windows, and where one-week-old newspapers are carried by the wind in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran over the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75 liter beer bottle lay next to a fresh newspaper dumped.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think they could use a renovation.
Fields said some people underestimated his attractiveness in the current state of the street.
“I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places,” he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
Educational Monitor in this part of Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discusses the opinion of the candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and senior director of education research, co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choices”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education include this.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Fro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
To overcome such differences in performance, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “temporary bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, overcomes his interest in overcoming big performance differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, a contracted elementary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students of the school are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Despite this, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state math exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have passed the English language and literature exam excellently.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s education principle is a “full immersion” of students in English in the language environment.
The essence of the method of immersion is the almost exclusive use of the English language in the teaching of other objects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: “We have had a huge success in the fact that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t notice who the student who had come from Mexico 12 months earlier.”
"He's working," he said, "It works for us."
Would Obama put schools like Sixth Street Prep as an example to other schools with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English students?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, but because of the education policy of their own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it consistently supports bilingual education itself, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently said he was devalued when he said that people should not be so concerned about the “exclusive English nature” of the legislature.
Instead, he said, "They should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the gap between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Oil prices fell sharply due to recurrence of economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply over concerns that the U.S. financial market rescue plan would not be able to revitalize the economy.
The crude oil securities dropped seven percent to 99.80 dollars in the morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been shaken by the Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached USD 145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped almost USD 90 per barrel earlier this month before falling again under the influence of the immense uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, the concern again seized investors even after the leaders of the congress announced that they had reached an agreement this weekend on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest in history to date.
Concerns have been overwoned the news that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation’s banking business as the latest event of the unfolding crisis, the government announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend talks, “it seems that the rescue campaign has not succeeded in reviving the trading mood on the stock market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for commodities, such as oil, will also decrease.
“The future of the ordinary shares, interest rates and exchange rates market has become uncertain around the world,” an analyst at Deutsche Bank wrote to investors.
“We don’t think the commodity market will be avoided by the ‘epidemic’.
The biggest question from the point of view of the commodity is the extent to which the “disease” of the United States is infecting the world, especially China.
As oil consumption declined as a slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team set its record
After spending more time in the Jets in the last eight seasons than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in a defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the unfolding of the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals' lassic games were in full harmony with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre gave a quarterback 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became a perfect forerunner of an afternoon in which their unfolding cooperation was significantly further developed.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks lost 10 seconds in a row to the end of the half.
“I didn’t feel sorry for the effort,” Favre said of all the passes to Coles.
“He’s a good player.
We’ve been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback player Darrelle Revis grabbed a bad throw and threw it back with 32 yards, which hit a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting a 34:0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter.
When asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both of them -- the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter without the Jets -- Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short time.”
The rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best mid- and long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday. He became the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a comfortable win in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 for 27 seconds, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his career in such a wide range that he won the World Championships from 1500m to marathon, or reached a world record for almost every distance.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that, in retrospect, perhaps too cautious, would further aggravate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, initially at 9oC and at the end at 13 degrees Celsius -- won on Sunday, with incredible speeds of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since runners on the marathon, such as runners. Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, with a marathon record dropping by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won a 2:06:05 win in Berlin in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago his two legs cramped and could not train for two weeks.
It's obvious that during the forced rest he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything has gone well.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything was fine.”
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival, that he uses too many aids during his races, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his pacemakers as if he were running on track and placing world records in front of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes the magnificence of Gebrselassie in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint in 1:02:04 on Sunday with four Kenyan runners.
Two Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers ahead of the finish, Gebrselassie overtook Kwambai with a final sprint, finishing second with 2:05:36, improving his personal best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third under 2:07:48.
In the women’s competition, Kazakh-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, had a remarkable year with her seventh fastest 2:19:19:19 win.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a surprise with a 2:24:14 result.
He was not allowed to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his personal record by five minutes. This was the third marathon in a marathon.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed an Ethiopian and Kenyan group of four to advance and gain significant leadership, and then to gain a significant lead, then about. After 30 km, he followed them.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and ordeal of the blacks
In the Greater Orlando theme park – a few miles away from everything that sparkles, loud and huge – hides a quiet little town where the pride and complications of African-American life experiences were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country and was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as he described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guany, and two schools without a prison."
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival. The Eveonville celebrations are held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city it describes and has become a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers of the Crisis Age Project, is separated from its environment.
It is as independent, dignified and closed as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that Florida and urban blacks often refused to share their real thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even the same year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of the looks of outsiders.
“We are very careful how our story is told,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of black people’s stand, but it is a community of almost 2,400 people where poverty rates reach double the national average.
It is partly a literary hub, and partly an example of American slavery, sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that blooms in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (almost everyone calls Hurston like it).
In books written in a sincere, strong dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which is located on Route 17. This is the way from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites in the history of blacks and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature, as well as drum rolls, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, with a white border on a brown background, carefully held yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares for, though he can hardly read and write."
He mentioned the widow's new husband Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "is selling all kinds of drinks and anything you need in temporary shelters."
Thus, Hurston has linked Eatonville to autonomy in a few hundred words, but also with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
I really didn’t like that description.
“Zora said things the way they were,” said Ella Dinkins, 90-year-old, a Johnson girl. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a booming Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in long trousers, a city where people are still proud of their dignity.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many people were bascaled.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he said, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were not re-released.
Eatonville, along with most of the world, seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes is a contemporary and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he had previously lived.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood how much they enriched the world or what he left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 book Hurston’s “Painted Enforcement.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Officials in Orange County wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community’s life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, fighting about racial mixing with the community tasted hatred.
“At the time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road,” Franklin said.
“There was a lady who died from it.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to "The Orlando Sentinel", Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's ruling on violent integration. This is what the "Brown v. Board of Education: "It's more insulting than respecting my race."
Today, the inhabitants say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the people of the Eunaphonville and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
“Black children are accustomed to being hugged – that’s what I remember – you hugged your teacher in the morning and in the evening,” N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the non-profit organization "We Preserve Eatonville's Community".
“It lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common ground,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rises—in black writers, actors, and artists who have risen above prejudices, as he did, with optimised self-confidence and lines such as, ‘How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight back her fame.
Five years later, a Robert E was placed on the shelves of bookstores. Hemenway wrote acclaimed, acclaimed book by Hurston, which once again made him one of America's role models.
The road construction project was to start at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw him as savior.
The community began organising a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans have arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the ceremony every January since.
Several years later, the county withdrew from its road construction proposal.
“Because of the five laxification of the main road, the community has revived, it has shifted to full speed, which is a real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city of itself.
More and more people living outside the city appeared, such as the number of people living outside the city. Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending church in 1993, began re-evaluating the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-storey library (named after Hurston), re-covered and beautified Kennedy Avenue, was opened.
Eatonville still has Florida's cuckoo, less than ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; it's as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They still take care of outsiders who come here in search of the story of Eatonville, who come here in search of the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things, such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to vivid red, are afraid that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown grew.
Young people, especially see Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with his problems and everything better, not as worse, not as badly, as proudly, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is a sincere civic connection from Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work with the local government or the police, which he believes is in need of help.
And it seems that the younger ones have also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Kenon said recently after the service on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, then this is a very beautiful city."
We here in New York all speak the language of finance
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with the glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, the bankers and venture capital managers who hold New York in their power are living the most difficult days since 1929.
The couriers still roar their metallic carriages on the sidewalks, transporting trays loaded with muffins for the morning meetings.
Still Spanish-slip men are shuffling among the blocks of flats, carrying like human mules fifty-some of the iron-out shirt that hangs on their shoulders, a verb-like loop.
Office workers are still queuing up for their sweet pastry in the morning at the carts on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn’t feel that there was any crisis until I decided to open a new bank account on Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news.
Although I deliberately planned to do it during the afternoon calmness in my JP Morgan Chase bank, I already had about 20 people in front of me.
Not at the bank note’s window where money can be withdrawn or deposited, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy’s store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many people, I learned later from Starr, the banker “assigned,” were in line with the same intention as I did.
Unlike me, however, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called savings banks (such as housing-building cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
Last year, 15 such banks have gone quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of 327 billion dollars, has been compromised, and when New Yorkers headed home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank rescuer with savings of 440 billion dollars.
The office and shop workers in front of me, afraid of another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, a bank that is doing most of the capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
The simple New Yorkers have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store on her phone talked about the bankrupt bank of Lehman Brothers and the huge-looking CEO of Dick Fuld as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed caretaker of my apartment, treading in his fifties, changed the topic, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment, as we do.
He said to me after I was at the bank: "I invested all my savings in money instruments.
I switched, I'm not taking risks."
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: since 1962, as the music director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley (unabled, Sept. 11.) led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical designs for the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 – many of us were already at the end of our 20s – we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-variator) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music that was placed in front of it - whether it is a madrigal or a piece of Messiaen; unaccompanied or accompanied by a grand orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration to music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "Let's let the music sound by itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
Everything is in the sheet music.
So sing it!"
His conductor technique has always been completely understandable and accurate, but he is never dictatorial or excessive.
Whatever the level of music, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If there ever was a choir leader who should have been knighted, Vernon Handley was.
I got to know him well in the two decades in which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty years, I've written criticism of more than 100 concerts, but he's never disappointed me with one, and he's often made them think of them.
Tod Handley had the greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated those armisticemen who, in his words, simply “got with one well-known battlehors all over the world with one well-known battlehorse.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary William Woodruff (25 September), he continued his studies in economic history in Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became a fellow of the Houblon-Norman research institute... while he was constantly preparing for a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree, and a PhD title.”
This comes from the authors of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime J. D. Under the leadership of Professor Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he was indeed in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at Illinois, New York, and Harvard universities.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff has been beautified this period of his career.
Muslim tombs were heated as Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in which the organization "Customers Against the Conquest of Islam" was introduced.
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed with a red line.
According to the police, the extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which happened on the same weekend when far-right parties significantly advanced in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traunum Cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday evening and this morning. Police say it's an organized action.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some tombs, but according to investigators, they only tried to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” when they heard the grave defame, which happened shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a review of conscience following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance has tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, a highly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18% of the vote, expressed a campaign against headscarves and burqas, as well as his displeasure with the foods that are allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party’s final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of “European fraternity”, which prevents the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the far-right victory, the change was due to the largely young electoral base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from travelling abroad
Garry Glittert, a well-known rock star convicted of rape of children, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities inspecting him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
The Kenyan police obtained a ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of rape against Glitter.
Glitter, really known as Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent police filed a petition with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities about his intention to travel abroad because he was obliged to do so by the law on those who do not include sex offenders.
You should notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You also have to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If it does not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to up to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent police said they did not want to talk about their individual cases in Glitter County and his whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police Department said: “The Kent police are doing everything possible to protect the children within the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to check someone out if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system to manage potential risks more effectively.
“The Kent police have the most important task of protecting Kent’s population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons registered in the perpetrators of sexual offences and living in the county in order to minimise the possible risks to the population.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The provincial authorities did not allow him to pass the passport investigation, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the provincial police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the West London Court of West London, as he was admitted to the register of sexual offenders under a court order under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK for possession of photographs of raping children in 1999.
According to a Ministry of the Interior Ministry, Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of State for the Interior, was reassured and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take the photos on stage, because I would like to introduce the artist from a personal hand" Günther Bauer Photo Artist
No sets, no braids, no dancing shoes.
The grand masters of flamenco up close, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary person.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments far from the audience, when we can learn a personal movement, we can grasp the depth of a captured gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the artist who is about to perform the stage, which is not preparing for his stage performance.
In the German photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, the unique iconography of flamenco is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, “reflects the growing international significance of flamenco every day,” the artist believes, adding that the Flamenco-people “can be the character of anyone, since the observer realizes that these images do not depict the artists in a typical way.
These people caught in the street are artists who are able to take passion, sadness and cheerfulness to the stage... and captivate the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character dwell in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera.”
With the impetus of the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on his long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a camera.
These portraits evoke classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of theme.
However, the use of various stylistic tools breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer’s idea of flamenco: “This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes and is always impressive.”
It is not dance, nor the singing or music in itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist enchant the audience.
Recently, the guiding motif of the works that can be seen in the El Photomatic Gallery is the search for an encounter with the essentials, the artistic warraiser, which becomes visible through the mode of perception, existence and representation.
The well-known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are hallmarking this photo collection presenting these almost sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco-anthology, of which an album will soon be released covering the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauert’s passion for portraits was inspired by the “Portraits of Vereteran Athletes” series to repeat the idea.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people differs slightly from this, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, you meet, you bring together with personalities that you sometimes don’t even know, or who only spend a few minutes on photography.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition, which was selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled Flamenco-people, will be on view in the El Photomata Gallery at the El Photomata Gallery, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules 20, until 16 October.
According to Llosa Vargas, the novel he works on is "auded recklessness"
The location and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working to write his new novel. The protagonist of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and has also been to the Amazon.
The author, who also holds a Nobel Prize in Literature, admitted at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work is “ready recklessness” and “all signs that the novel should not be written”.
“If I was smarter, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope I’ll be able to put an end to it sometime,” he concluded his presentation at the festival of ideas, thought and opinions that welcomed hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he lived up to his expectations.
Llosa Vargas won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our "Common Friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After Felix Romeo's welcome, he was greeted by a devoted audience. The clock quickly flew away for the audience, during which the Peruvian writer, with astonishing memory and a high degree of humour, told us how his writing profession developed from the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how to bridge the lack of inspiration through a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, a lot of corrections and rewriting; how the story of the story of Faulk.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but added: “I don’t think that literature is mere amusement or a blooming experience,” because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to take responsibility for their vocation.
Due to the harsh weather, the farewell to Pozoblanco is shorter, the horse bullfights are also cancelled
Traditionally, the horse bullfight, traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco holidays, was cancelled from the show yesterday morning, after the future horse-riding bullfighters found the arena’s terrain unsuitable for the competition.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided that the bullfight was cancelled.
The weather vehement severely damaged the series of celebrations, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was cancelled due to the rain.
Pro-selling protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with bulls in Castilblanc.
So it wasn't until Friday that they had bullfighting.
The winner was Daniel Luque, bringing home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was taken around on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante’s two bulls made a number of accolades and an ear as a trophy, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, this was followed by El Juli, who made little contribution to the appreciation of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable ride, we managed to get the majority of the audience out of the middle.
A truck carrying two tons of hashish in Avara tried to escape from roadside check
Four hours at 50 minutes in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police conducts traffic checks in the administrative area of Armibon (Álava).
The authorities stop a van in which two people are in. Passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, but was not conspicuous.
Investigators chased the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and A. A. He was identified as J., according to the Internal Affairs Department of the Basque government.
The man was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armicón, where the employees of the Álavai Traffic Inspectorate carried out a traffic check on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and left the scene of the inspection.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away on the emergency lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its shipment, 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish bales, which filled the back of the vehicle, were moved by the police to undergo a more thorough examination and to measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection proved that the vehicle’s fake license plate does not match the data in the paperwork of the van, so the arrested person is also prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation, the purpose of which is, on the one hand, to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the highway, and on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A. A. J. was taken to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the judicial measures were also started.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Leading Under the Effect of Drugs
Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda in the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police over the weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
According to an eyewitness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, a spokesman for the California traffic control told People magazine.
According to the eyewitness, at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "should the throttle up the heat, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forward and backwards, and several times in reverse, he crossed his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the eyewitness, who at first probably didn’t recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
"It looked like a vart," so patrols took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
A police spokeswoman said the actress was cooperative and that alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesman also said that the officers’ first impressions were believed to have been under the influence of Locklear’s drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on IU (United Left) andalusian federation to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federalist of the corps will make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Counselor of the Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of abusing his position to give his family benefits.
“In these things, I am a broadly federalist, and this matter is the responsibility of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out in the manner of proceedings that the party must apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that in the course of detecting any irregularities that Silva may have committed, it is necessary to keep in mind "transparency": "At IU has always advocated that such matters are fully transparent."
He added that the trainings include “a strict code of ethics for civil servants.”
"May Blood", epic work by Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdos’s National Epistles, José Luis Garci, who evokes the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in May, which, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros, is the most beautiful film of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flood of people and social analysis he had always admired in his well-known novelist’s work. At the film premiere, Garci told all this at the film premiere, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May blood will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will be screened as a miniseries for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdós’s literature, achieved his childhood dream with this filming. All this was due to Esperanza Aguira, who commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the events of 2nd May in Madrid 200. anniversary. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the story was based on the National Epistles.
The budget of 15 million was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: he could present with a period set and costume the "witted Spaniards who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence plunged the country into a huge backwardness. With the reign of Ferdinand,” he said.
However, the director expressed regret that he could not count on the budgets of the phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, who was more than doubled in May. For this reason, he was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, like many other occasions, is recorded together with Valcárcell Horacio.
So the director of the Restart resorted to his usual way of working, he shot the scenes with the actors with whom he had already started rehearsals before filming. Casting wasn't there, because Garci thinks it was "humiliating," and because, as he said, "the director's craft is part of going to the theater and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
This is not the first time many actors in May’s blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrasaga or Fernando Guillene Cuervo, who have stepped in front of his camera.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and an Oscar, believes that this year’s nominees representing Spain, i.e. the May Blood, the Seven French Billiards Table and the Blind Sunflowers, who finally selected, represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “although it should be presented,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this film.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for posterity, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and finally you’re happy if you’re going to have another movie,” Garci says with a career of 30 years behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the Catalan father (Floren Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana quarter and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Oriental dances.
During his busy life, he pioneered women's equality, including Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the wearing of a corset that prevented the freedom of women's movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pope Gambo, he recommended my attention to Torah, whose personality really impressed me.”
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell the story of her life, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, about the "cholar dance" of the goosei, or the "snake of the snake" tango.
“He danced in his sense and others think that’s what characterizes my style,” he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing again after the Open Door at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Totala, the mature woman.
I’m glad you said yes to the invitation, I’m very honored to perform in my play.”
The production also includes music directors and guitarists Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pájaro, Jeroe, and Juanfra Juárez, actor who "plays the true diva with his love," and "play a permanent character that is constantly besieging the real diva with his love."
The play also largely presents the life of the woman, who lives in London, but also travels to Europe and reaches the landscapes that were still far away at that time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a big impact on his own age, but nowadays he is not known and even less appreciated,” Bayón says.
The performance starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at Lope de Vega.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
"J. Vicente Resino’s exhibition “Flamenco and Life” is recommended because his black and white, documentary-like-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that emanated from them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is permeated by emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a newly married poet" also appears
The first illustrated edition of the diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobo in May 1916. The presentation is part of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) series of programmes organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andaluus Regional Government on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two of them.
In this way, the closing chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-issue of the above-mentioned work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Memorial House of the Nobel Prize-winning poet, and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Summer Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, has visited several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York for the duration of the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andaluus Regional Government has acquired a total of 800 copies of the diary of a newly married poet published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the fame and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and inertia caused by Newman’s death in the American cinema and throughout America.
It was so hard for him to get the Oscars.
Retired in 2007,
He was well known to be sick,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
“Sometimes it’s impossible to put our feelings into words, and I’ve lost a good friend,” Redford said in tears, “His well has made my life better and that country.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or overdoing.
One of the heroes of the cinema and the homeland went away during a particularly dark period, which was overshadowed by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people we can look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men he embodied the ideal of pseudo-sightedness of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation in memory of his first-born son, who died of a drug overdose, to the creation of his home-style organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that found it difficult to get over its suicidal culture of nutrition.
The overwhelming wave of admiration has traveled all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
According to James Bond, Daniel Craig of England, it was not one man, but an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He set the bar very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today: they demand honesty and serious and remote privacy.
This is not always easy, if at all, in the midst of today's media jungle.
Yet some are trying, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He divorced once, but then lived in fidelity with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, even though he would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
“Why eat hamburgers elsewhere when roast meat is waiting for you at home?” he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters are also fans of yours, which is not very common in America.
“He was not as proud of any of his performances as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted philanthropist,” they say.
The Rugly Road of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 failed, it could become 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really up to it?
Because if we start from yesterday's running race, I don't think we're at all.
They called it the perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of the many I've ever been on.
He was characterized by a multitude of meaninglessness, and once he had to be evaluated and the examiner, it would be a failure.
But let's go and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the receipt of the serial number, because it had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in the future).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first, only the serial number was handed over (first meaninglessness, only so it should go there sooner) and (after the usual queue), how surprising it was only an S-shirt (second meaninglessness, since I have exactly XL in size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save on the material and buy only cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that we had to go there at an early age, the queue took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed in.
The wait lasted for more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet. When it finally succeeded, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, which was dotted with popular uprising and stagnant attempts.
I think we'll get about 500 people with pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, don't get our place with our actual time. I assume my chip incorrectly recorded the start.
If you ask me about the perfect running race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of --not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that, however, is capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle in the company’s territory) based on the information you may hear from the conversation.
With the help of a camera and a design and facial recognition system, this "reception" is able to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even remembers what kind of clothes they wear - and also hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those present based on the conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company talking to her, nor is it an employee of the company.
He asks if he came to visit someone and assures him that he will come to his aid soon.
All without the blue big screen.
It's amazing.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as the development of a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many people rumoured that Microsoft was changing strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax was invented, given that Microsoft has so far attached additional features and extras to Windows in all new versions.
The change of direction pays off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly being pushed into the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google took the first step to be a competitor to Windows.
Many people rightly realized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is an essential element for the dialogue of hardware and software.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to take into account the "death" of the operating system, not in absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this thought.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more about the web browser.
Turn on your computer just to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome -- and there's more time to browse than we spend in the window world.
What is the majority of the applications that come with the system for?
Fewer is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less than that of the Vista.
Less difficult, less overloaded, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services more on-line and to eventually provide an alternative to Google.
They really need all of this, I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo in Redmond at the beginning of the month in a lounge for Microsoft employees.
On the soda machine, a poster calls them to use the company’s browser. - "Your browser. It is our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
Last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, but rather in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, mobile phones are increasingly acting as computers.
But the delay, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely spoil their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, as well as one of the basic dresses of the well-kept gay customer.
And speaking of the list of specialties, we can recall the peace figure of the heavy-lifting heavylifting of the travelling circus with aka mustache.
But what are we talking about? It is nothing more than the men's cotton thighs, which are typically narrow and sleeveless.
That is, from the "tank", as the English-speakers call it, but none of the rivals of Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is referred to as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to the sport, because according to legend, Marcel Cerdan got his name from the boxer, Edith Piaf's lover.
Marcel’s excellent cotton material, unisex tailoring, his unique emblem and the small (recognizable) Belgian flag also stand out from his competitors. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn’t just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere carnivals, woolen trousers, sailors' T-shirts, baby clothes, mini-squeries - and so on - are all among the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
It is also unfortunate that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
Secondly Selling Record at Honda
In November, Honda will begin the second generation of Jazz.
It is true that the interior of its predecessor was already large enough, but the interior design of the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second-generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to his predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new body, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but in other markets it breaks sales records.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly one million pieces of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, with the new Jazz, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 the target of 100,000 cars was sold, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazzs in the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with 2,000 copies sold in the course of a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda’s traffic in Spain.
Representatives of the company predicted 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, rising to 1.8% last year, compared to 1.6%.
By 2010, they would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes to do so by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid – 4370 mm long – of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, the United States would account for 50% of the market distribution of Insight, while the rest would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight is due after the official demonstration in Valencia in January, in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every respect.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
Height, on the other hand, remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the interior has also become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new bodywork on the one hand, and the fuel tank in the middle on the other, which can be known from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the total cargo area of the so-called double floor trunk has increased, currently it is 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the above-mentioned dimensions for the 1.4-engine type, the 1.2 Honda Jazz has a boot capacity of 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be found, such as rear led lights or a panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors in the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the 67-degree opening angle of the front Jazz.
The second generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model is available with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the fuel consumption of both engines is more favourable than its previous model and has less CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2-litre engine delivers 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm 4900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and has an average of 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"I want to be a young mother; no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Currently, Cruz’s sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and pretty girls add her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the awarding of the most prestigious fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
It emanates from it, warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We're presenting Mango's new autumn-winter collection, which was designed with my brother Peneope. In addition, we will take part in the announcement of the second competition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we took over a lot of things.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch women, how they dress, how they change and sort their clothes - one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. You're a versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so too, but in the end these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in the clothes when I was a little, I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s house and go to my aunt’s wardrobe.
Well, that was the Canaan itself, it was almost a fun park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to invent our own style for classes and rehearsals to have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and with all due respect to designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday. You didn't fall into lethargy?
Oh, no, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it by this time, they're already experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock is not worrying.
I've been doing what I've been in the mood for a child, and it's been a great inner happiness.
And you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'll be a mother, because I was born to this as a woman, and I would even like to be a young mother, I definitely don't want to miss that.
As for the future father, it doesn’t matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let’s talk a few words about the movie. Last year, you made several movies that weren't even shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait to get out.
I, who started in the theatre, is very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I look forward to presenting the Last Hour and the search for Christ's tomb.
I wonder what you're saying to them...
As far as I know, you made your debut on the runway a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true...
I didn't go up to the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for the benefit of her own, Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes were auctioned off and the proceeds were donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't even know how kind of Naomi are.
They talk so much about him, so I know him, and I can assure you that half of them are not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'll do that, too.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I don’t know the impossible.
The collision-avoidant "bee car"
This time, Nissan drew inspiration from nature, the world of bees, to the development of accident-preventive technologies.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that avoids accidents mimic the bee flight.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing collision-preventive technologies.
The Nissan Motor Co. Engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of the renowned Tokyo University, in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the renowned University of Tokyo, built this little robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of the Technology Public Relations and Research and Development Brand, is defined as the BR23C as an additional extension of Nissan’s four-level safety guard cover.
The robot makes the company’s ability to avoid collision.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety guard cover.
More importantly, the role of the uterus is more important in the complex eye of the uterus, with which you see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees. Consequently, the uterus can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To replicate the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called laser rangefinder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision in front of the BR23C within a distance of up to 2 meters, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid a collision.
“As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot, immeiting the movement of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid a collision.
What distinguishes the system from the currently available instruments is that in this case the bypass maneuver is completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer for the project.
Unlike bees, the detour can not be directed up or downwards, nor diagonally, moving only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the swirling of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and manner, as in the case of bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot in addition to accelerating and deceleration to avoid collisions.
“This device has to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need to store data, nor intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabytes, but we don't even talk about megabyte memories.
This is the first step in developing an instant collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates to enter production cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the combination of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could provide further application to the end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Retired drunk drivers will be forced to install the "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving offences, the Ministry of Interior would force the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting the vehicle if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the State Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the purpose of the project is to restore traffic, the driver will also have to take part in a repeating course on transport education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Car Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75 percent of motorists who have been arrested for drunk driving are back in the car again.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air blown into it. If it is greater than the permissible, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than 1000 euros would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 study in the U.S. found that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on violations for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce it, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment to the Fundamental Law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party to include the system in school buses, as a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
The Spanish Air Force’s Carriage Party in Asturias, the Carriary Air Force of Asturias landed at 5:40 a.m. at the time announced in the program, at 5:40 a.m., the Spanish Air Force’s Duchy’s Actors’ Party carrying force.
The sun was already on its way, but it was still so hard that we could only use our hands as blinders to see the royal couple who came out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princess was coming to the city for an official visit to the city.
- Great, there's no airport transfer for a while... She's from here or something like...
- No, no, sir, the lady's Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or that...
But the Mexican press, and then he knows everything about the Duchess of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many people are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon formed by the 27 seafarers, who protect the dignity.
The Prince appears smiling, in a sea-blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, gets caught in the wind, in restrained attire, but not in the usual shoes flashing the toes - they may have warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They stop and smile for a moment for the cameras, then enter the room, where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel, one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are awaited by a chatter of the glossary of Mexican television.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of incumbent cash, doesn’t even lack common sense.
Because the crisis is on their hands and the Americans don’t entangle the maze of mortgage banks with questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative online game called “Bad Credit Hotel.”
This is the "Bad Loan Hotel"... that is, the Gogalibas.
The appearance of accommodation, and especially the receptionist’s sadness, suggests whether the time for borrowing has come once, twice, or even three times.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because that is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but less detailed.
It's more for adolescents than to the general public.
But what would happen if we complemented the game?
For example, the hotel would show our dream room.
In fact, it is something, because we dare not dream of buying a home...
The most valuable fashion award
The best place in the world for the awarding of a fashion prize is undoubtedly Paris, and among today’s fashion designers, the most sophisticated and the coolest of the fashion designers are undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to introduce the young talents of the fashion industry internationally.
The prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first tender, saw her own design clothes in the Mango window at the boulevard Haussmann in Paris at 54, but she almost shed tears away from her emotion.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest business in Europe and has recently opened on 1,335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
In the midst of the many events, as well as the thanks to Valentino – for the chairing of the jury – we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the most enjoyable Chagals, the presidential table of the gala dinner made by Mango showed even more spectacularly.
Nati, who, because of the recent death of his brother, came with a heavy heart and sadness, bore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking adorns of the ELAH. He and his son Luis, nearly two meters high, accompanied Valentin to the main table of dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango entertained the guests. Along with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they were left without a suit, as they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own trousers and shirts, and at dinner he was wearing a sexy long black dress. During the night’s opera visit, she became so ensnared with the love of Gaya Toledo in the ballet room, recalling the old days, she immersed herself at one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not take part in the palace visit, but before that he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we could admire Oliver Martinez - he is almost two meters high and he rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he told me well that he did not want any scents in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l' l', c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
Not 1000, but 1000, and one way to turn off the chaotic and troubled everyday life.
Another good news is that you can find them all in a single book that arrives in bookstores on September 30 to bring peace of mind.
It’s almost excruciating at 7:00 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about what accelerated life today’s world is forced to live every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is the common disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and bridging problems at work.
No, that number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of possibilities in her book, so that everyone can find the solution that is best suited and adapted to her free moments.
The stress-relieving work is titled 1001 Relaxation Method, and the tranquility emanating from it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress from the world of work or personal relationships can hardly be eliminated, this manual will certainly shake you in your faith.
What’s more, it also offers other ideas that all help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and become a central problem in your stress life, it’s time to sit back in the armchair, relax and focus only on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who speak while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
Quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've told some of them he was talking at night.
It can be completely rhapsodic (for example, it occurs only once with a high fever) or more regular (daily, weekly or once a month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
It is often coupled with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime urination, and evening urination (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal either.
As already mentioned, it can be a high-flying condition, or even a stressful situation or an increased agitation.
So far, little has been studied.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, it can consist of incoherent words, murmurs, but, unlike all this, it may also occur in the form of shouting, crying or speaking for a longer period.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and to consult a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and can offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, and consequently there is no cure for it, unless the sleep disorder is associated with some other manageable form (such as insomnia or stressful situation).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a set of preventive measures:
Be careful that the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose reassuring games and avoid watching your child’s fear-mongering or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or have a harder time relaxing will be taught to find some relaxation methods to find inner calm.
This helps the child to sleep more peacefully.
If you do start talking during your sleep, try to keep your peace.
Remember, it is harmless to the child, and they won’t remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child up.
It would be superfluous because the child is unconscious, but he would get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety several times, it is advisable to consult a specialist or to reveal what causes the child to have a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarer case), do not start asking them to know anything.
It would be superfluous, because during sleep it is not so conscious to collect your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what we hear and with possible conclusions.
Never tell your child to question her secrets at night.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it is only a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern finally on the straight
After a long run, the Illhaeusern team finally gained new momentum and won again at home.
Although there was no fantastic match, the yellow-blacks were in position several times, of which they could eventually gain.
The pace of the match was not very tight, as the attackers felt it was difficult for them to feel the right rhythm.
The first goal was attempted by the captain of the visiting team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball barely touched the upper corner of the goalpost. Then Illhaeusern got the upper hand and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a long shot, then Hirn’s shot flew over the goal. Romain spiked, and Diebold also tried to shake Dannemarie's defenses with a distant experiment.
On the other side, the players defended in a block in the midfield, and only the perpetual Riahi got into a shooting position.
The start of the second half was decisive: Riahi and Temporale were first in position with Dannemarie. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: Diebold’s first shot was scored by the illhaeuserni Marais with an excellent position, then he put it into the goal (53rd minute).
However, the goal scorer of Illhausern could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the pitch, so his teammates had to continue the fight with a human handicap.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds had some excitement when, after a big rush, the ball got very close to the goalpost.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Briton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistere on Tuesday morning to meet with the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a “constructive spirit” and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would “approve with concrete proposals.”
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the “crisis committee”, which was set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of taking action against the rise in the price of gasoline, as the oil price exceeded the record average price of 1.14 euros per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the president, said: “We will discuss with fishermen about the solutions to help companies regain their competitiveness, and make it safer for seafarers to work conditions and wages.”
Fishermen are determined to arrive with Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowdown demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
They also paralyze Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle's down were not blocked.
Roadblocks were placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination. At dawn, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of the tank stores in the Brest ports, as demonstrations took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further demonstrations in other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. For example, in Sables d'Olonne in Vendée County, fishermen did not board a boat, while in Le Havre some 20 vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
La Turballe and Le Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique department, ended the blockade of the huge Total refinery in Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer’s fishermen decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting in the ministry by deciding on the next steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to decide on Tuesday on his next step and participation at the planned meeting at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike will continue,” because “fishermen do not give in to their demands and are “willing to travel to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents for a liter of liter, but they believe that the operation of a boat would only become profitable if the price of diesel fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Puppy" was killed in his Connecticut home at the age of 83 as a result of cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid their respects to Paul Newman, a cinema legend who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its 2008 shipping plans
Despite the threat of the global economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is expected to keep plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is highly counted on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has shipped a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which has recovered by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the prepaid 85 billion dollars, according to a Dominican release by the Financial Times.
In addition to his international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would divest most of almost all other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of the sale.
The AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company’s International Lease Financial Corp., the 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings’ reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on the sale.
The AIG must quickly obtain liquid assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollar loan approved by the U.S. government. This assumes the risk of having to divest up to 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique study on the Morning Meeting’s historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (an unprecedented decline of nearly 800 points) and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.
The Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technology papers, closed at 1,983.73 points with a decline of 199.61 points, while the Standard & Am 500’s expanded index fell by 9.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weak at the time of the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan aimed at restoring the market balance, it began to deteriorate.
MEPs rejected the funds requested by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with 228 "no" votes 205 against "yes".
The plan was rejected by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
“From this market has filtered bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market expected this plan,” he added, expressing his concern that if a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be “too late”.
“If the plan is really doomed, then the Fed (US Central Bank) And it will be the turn of the other central banks to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will be tightened,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further aggravate the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “every day has passed, more and more financial institutions are going bankrupt” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities ensured that Wachovia’s banking businesses were acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market “is not only an American, but a global crisis has developed,” adds the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has become significantly intensified.
The 10-year government bond yield decreased from 3.82% on Friday evening to 3.632%, while the 30-year government bond declined from 4.357% to 4.161% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay USD 9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley’s share price fell sharply on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of 25.25 dollars, or a total of USD 3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% lower than the book value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide a return of 10% and a conversion price of USD 31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of .29 dollars, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s share price fell by 6.79% at around 5 p.m. in Greenwich, closing at 23.07 dollars.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bankholding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which would diversify its activities, but is under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the company giants listed on Wall Street.
According to the terms announced on Monday, the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about 8.5 billion dollars.
“A week ago, we thought that the stake would consist entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director in Tokyo.
“However, because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and prevent potential risks.”
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share decreases by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares in a year, provided that the trading price of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period of time, i.e. to increase to approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can use MUFG to leverage investment opportunities, improve their balance sheets and increase their liquid resources.
However, a spokesman for the group did not want to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG’s partnership, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved “determinally” since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a major ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Only one of the major investing banks remained “survivors” following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had received 15 billion dollars, some of which came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
The re-establishment of the republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint plan for Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.
Following a sample of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa expressed his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He succeeded in fulfilling his mission, as 64% of voters voted in favour of the referendum, according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted against, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast in the open.
50% + 1 vote was needed to adopt the draft constitution.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the exit of the ballot-office and the census of an NGO both proved the huge advantage of the “yes” votes with a ratio of 63% and 70%, respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday.
“The constitution has won an overwhelming victory,” he said, thanking the Ecuadorians at his governor’s seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) monitoring mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444 point text summarizing the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, and the state maintains the right to “planning development” for a country that basically lives on oil production by foreign companies and the currency sent by emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will again compete for the mandate of the head of state in February 2009.
The constitution also included the gratuitousness of health services and education. The president has already begun to introduce this in his country, which has a population of 13.9 million, and half of the population lives below the subsistence level.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country. This could put an end to Quito and Washington’s agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility, which is the base of US anti-drug measures.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign officials claimed the victory in a televised duel by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain’s actions were respectable, he did not prove to be “irreager enough” to stop his popularity: this is evidenced by surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%, respectively).
Of the most important, still indecisive voters, 39% of the respondents believe Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden’s great performance on Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton said: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts.”
McCain, in his seventies, never fails to prioritize his own, indisputably vast foreign policy experience. In addition, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand,” the attack said on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge he needs to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that is being exploited by Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not let himself be embarrassed: he was put together and exactly.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama does,” said the Democratic ad broadcast over the weekend, retorting the Republican leader for refusing to see the impact of the crisis on the American “People of the Street.”
“In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the pouring rain in North Carolina for the meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers" on his lips. The turbulent situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider to be the most suitable for saving the economy on the verge of collapse.
“Next week may be a turning point,” said Charles Schumer, the influential Democrat senator.
Ramum Emanuel, a Clinton government veteran, said Obama “has such excellent instincts in the economy as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the Democratic presidential candidate’s eyes, the current crisis is “the final verdict over eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite fluctuations in the stock market, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the creation of a possible energy independence of the country through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously avoided issues related to the 700 billion dollar bailout plan (EUR 470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Have you noticed that there was a choice here?"
Young people and opposition protested in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closing of the polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although no results have yet been released, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko, saying, "Mr. Die, give it up."
Some people admit that they didn’t even go to vote: “Why would I have gone for?” They can do whatever they want with my vote,” says a young man.
The demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself look good in front of foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were to be considered clean by the observers, they could lift the sanctions imposed on the country, which denied 40 Belarusian leaders and froze some bank accounts.
However, the opposition said the elections were not clear.
“We were afraid of electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting of votes,” said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesman for the coalition of the Twelve parties and said in a statement.
“The changes were only nominal,” said Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. “The point is who counts the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition get into parliament, it means that they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament will allow them to be included in television, to sit in the regions of the country, and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because “the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated”.
Because if our heavily indebted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk falling under Russia’s jurisdiction.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will take effect on the outcome of the vote to be valid.
They stress that the turnout seems to be too high, and the wide-ranging organisation of the preliminary voting (which 26% of the voters took part in Minsk) gave the opportunity to manipulate any kind.
“Have you noticed that elections were held here?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, who was released from prison in August this year, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
A maximum of five opposition MPs will be elected to the parliament, namely those who are best suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night is again overturned on October Square.
President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission will be happy on television.
19 hostages freed in Chad
A Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers, who took 11 tourists and eight of their escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unscathed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were rescued by an Egyptian commando in Chad during the morning.
In good condition, around 3:30 p.m., they arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo’s international airport.
The hostages were banned from speaking to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and the kidnappers “not paid ransom,” Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat on 19 September on the border between Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in off-road safari. The group was then deported from one hiding place by the 35 unidentified hostage-takers to another.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptian guides: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and director of the safari-organizing Aegyptous travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived at the scene in two helicopters, where they raided the hostage-takers just before dawn.
“There was a firefight between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the leader, who asked not to be named.
He also said that a total of 150 special squadrons were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were complemented by German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and their action groups,” he said, without further details.
He also denied that the hostages had been paid a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that an SUV was intercepted while patrolling the kidnappers. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader), and two were arrested.
The military said the hostage-takers were in contact with a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
The news and the ongoing election campaign are currently focused on the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will raise his voice to highlight the ridiculous sums of these small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical monuments on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or in Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American Neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, every elected representative and every government agency.
Within the framework of the Association of Historical Sociétés d'histoire du Québec of 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy, more than 40,000 volunteers are working on the research of history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with minimal budget.
Often these organizations protect our tooth and nail heritage, and with the last power of the drowning man, they protest when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up to protect historical and cultural heritage?
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday. Dr. Dr. President Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world.
Most importantly, it managed to regain the trust of the people, which seriously shattered by the 1980s and 1990s’ Incredible Blood-related scandal.
As it is known, the blood supply service of the Canadian Red Cross was treated by the national blood supply reserve of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, the government of Canada, in February 1994, under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, launched an official investigation. The purpose of this was to shed light on the circumstances led to the tragedy and to make suggestions to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed the submission of his report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee held this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports led to the creation of two blood supply services in Canada: the Hema-Québec serving Quebec, and the other is the other of the other provinces and the Canadian Blood Transfusion Company responsible for the supply of the two territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
“In the years that followed, we have regained people’s trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field.” Décary is proud to announce that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population considered the Héma-Québece to be reliable.
However, Dr. Decary does not forget that “trust is an extremely fragile thing”.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, the Hema-Québec has used the principle of prudence.
During this period, a number of cases have been revealed in Europe where a new variant of mad cow disease, i.e. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has also infected people, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
“We had no idea whether this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. Accordingly, if we are unsure and there is a risk of developing a serious illness, we must use exclusion measures. In this case, it was a Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that causes brain changes, so it inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, it was clear that the disease was spread through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of prudence.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows the HIV virus to be more sensitively diagnosed. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, not antibodies against the virus, on which the previously used tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical devices, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to a period of less than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk that blood donors were unknowingly infecting blood and not detecting it.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“Other things put, that means we should allocate 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 4000,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
“I think anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions in order to restore health,” says the chief executive of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what kind of new pathogens will enter the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on our guard,” Dr. Décary continued, stressing that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“With the ageing of the population, the demand is increasing.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood donors, as the number of people in the network for blood donation accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, all healthy people, at least 18 years old, who meet the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example. Those who have been to a country where malaria is destroying is not entitled to blood donation for a year.
“With this, we have the 3% of the reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare to run out of stocks.
However, we have to increase the number of blood donors as much as the existing ones get older, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
But it is very difficult for people to be persuaded to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In this fast-paced world today, you barely have a single hour to go to give blood,” says Francine Décary.
The Hema-Québec, who has an annual budget of USD 297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeball tissues and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then placed at the Hema-Québec, which also treats Quebec’s only public stem cell bank.
The umbilical cord, which was once treated as medical waste, can extract blood that is rich in stem cells, allowing for the treatment of serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that the thousandth umbilical cord blood sample was added to our bank, and we plan to remove more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants,” said Dr. Décary, who believes that the umbilical cord blood removal program is very popular nowadays.
“Many moms are sad that you don’t have the chance to do so,” really is the case, because Héma-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - In the semi-finals of Impact
Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounders 3:1 in the USL-1 qualifiers and reached the semifinals with a total of 4:3. This was the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals, which took place at the Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro midfielder in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second half the Montreal team’s two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also hit the opponent’s net.
Roger Levesque was the only player to play Matt Jordan from the Sounders.
Recall that in Friday's first game, Impact lost 2:1 to Starfire Complex in Tukwail, Seattle.
Impact will play Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who lost 3:1 to the Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps reached the semi-finals with a 5:4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triathlete is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and the Canadiens won 3:2 against the Florida Panthers last night from penalty shots at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the match with two assists and Kovalev with one assist, which was the fourth win of the team’s six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian player warns.
"I need another game to feel really in shape."
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he was happy with the result of the game.
He had a huge ovation.”
The Northern Aspirations of Charest
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's meeting ended, Jean Charest traveled yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is aiming to win in the by-election to be held today.
“Repressing our last great northern border”: this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Chares at yesterday’s meeting of the Liberal Party in Quebec’s Liberal Party. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but the president tried to focus on the essentials.
During his presentation, behind his back, images similar to "Moulin images" were projected.
On the three giant projectors, impressive images followed each other: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used in election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very close.
The “Northenth Plan” is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister’s “vision” on the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a “new economic area”. This includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Lately, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area that starts at the 49th latitude) has often been presented in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
However, the head of state merely confined himself to explaining why he considered the North to be a “patler of great potential”. However, he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, nor a specific prioritisation for future projects.
He highlighted only a few opportunities for development: mainly hydroelectric power plants, the forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further exacerbated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
Located in the north, "niscal, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds"," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice as big as France", "our territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us,” the head of state repeated, stressing that he wants to create a national founding myth.
He emphasized that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Quebec design work, the James Bay...
“This is ours, our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break, inspecting the huge map behind him.
The North, which is located on 70% of the territory of Quebec, also includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
“This is our historic statement, which has been confirmed by all governments.
“There is a line of boundaries on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity for it, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “we must rethink our perspective on the North in the light of climate change”, the Prime Minister said, referring to the North-West passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of polar ice.
In the Prime Minister’s opinion, occupying the area in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
And what about the indigenous peoples of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec will pay special attention to them, and the plan will benefit many of them, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter being the delegate of the Parti Québécois ungavai) had already begun negotiations with about thirty local community members.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee headed by Benot Pelletier has also begun, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit”, where “they create a common vision”.
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systemised and environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Chares described this "vision" as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which is 50th for the election of Jean Lesage party president. It started on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating its anniversary.
One of the decisions adopted recommends that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout dam.
“Politaries of our party, including the founder of Hydro-Québecet Godbout, Lesage, who carried out the quiet revolution and the nationwide proliferation of hydropowers, or Bourassa, the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another, though conservative work, John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of 1957 and 1963, "Roads to the North".
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam plan, President Charest said the commission was planned for 2012.
“It’s between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his supporters, and his statement was greeted with a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which is also allowed by the law.
However, he emphasized that his calendar is already full, as he took on tasks at the Federal Council’s meeting in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to formulate nationalist resolutions, which were almost without hesitation. This is mainly about “constitutional aspirations”: the liberal party in particular demands the recognition of the “specific character of the Quebec” in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have the right to veto decisions in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, reiterated the development policy in Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, refused to apply this policy.
“If they had not, “we would have gone much further now,” said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Francoise Mercure, who was nominated as a candidate in the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s adoption of the Northern Plan.
“However, we want this not to be a mere charade,” said Sébastien Proulx, party leader, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Vic Toews, Harper Cabinet Minister (by the way, “the minister of justice”) last summer took the liberty of calling Louise Arbour Canada’s “shame.”
This is how to defame a woman who has fought for justice and deserves all our admiration – it says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, who, among the Western countries concerned, has not transported his own nationals from the Guantanamo Bay Concentration Camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of committing the crimes he was accused of.
It is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and will allow a child soldier to suffer inhumane conditions.
The only government to make a puppet theatre in the judiciary while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers’ Association are demanding the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to be able to receive a fair trial in Canada.
Our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it does not matter to him that a young adult has already been spiritually destroyed, and many years of torture probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, our rights, freedom and democracy are currently undersling intoxication. "Democracy": Harper constantly voices this word, which from his mouth sounds merely an empty speech.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the discretion of the leader of a government that has been in the minority (and what else after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies the Virtue, the Law, and the Order. They do not see that this government tramples the values that our country owed its reputation and dignity to.
Dear Mr Toews, shame is more like this - not to look elsewhere.
The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, deputy CEO of the mine Barrick Gold of Canada.
Following Orwelli’s exposition, Garver states that the world’s largest gold-producing company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation lawsuits, is made not on the basis of the truth, but by law.
It's no surprise that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to do public debate would be to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Irrespective of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend significant amounts of money on defense and combat in an unequal struggle where on the other hand is an army of lawyers backed by almost inexhaustible sources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, the tactics of destroying the defendant and making a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposite, but also intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in public opinion.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada, the parties that are disputing usually do not hit each other with a stick, but tell their thoughts.
Therefore, it would have been enough for the mine to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust public opinion, and one move will sweep aside the petitions and letters written to the authors of Noir Canada.
Can Mr Garver explain to you how to initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, disregards the opinion of this public?
In the head of the vice-president, this word probably means only lawyers who have paid me generously, not Canada’s total population: the meaning of the term is thus greatly narrow.
In a democratic state, even those who defame others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand – or does not want to understand – that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the rough procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, not by a lawsuit aimed at silencing many. (In the context of the term "public debate," Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using that term.)
In addition to Garver’s surreal statements, Barrick Gold’s process poses an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for justice, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
The procedure, taken as a whole, denies the right to quote credible sources, and the right to debate facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If a country like Canada can only be studied and discuss topics under the burden of litigation that you do not like the rich companies of today’s world, then who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to answer.
We have been able to deal with debates, differences and conflict in our university for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s ill-considered procedure shows that, contrary to its claim, it did not want to have an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada. It is time for governments to finally implement measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans agree
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Congress finally reached an agreement on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The plan, worth 700 billion US dollars, to curb the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Substantive points of the plan: more effective control of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the state funds allocated; new provisions to maintain the number of houses seized due to non-payment; the right of access to the salaries of the managers of companies benefiting from the salaries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, Republican MP who was in the trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We have made a big step forward towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush administration.
“We did everything with the aim of saving the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis that hit Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do that, there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday life of Americans,” said Republican Congressman Judd Gregg.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investors’ mood.
They gave themselves a deadline for the agreement until the opening of the stock market this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late were ready to reach an agreement, but they were not happy that the situation had increased to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the expansion of the agreement with elements such as the provisions on the preservation of house ownership or the salaries of the leaders of companies that have been helped by the state.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps to take some extraordinary action because of other people’s irresponsibility, it’s not a welcome thing.
These steps are necessary,” he said in an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, “I want to know the details, but I hope they do.”
“What I have read broadly, it can be seen that it is something that we all need to digest and by which we can move forward.
“The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the 700-billion-dollar plan, taxpayers’ money would be used to buy the dubious claims of American financial institutions, and some risky, unsellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of the real estate bubble. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft deal was overthrown by a group of Republican MPs last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain “poisoning” assets of companies in difficulty will only be provided by the government rather than acquiring them.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, the plan also included a provision that requires that if the government has to bear the losses under the program for five years, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a instalment of USD 250 billion would be paid first, followed by an additional USD 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of the remaining 350 billion dollars should be approved by Congress with another vote.
In exchange for the assistance, Washington acquires a stake in the supported companies, through which he receives dividends from the profits and can sell after the crisis has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate that will cover mortgages involved in the plan. It may also set maximum wages and severance payments to managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, the statements against the plan were repeated again among both Republicans and Democrats.
“It’s clear that Washington won’t hear your voice,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the leader of the small congressional group called the “skeptic faction,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four of great economic experts, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to ask Congress not to hurry and to thoroughly examine which path you will choose,” Sherman said.
At the same moment, they realized again in Europe that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group in the amount of 11.2 billion euros (14.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor on the verge of bankruptcy after it lost 2 million euros (USD 2.9 billion) due to the crisis in subprime mortgages in the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the top 20 European banks and the top ten insurance companies.
“This is not a waste of money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be insecure.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be planning to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total amount of the ongoing loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to 41 billion pounds (USD 75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they will acquire the British bank’s subsidiaries and customers.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor's Ball
Beautiful Azures' eyes, according to some, are his main trump card, others say he was his main weakness.
Has the American actor with a charming smile ever got rid of his dynasty mirror?
Yeah, and I don't.
Due to his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, the loud style, which is the essence of the real great monsters of the art world, was also far from him.
But what a huge track he's had!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 at his Connecticut estate on Friday. He was one of the last icons of the heyday of American cinema.
He was less monumental personality than Brando, whom he looked like, and who for a long time was a competitor on the screen. In his roles, he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixture of blood often comes from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian descent.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure in the American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his merits.
After all, he embodies a country that is a fan of the ideal of the "self-made man" and the warrior's dream that was broken in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at Actor's Studio in New York before he burst into the world of theater, television, and soon later on.
In addition to being at the forefront of civil rights, he also won second place as a racing driver in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what kind of downsides were the life of this mysterious, aloof, dedicated to his work, who hated the glitter of show business. This will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his big roles, he can only be seen on the black screen of memories.
Reviewing his oeuvre, the seventh American art passed through to us, the cinema has been dotted with constant changes for more than fifty years.
In our memory, the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) is mixed up in the Tennessee Williams adaptation "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990) the sensitive mr. In the form of Bridge, we can remember him, who is faced with his old age, that his marriage did not live up to his hopes.
Paul Newman has also seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Upstairs", he gave an unforgettable performance in the role of the stormy criminal-kicking Rocky Graziano. This role originally intended for James Dean, which was taken over after its death, started Newman’s acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant film "The Great Thing", which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.
Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961) played a bitter, vengeful billiard player and returned in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money". He won his only Oscar in 1987 from nine nominations.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by the change of eras.
Younger ones are best known for George Roy Hill's cult film "Jecons" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an ice hockey team working with methods, using methods.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Leap" in 1994.
Sam Mendes's "The Way of Damnation" ended in 2003, which was the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, its fainting and hypotheism.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier did not look at the “living refutation of underplay” without humour: he thought his play was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, whose long time the film roles fell on his lap.
Yet he played less often young and successful characters: he preferred to play figures on the margins of society – neurotic, alcoholic, male, or hopeless – figures whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a truly modest and sensitive man in his heart.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted by the Canadian author Margaret Laurence's novel), Joanne Woodward, starred a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and Son", which was made in 1984, commemorates his son Scott, who died of drugs, in a drug overdose.
Yesterday, many admirers of Newman remembered the actor. His close friend and old comrade Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Decidence" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"), said with grief: "His presence made life and the world better.
Egoty and joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking and his remarks criticizing Hollywood’s debauchery are obscured.
We have often seen his picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in the mouth, although at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to the foundation for children with the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for the star of fortune.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen, above all.
What did they produce at Zuschlag & Tsai’s account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, which are particularly damaging to a criminal organisation and on a commercial basis.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the tender funds won were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified with untrue invoices.
State and municipal funds – in total HUF 65 million – migrated partly to the cash register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of certain persons.
The method presented by the investigating authority was that the tender funds won were taken up on the basis of cost invoices, behind which there was no real performance, and the associations never fulfilled the agreed obligation.
According to the indictment, most of the accounts were false.
For these, the invoice blocks were purchased in the market of Józsefváros, and the round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And to which companies the account production should take place, among others, it was decided on the Balaton-felvidéki boulevard to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the testimony of the latter, it had to look like pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, and modelled on which invoices were drawn up for applications to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of them were written by István Lados with his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports necessary to win the subsidies.
One of Lados's "study trips" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, dated in 2003, the restaurant provided the meals of the ninety-member group of the Sure Pont Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the account issued to the Foundation for a Better Future - later for the Third Millennium - was full of formal and content errors issued in the summer of 2002.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, more than ten people could not fall asleep in it one night, but the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form-fillers also overdid when they marked the Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounting – according to the information given to the prosecution – did not even include documents for the Better Future and Hoppá.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called in to the prosecutor’s office and presented invoices to him, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The stamp had the wrong name of our business and our tax number."
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, it was also not correct that, according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, as they have a total of eleven rooms, in which there are not so many places.
In addition, the bill was also for catering, while their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The zealous account makers did not investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked like only organizes foreign trips, so they stumbledly marked travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not in line with the company’s account-issuing practices.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, the document also included VAT, although the transport activities directed to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the VAT rate was also a mistake in Hotel Révfülöp Kft. on the four documents issued by the Better Future, as the company’s service is not subject to 25 percent VAT, but 15 percent VAT, and the hotel’s employees only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the “exhibitors” broke the account by indicating that in the case of a company, road freight transport was designated as an activity carried out, according to the prosecutor’s procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, it was also due to formal differences – an incorrect bill format, not a real stamp – that the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st century. The accounts for the Cultural Association of the Century and the Secure Point are fake.
As in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices were issued by them.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention, for example, that the HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Association for the Young City was eating there, so the liquidator of the company – as far as we know – denied that he had issued the paper.
I was consciously exhibited
Another group of account issuers are those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Foundation for Opportunity for Budapest issued an invoice to the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation at the request of the Young Left – Young Socialists for the Together Third Millennium, for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded the head of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious invoice.
The Biogate Ltd., which is currently in liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Vöröspine Association with invoices issued for roughly five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither is it a movement of money, because the invoices were refurbished after that, but the organizations have already forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice belong to those that are related to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which deals with the fuel and vehicle trade in Budapest, although not found there, was Iván Kubatov.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT equipment, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices are issued on 14 September 2005. It has been purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since then.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man, who would also have been forwarded to the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued an invoice on behalf of the Ltd. to Atlas, Hoppa and Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, and that he had taken their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of the companies worked, which, according to the defendant, was due to the fact that they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited, because at the request of Zsolt Szente, lawyer who also made the papers of company foundations, he issued invoices to the associations connected to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generation, on behalf of the companies.
Kubatov gave 15 invoices to the organizations on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
According to the prosecutor’s office, 10 percent of the amounts indicated in the invoices and the VAT hit Kubatov’s hands.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the competition of the Secure Point.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted a tender for the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the socialist party.
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, the five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as he did at the prosecutor’s office, is likely to report on the process of the production of invoices.
It may be most interesting if the first defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to lift everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak all the time, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the interest of this, or whether the socialists made a deal with him in exchange for the reimbursement of the majority of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
Who, by the way, may have been offended by today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. for his house arrest, have constantly fallen on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not reimburse them are free to walk, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, he has no opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overbiding: why do we give out more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money and overestitimate the goods.
This known and seemingly irrational behavior has been able to explore the neurological-economic foundations of neurologist and economic researchers at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose out in a type of competition, such as eBay’s auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research was trying to map this "play" neurological scheme using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took the lottery, the other group participated in a player auction, while using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method, they examined the active brain areas of the subjects.
Participants could win money in both games, but during the auction game, in which the overbiding of the other party is an essential element, the complex under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, became intensively activated when the game is lost.
This brain area, among many other functions, plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, the economic members of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In it, three groups bid against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were winning the game, they would receive 15 dollars in money as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, was paid just 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group lost the money in the event of a losing auction.
So the difference between the two groups was just that for one of them the win, and for the other the loss.
However, by proving the neurologist hypothesis, the members of the team playing against "loss" were willing to bets even higher than the control and "wins" group.
“These results cannot be derived from any existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena at the auction with the joy of victory and the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now obtaining a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we go to the doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, the leading cause of death is the case with chronic liver disease.
The number of people with hepatitis in Hungary is estimated at 100,000, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The term hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver prerogatives caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have a lot of similarities, hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
The hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (intrade, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should be vaccinated against the A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After that, the jaundice can be seen on the skin and the white eye, the feces are light, the urine becomes dark, the healing can take up to two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die from a more severe type of disease, hepatitis B--derived liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people is infected with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the cells of the liver insidiously, in many cases the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent early prevention and regular screening tests.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases: people who had been through blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth to consult the family doctor when any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
Recognising the disease can be cured in time, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so that the infectivity can be eliminated and the development of cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was held for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries help with partial nationalization on the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortison, who is in trouble as the first European, due to the spill-over effect of the US credit market crisis: the three countries support the money and insurance institution, which also has a total of 11.2 billion euros, which also has Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments consulted at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank has the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been raging in the waves for more than a year, so decisions on the bank can therefore be classified as a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, nearly half (49%) of all three states will acquire the bank’s property there.
The bank is likely to sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year, mainly insurers.
Fortis’s shares began to fall sharply last week, with serious crisis phenomena at the institute in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that with an employee of 85,000 people, the bank is too big enough to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s papers fell by about 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the group’s total market capitalisation is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s managers, this is not realistic.
The management blamed the overseas market uncertainties regarding the adoption of the USD 700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were up slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed as Filip Dierckx.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has applied for a substantive offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry and lose their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank’s clients, the branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has a standalone branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does anyone who believe in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious belief acts as a kind of painkiller, which may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects people’s perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the framework of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and the same number of atheists were given electroshocks, while they all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that were responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university also participate.
The study was conducted precisely by attaching a sparkling device to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look hard at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci’s painting Lady with the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a certain religious state among the faithful, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes while either looking at the religious or general picture.
Catholics reported that while the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt in "safety" as if they had "taken care" of him and "rested, filled them with peace".
While watching a religious-themed image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo’s work was seen in front of him.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any image with a strong impact, even in atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
“We should find a picture of whom they feel very positive about as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber show the image of the faithful, what would affect their pain control?
Would the sight of the world of the world of America be even better?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say that it can be found in people’s pockets as much as above their heads in the sky; he knows where they are on vacation, what kind of clinics they go to and what they are interested in.
And that's not enough, Eric Schmidt, one of the company's main people.
However, as for the skeptics who draw parallels with the Orwellian horror, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data from its users, which is necessary to adhere to the original goal of Google founders, which was “taken all the information in the world.”
According to the Google CEO, the company, even after ten years of worldwide work, is still at the beginning of the fact that they can handle all the information.
Asked what will happen in five years’ time, Schmidt said, “Do you want Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work really fits me?” – but until then, the software can’t answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that during the search searches on the Internet, the search words are accurately recorded, from what IP address they were looking for and which page they visited after the search.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing backstory, look back on what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and through which it will generate much more personalized results for them in the long run - based on the same logic, with which the system will offer us products and services based on our previously said and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? asks users who are concerned with Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company may be frightening, not by guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or rebellion against power in the Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the terms in search are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be handed over to third parties, in such cases the privacy rights of internet users are not protected by anything.
Perhaps the loudest example of this past was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information about pedophiles on the social side, which it maintains, to enable identification.
Internet users, who were concerned about privacy, on the other hand, could sigh in May, when the company, together with the EFF’s electronic rights organization, successfully proved its truth against the FBI: according to which Google cannot later be compelled to provide any point of the Constitution asking for anything to provide the secretly requested information from the FBI.
(However, the federal government successfully won some 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it won by referring to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users, as well as a list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
So it’s quite controversial to Google’s reputation: they’re scourging those who are afraid of providing their personal data because they feel their intimate sphere and privacy are being impaired by starting to use Google’s services and act against them with a rebellion for multi-companies shining in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wildlife, featuring enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries, see them as the next generation of big companies, the "good corporations," unlike their rivals, Microsoft, which is a world conquest for Windows, no matter how much they fight for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask for an identification code from its users, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly kept of source code and software package is much more accessible, younger and cooler than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also happen that the geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between privacy and the Internet, which was followed by web 2.0, one of the most frequently-spoken keywords of recent years.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving behind us and using the channels of communication available to us, and while the extent of these changes individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can lead to multiple social media sites from Facebook to Xanga, which can be linked to other services, such as Twitter, or lastfm listing his music habits, and then you can connect them to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also lead a blog that automatically displays their latest photo galleries, which are stored on the Flickr or Picas.
While you can read about a number of exemplary cases that reveal: the girlfriend can easily realize, seeing the morning flood of photos of the common circle of friends, that her cheating friend spent the evening with or who can fire a company employee just because she describes her sincere opinion about the top management in her blog: one is certain, the concept of privacy has been completely revalued by now.
Those who live an online life are from what they show of themselves, and with this we can formulate the basic principle behind the behaviour of today’s young people.
And if you want to hide something, or at least want to bypass the Google monopoly, you can do so (starting with Scroogle, who uses Google’s search system, but at the same time deliberately ignores a trace).
For example, there are not a few people who are deliberately registering on social media sites so that they cannot be found, and Google’s online applications can be replaced with alternative versions, from word processors to the image manager and newsreader, which are not tied to huge server parks and that do not compile the best profile that has existed so far.
Public opinion is not so secretly waiting for Google to show off its teeth.
The company is worth 156 billion dollars more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening advertising agencies’ revenues, and the increasingly acceleratingly cessation of services cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
Critical spectators, however, also find counterpoints that seem to be unsettling: for example, the top management completely rejected the employees’ protests, after doubling the price of the company kindergarten, the management found the employee’s catering arbitrary periodically expensive, but it is all dwarfed by the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006, and according to their agreement, the company filters out all the best results.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they don’t advertise a new service in advance, only when it can be used, but the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project is on the scale that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court, because others can be residing with our Health system, others can be resied about our health system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow’s short story, Scroogled, with orwellian overtones, describes the future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly from Google’s data.
Two juveniles helped the double killer of Ózd in the imprint
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of the double murder in Ózd, and according to the well-founded suspicion, they were assisting in the disappearance of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people acknowledged the act they were charged with aiding and are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two juveniles – according to MTI’s information, are defending themselves at large.
Complicity can be punished with up to five years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder in Ózd – a 23-year-old local man – was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of pre-explored, out of profit, for profit, for the crime of manslaughter committed on several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then the man’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was prepared in advance for the crime, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The gun and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the help of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague stock exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – some five billion Czech crowns – for the purchase of the 100 percent share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs as one of the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
Ninety-nine percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60 percent of the shares in a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the offer of the Poles is the highest amount, which has been offered so far for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.l. 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In Tuesday’s comments dedicated to an ever-deterifying international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already mention “second September 11”.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president, accuses the president of Rome’s La Repubblica, even unable to line up his own party behind a law that was wound up behind a law that was made in order to remedy the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, which was mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11, the second.
Some of the Madrid press see the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but the congressional vote is in danger of Washington not offering a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can provide a lifeline to the staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers’ money can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor any new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to outade their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the infirmary financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalled the Vienna Der Standard, which is increasingly realistic about the fact that, like Americans, European taxpayers have to go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which sweeps the old continent like a tsunami.
The “rescue” does not have to wave a hundred billion euros in a short time, but it would be good to record that in which case it is reasonable to use taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
The flight of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors in the natural world?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bioi-imitation car robotic control system, a robotic minicar that has been endowed with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of promoting the design of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, each bee forms its oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shield, Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and R&D director, explained at the exhibition.
It is important to play the role of the complex eye of the uterus, which can be seen in all directions in a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, the engineers used the idea of a laser telemeter.
In front of the BR23C, this identifies obstacles within a distance of two meters in a 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid a collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and the car robot, immeiting the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to avoid the impact.
Unlike any current system, this avoidable maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If that wasn’t the case, the car robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It must react in an exponently and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inseen layer of safety protection, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike the bees, the deviation should not be directed up, downwards or diagonally, only two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the swirability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility of avoiding other bees, only rotating motion and acceleration, as well as deceleration, were used as an option for the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means that they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, an instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store it.
This device has to process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No need for gigabytes of memory of the size of a megabyte.
This is the first step in developing an immediate evasion technology that Nissan estimates that will allow production cars to enter production cars within ten years.
Further application can be the assembly of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the driver to the specified end destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It also became the name of the expensive child.
A written version of the multi-scensing economic rescue package law to be applied in several instalments has been completed to seek the purchase of the bad loans of banks.
In the first round, half of the money is spent.
During the talks that will last until Saturday midnight, congressional leaders have come to an agreement in the debate around a total of 700 billion dollars in days, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said that the agreement is only left to be put on paper.
The compromise was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the programme would work and would be effective, but that further action is needed. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about reversing the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (i.e. two a.m. on Monday in Central European time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
The program is underway, 2008. The draft law, which is called the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of the Year, will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday, and then at the Senate.
George W. President Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night and greeted the White House news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which would have been about the fact that the 700 billion dollars would have been spent one-on-one money to buy low-quality, loan-backed securities.
In the first round, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent by using 250 billion forints immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, out of which the Treasury Department buys bad-rated securities with a credit background, and the fate of an additional 100 billion dollars depends on the president’s decision.
The program will be audited by a separate body, which will also be attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other 700 billion depends on a new resolution of Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made directly through auctions, the ministry officials said.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the assets of concern, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law would provide the means to save up to 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it buys bad assets on a wide scale, or insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to adopt the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
The bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for state assistance, on the other hand, can expect that their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, will be restricted by the government.
Payments are restricted only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys at the auction, an additional tax will be levied on the golden parachute unless the levitated bank manager is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
The picture includes the fact that the existing golden parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones, in order to encourage participation in the program.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs,” said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the banks participating in the program, the state acquires the right to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers decreases, as they can finally win the transaction as soon as the economy and the saved bank recover with it.
The draft law states that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress that sets out how to return expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
“It’s not what the UI’ve asked us to do, meaning it won’t protect the taxpayers’ dollars,” Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, California, said.
Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were called for by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008, compared to the previous month, by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, according to the Central Statistical Office.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, while they fell by 3.9 percent compared to the previous year.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only minimally, by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4.6 percent monthly price increase in the production of bags and 4.6 percent, and the 2.5 percent monthly price increase in the production of footwear.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals and product manufacturing sector (1.6 percent).
Prices fell in the petroleum processing (1.4 percent), the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 percent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In August, prices increased by 0.3 percent in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, mainly due to the overriding effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In 12 months, prices in the petroleum processing sector increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4 percent) in terms of domestic sales in the manufacturing sectors.
In the production of metal processing products, a price increase of 13.2% was observed in the field of food, beverages and tobacco production, which represents the dominant weight.
Price reductions were made in the textiles, textiles (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 percent and 9.1 percent.
Prices have increased by 10.2 percent in the whole of the manufacturing industry in the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
In August, among the intended groups in the sectors, the capital goods sector had the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and downstream sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest increase in prices was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 percent) compared to the same month of the previous year.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we saw a price increase of 6.8 percent, while in the case of capital goods we saw a 1.4 percent price decrease.
The export sales prices of the industry, measured in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August, compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar in one month, by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar in August 2007.
Do you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister spoke about this in front of the leaders of the local Hungarians in Chicago.
In his opinion, “now practically everything depends only on whether the electronic access control and control system will be established overseas in a timely manner”.
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no travel permit under the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is in talks in Washington today.
He meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Middle Cross of the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic will hand over the Star award and hold talks with Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s foreign policy advisers.
Barack Obama and McCain are also on the side of the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, expressed their support for the government’s 700-billion-dollar bank rescue aid package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon talks between the congress and the administration, the representatives of the administration announced at dawn on Sunday that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defrost the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain make themselves look like they are more capable of driving the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melted away McCain’s advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s nomination as vice president.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the law on the 700-billion-dollar package would be passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
“We must act now, we must act with responsibility ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the whole economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time swallowing it, but idleness is simply not a viable option.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a committee overseeing the Treasury and the limitation of the severance pay of the top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the talks, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
Journal review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the electorate became more self-conscious - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to rule on Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, the revolution of Bavaria, devours his fathers, analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process came to an end, which was probable almost exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party ceased.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was mentioned so much in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the modernization that the CSU has consistently implemented in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the moment. However, there could not be without consequences for the CSU loyalty of the electorate to secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of the East and Northern Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization goes hand in hand with the increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can be seen.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the electorate became more self-conscious, more critical and stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks the classical bourgeois groups moved away from the CSU the most; they are free-empliers, craftsmen, graduates and higher education graduates.
The support of the CSU has already shrunk to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who, with whom? The party presidents deal with the confusing domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections in his article entitled “The Curtains on Coalition Issues”.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss the coalition.
The election took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, party leaders barely allowed their cards to gain insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties – it exists in certain provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition could be imagined with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not mentioned.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, then the cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or join the coalition is still completely open to the party, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-and-black coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of the government,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equal Opportunities Summit began today in Paris, hosted by France, which this year represents the rotating Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, drew attention to the segregation of education in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional meeting, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children, and this is also the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
The High-Level Conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The invited parties included representatives of governments, European social partners and the most significant European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP group, Járóka warned that in addition to the discrimination experienced by recruitment, the Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low educational attainment.
“The vast majority of Roma youth do not have a secondary education, and due to poor quality primary education, only an insignificant part of them can obtain higher education.”
Járóka also stressed that as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections in the widest possible way – even between Roma and non-Roma.
Because the Roma student starts school as soon as possible, so that his chances of becoming the productive members of the labour market increase; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
“Roma must ensure their right to quality education under the right of their European Union citizenship and to guarantee the eradication of their low-quality and separate education,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to unite the European Union’s goal and action-oriented cooperation to immediately accelerate the desegregation processes in schools, and the proper enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunity offered by the democratic space in order to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” Járóka said.
In the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" for all, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination set at European and Member State level.
Fox in the henhouse
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign insurance contracts with the applicant on the basis of people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that always links the use of prescribing data to the person concerned.
It should be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the heno to the fox,” said Richard Dick, the developer of the drug-spoken program.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the case of damages condition dependent on the health of the applicant customer, and if they consider the risk too large, they do not take out insurance with it.
He was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer’s identification number, he can easily get from pharmacies what kind of medication the person has bought in the past year and a half, and the program himself concludes what kind of illness he suffers from and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a large dose of cholesterol-lowering, it suggests that you have virtually unmanageably high levels of fat in your blood, which immediately categorizes it into a higher risk category.
Several versions of the program are in circulation, some of them also set a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do but work on paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, such as some compounds can be used against migraine or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former are not.
Separate companies were formed to retrieve and process the data, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient’s consent.
They are now being obliged by the authorities to do so, although they have not been punished for their omission.
Some companies have now processed the results of laboratory tests and also connect it with the drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of the use will become more and more difficult at the same time.
There is a separate health protection law, but it only covers healthcare providers and insurers.
Before the congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities the powers of control over the companies that specialize in providing data.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his programme, which would link the transfer of the data to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another issue is that the person concerned can hardly refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not sign a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox’s benevolence.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
The fate of the decommissioned Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the ugly electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personnel issues has been postponed at the summits of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in place, and it is a question of how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a 17% loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much criticized pair made him realize that they did not cling to their chairs with all their strength.
This was used to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who demanded personal consequences a day after the “bad tsunami” for the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, according to Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only 43.4% of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been “uniforming” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count high in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the reorganization within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the potential successor of Huber, will also be included in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start negotiations on a possible Munich government coalition with the liberal FDP and the Free Eloques, organized along right-wing values.
The strange irony of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited as a coup by the Huber-Beckstein doubles, gets into the legislature on the list of Free Eligators, and then was ruthlessly dealt with the ambitious local government politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been woven from the background, will also play an active role in the transition, and the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
Huber made a few bil-marks to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is somehow not recovered.
Merkel, who has found a hard time to hide her disappointment with the fiasco, said the CSU’s ground loss would not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria by 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No opposition MPs were elected to the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it can be explained by the illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the country’s one-hundred-strong legislature has been destitute for more than a decade, the opposition, which joined forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) before yesterday’s elections, had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate as president for the fourth time in the controversial elections in 2006, would “enge” the appearance of some opposition MPs in parliament.
The ODSZ thus withdrew from the pre-contact boycott.
The opposition’s expectations were due to the fact that Belarus, which is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia – which has taken out a loan to reduce the ever-increasing Russian gas import and contributed to the Russian hands of Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines passing through the country, to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not getting a permit due to the anti-democratic political system.
In advance, the OSCE raised the focus on positive shifts, rather than on shortcomings, such as a third of opposition candidates from running, in the evaluation of the election campaign.
However, the OSCE’s flash report on Monday also criticized the campaign – during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press in essence – and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
However, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to face a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is separating Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two areas to be independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that “power was afraid of letting even an opposition into the weightless parliament”.
The opposition does not plan to take action to see the results, but rather tries to convey its message to the electorate on the need for economic reforms.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are creating obstacles to distribution, but I still see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly,” said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its main achievement, even the most officially supported pensioners does not consider it appropriate.
“Because of the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time for the disruption of social security, evoking the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, who led the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that “people believe not for words, but to deeds,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trade partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue, among other, mostly global problems.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, where it will be mainly about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an uplifting democratic superpower that should have a greater say in international affairs, but the member states have not yet managed to reach a common denominator, whether they support New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. increasing trade turnover to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious target.
In this spirit, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been implemented in a legal sense, i.e. air traffic could soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the meeting.
The goal is to balance that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among its partners.
The summit has paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter was condemned in all its forms on both sides and called for the convening of the UN conference.
They also called for the completion of the Doha trade round, although they both have a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India agreed, as well as the need to make a global deal at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is going to the French capital today, where he plans to do business at the bilateral meeting about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they hope that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to the news agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright notice, the 60. Buchmesse at the fair.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with a floor area of 171,7,790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The guest of honor will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Agriculture: Italy will occupy a 264 square meter exhibition area through the establishment of a unified Italia Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of the 5.0 pavilion of Buchmesse, where there will also be an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Brunetta: "Friends only before working hours"
Uniquely in the history of the Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed for the entry and exit of the workers.
As of today, this new measure will come into force against the skilled workers, to filter out those who block and then go out to drink coffee during working hours.
The anti-slacker novelty was presented today by Regulatory Minister Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The swivel gates,” said Brunetta, “is to work better and more efficiently, reduce absences and increase services.”
“There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the installation of rotating gates is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
“We did not see any resistance from the employees,” the Secretary-General confirmed: “The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated.”
In a word, breakfast is over during working hours, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta smiled and advised: "a good little cappuccino can do wonders at seven in the morning"
The College of Public Administration in Rome
At a meeting held, the Minister said that “in three months, the absences of public sector workers due to illness decreased by 50 per cent, which means 60,000 more people in one year”.
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
“The wage dynamics of which, according to the Minister, have been twice as large as that of the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and has far exceeded the inflation rate,” he said.
At the same time, thousands of civil servants have gathered, joining the petition supported by the Italian Organization for the Environment and Consumer Protection Associations, to protest against the requirements of the Brunetta decree.
“At the time, the Minister of Public Administration boasts data supporting the suppression of the absences due to the disease, the army of ‘farapid slackers’ is constantly growing,” the consumer protection association writes.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative employees across Italy have gathered to declare war on the illegal requirements of the decree.”
The regional administrative court is challenged, among other things, the abolition of supplementary sick leave of sickness due to the reasons of service, the extension of the period of residence of workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects contained in the new provisions prescribed by the Minister.
Workplace Accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 workplace accidents, of which 3 end with death and 27 enduring permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company at work, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and almost twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, Anmil is organising for the 58th time in all counties of Italy, the day of victims of workplace accidents traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organizations and mass media to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying data published by Anmil and the tragic events of recent days confirm that prevention plays a major role in accidents at work,” said President Giorgio Napolitano to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of the People’s Accidents at Work.
The head of state sincerely praised the “conspiratory commitment of the club to prevent at work, the protection of the interests of workers who have suffered accidents, to help the families of the victims and to make the public conspicuous”.
“Natural and sincerely divided outrage by everyone is caused by such tragedies, which, by its size, are the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we are faced with dramatic, repeated cases every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: “We are struggling with a lack of funds, and the financing of education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within schools aimed at the direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of paramount importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation to enforce.
The Speaker of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that “the serious social significance of the accidents at work that ends with death, and the institutions are required to end this as soon as possible”.
“The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“However, we do not want this downward trend to be accompanied by a decreasing attention, because the greatest tragedies happen precisely when attention is under the slowdown.”
“We believe that at the general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome the phenomenon that could be achieved through a complex action programme.
“We believe that there is a need for stricter supervision and control,” Mercandelli said, adding that there would be more marked intervention in the field of workforce training, starting from school education.”
“A further efforts are also needed to inform the public and make it susceptible,” he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that poses a social problem.”
Mercandelli then criticized the “plan deterioration of the compensation safety net for victims of accidents at work” and “the line of aid to which the system has been drifting in recent years.”
“The goal is to give back to the workers the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of those suffering from the accident cannot depend on the arbitrary and sometimes distributing measures of the legislators,” he said.
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Remaining hearing loss may be caused by listening to portable playrs for a longer period of time and at high volumes, such as MP3 devices -
In a report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU’s New and newly identified Scientific Committee for Health Risks (SCENIHR), citing an opinion published today.
“The report shows that 5 to 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour a day for more than an hour a day for five years, can suffer from the end of the study,” the statement reads.
“It’s worrying that young people who use high-volquency portable music players and mobile phones in bulk and often aren’t aware that they can irreversibly harm their hearing,” Kuneva said.
“Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk, to which we urgently need to respond,” he said.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate the information on this.
In the light of this expert opinion, we also need to review the existing control systems so that they can operate with sufficient efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise pollution.
“The researchers confirm that we have cause concern. And the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine what possible measures could be taken to protect children and adolescents exposed to noise pollution caused by portable players and similar devices," the committee's member said.
The current European safety requirement defines the maximum level of noise that can be issued by portable music players in 100 dB, however, there is growing concern for data on hearing loss resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing loss.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for those users of portable playback devices who listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) per week, noise pollution exceeds the maximum value for noise at work.
If you listen to music for a long time in similar circumstances, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of portable device users, which can amount to 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno to set up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, until March, and the results are expected in June.
This timetable was set by the Municipality of Budapest on the operation of the Committee entitled "The Future of the Goal of the Boom Capital", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draft the guidelines of Rome.
Following the final statement in March, the study and the plans will be evaluated in the general assembly and the municipality committee, so that the strategic plan of the capital, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor of Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
“This is a fully independent committee in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented,” Alemanno emphasizes, and his mission is to develop proposals for Rome’s development ideas that political decision-makers, i.e. the Assembly and the Municipality Committee, can rely on.
There is no conflict of interest in competence, we just wanted a platform where great plans for the good of Rome could be made.
In March, after completing his work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed term.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Commission called “The Future of the Rome Capital” committee, the mayor said.
Alemanno replies, to those who consider the Commission to be superfluous and attributable to the opinion it has not binding, Alemanno replies: "It depends on what kind of work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals to be put on the table.
If the standard proves to be appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attal Committee, which I take for granted in the case of Rome, the contribution it will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the management of daily affairs and in the management of urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account far-reaching aspects, look further and plan for a longer term and are committed to the development and future of Rome.”
The mayor of Rome wants to state that “this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless ‘waterhead’, as it is completely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a single euro, but it will serve as an stimulus for thought and aims to involve the most outstanding minds of the capital.”
“There is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump at the standard that it would need so much, thinking about its future in a unified spirit.”
Regarding the future in which the mayor of Rome emphasizes that “it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but also much further away”, we see not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital of the capital, but also “the role that it can fill as the capitals of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region, and which it must fulfil”.
Obama? The first anti-American president. We'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who claims to be independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, ruined the U.S. economy and maintained close ties (as he does as a private person) with hostile Islam.”
As the election dates approach, the attacks on Obama are condensing.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama brazenly believes he can win the highest public law dignitary of a nation with only two governors and five senators who have been black so far.”
These attacks are in fact meaningless; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of voters whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win with a significant advantage.
In this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their minds.
Inside the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial: “We know that in the voting room the real American patriot casts his vote in.
A side of the American way of thinking appears here, which is hidden until the last moment.
“Just talk what you want, and we know where to put the iks, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear by it: if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
There have never been such words until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these arguments, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
Were 1,500 people asked what were the mistakes they made during Bush’s tenure. Eighty percent said it was Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 troops in Vietnam and tipped it in the ass that it flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans did not have to pack.
The majority believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak spot.
A huge task awaits the place of George W.
U.S.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time for austerity has come in the editorial offices. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the print press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists what they think about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, at the moment, almost every journalist is pessimistic about his own future.
However, it was not clear that their concern had decreased in terms of credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsroom, i.e. the editorials that make the newspapers.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public has understood, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, the journalists interviewed say.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65% of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed vs. electronic press.
Press staff is not having any difficulty in seeing where the World Wide Web is going.
The biggest publishers are trying to find their way to the Internet, which many believe is the “killer” of the print press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they would opt for the technology in the hope that it might benefit journalists.
Today, in the American press profession, there is a gap between editorial leaders, the directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, compared to only 23% at the local level.
Some associate this with a secure job.
At the national level, 47% of executives fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this figure is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "sure work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation like the United States of 300 million people, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a “sufficient or needy” basis.
Directors usually receive a high salary, and editors can earn up to ten thousand dollars a month, in addition to paying pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year it is x days, in the third as well as the maximum 15 days after a certain period of time.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often “sick” during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROOMS COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, the president of the second criminal division of the Roman Court of Rome, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to travel from his residence from Groquetirata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy, in the framework of an investigation into the Unipol-BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to the residence ban on the Grottaferra.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have asked the real estate manager to move from a small rural town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commuting commets (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow the company’s cases to influence and access the evidence against it.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago, when the House of Representatives did not vote for the 700-billion-dollar bailout package tabled by the White House: a significant number of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has caused a break within the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, subdued East Coast attitude that supports federal institutions and business circles and the new anti-Washic and financial world line, which is growing in the middle and southern states.
This direction was critically manifested in the parliamentary vote mentioned in the introductory Chamber.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that the economic rearrangement that is still going on, predicted or allowed to show, not only in the United States, but in the whole Western world, and perhaps even outside.
The crisis, in the US and Europe, seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been stagnating for some time in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-union, bringing back the dual category of state sovereignty into the public consciousness in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects banking-financial institutions that, although they have a close relationship with the rest of the world, are primarily and quite widely carried out with them people and families living in a single country, one state.
This, in turn, poses a direct political problem for those in government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be trapped essentially outside the coast: the European Union, which, navigating between different interests and different national strategies, does not be able to set a unified political stance.
Thus, everyone expects intervention, the bailout package, the re-emergence and the new rules from each national government, but most of all the opening of the funds: since only the individual states have economic resources in a tight situation, with a financial stockpile that can be able to put things in order.
They have the means and the power to use them: in the given circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organization will ever have to do so.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the nation-state of the crisis is in full harmony with the fact that recent economic growth attaches importance to a factor that is closely linked to this element: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, and we suddenly had to realize that our future is increasingly dependent on things that are not so abstract, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another are entirely linked to a delimited site, an area.
So those who dominate the area have much more trump cards than those who, unfortunately, were born in a place where there is no harvest, no oil and no water.
I would like to go to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Anyone who declares that it is an area, a state, a government, necessarily says politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it seems that the economic crisis is creating two interlinking phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, those who can take the events in their hands.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the business leaders, bring about the complete loss of credibility, who have proved to be completely unsuitable and have proven that many are still vague areas ahead of them.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, inadequacy and separation, which affects the entire elite of its leaders in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the growing population is convinced that the time of the social elite, which has been at its peak, is over. He expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, culture, in the complex sense of the word, they would have embraced them. This makes the social elite increasingly alien to the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, has a wide-ranging but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in the unexpected “jumps” of the voters, or in recent times, the sudden changes in public mood. For example, the rise of the Conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of Labour unity in Great Britain, or the revolt of U.S. congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right can be included).
It seems that the traditional elite, together with their parties, their programs, and even could even say that, together with their customs, press and renowned intellectuals, they understand less and less, and therefore they are less and less able to represent what has been going on in the deeper strata of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spreading and potentially creating increasingly excessive passions.
Nevertheless, speaking of the “ending rebellion of the masses” would be, frankly, it would be an exaggeration.
But to walk with your eyes open, it is not harmful at all.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
With the help of a super-strong glue, defeat gravity and walk on the wall as Spider-Man.
This is the goal of several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With a piece of adhesive of just 2.5 centimeters, the researchers managed to glue and keep a 100-pound body against a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team was born from the further development of special, so-of-so-carbon nanotubed materials that existed before.
“The principle of glue function should be seen as a packet of spaghetti-like pipe system,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot of the gecko microscopic folds, which provides the perfect grip for the animal.
Tests with various materials such as glass, teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new glue is ten times more efficient than the soles of these reptiles, but at the same time “it’s easy to get off the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
Will you catch a tweak? - "This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, yes, but researchers are more likely to think about using less impressive than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good at conducting heat and electricity.
You can find more applications in space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a hair-like adhesive made of microfiber material that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface, giving it perfect grip.
Medicines? It is forbidden with fruit juice.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These are highly vitamin-like thirst-quenching beverages, which are mainly popular in summer, if they are introduced into the body together with certain life-saving medicines, they will change their absorption, as a case-by-case basis, intensifying or reducing their effect. This can have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks of co-administration of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. At a national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, the professor announced that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice had already been placed on the bench of the defendants when it was revealed that it was able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rate control and nerve medications to toxic levels.
Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official gazette and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-consumption and attention to what they drink when they take on medications such as Diazepam or Metdon.
RELEARED INLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of the drugs.
A list of active substances whose absorption is impeded by grapefruit and other juices could be listed at length.
Michele Carruba, a professor of pharmaceutical medicine at Milan State University, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various national and international pharmaceutical institutes who, if necessary, ensure that they change the data contained in the product.
That’s why we always have to read the information about the medicine you intend to collect, and if something is not incomprehensible, we should not let ourselves be influenced, but we should definitely ask our doctor or pharmacist,” said the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize in Economics for analyzing the territorial context of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neo-Kingnessian Krugman, a professor at Princeton University, and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most fierce critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more crucial consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This prediction has generated quite a few debates, and has been reproached several times by the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little shocked how quickly the public interest came out of the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “crustic economist” but at the same time spreads rather “aggressively the Bush administration’s criticism of excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package was also worth
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is now an open-label suite with personal productivity, which is targeting more and more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from liberals to public administration.
After working with SUN Microsystem and carried out by volunteer developers for almost a year, the new Open Office will come to the public with more novelties: in addition to the welcome screen and the reconsidered, less Spartan user interface, it offers several important novelties. For example, the compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operational system and supports the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is also the specific function of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphics module, keeping the page-place layout.
You can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface, which combines the typical Adobe format with the spreadsheet or word processor items.
Sharing within apps has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other’s work. Each employee’s comment is marked with a different color, which helps to ease the recognisability in the audit section.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice’s features available from the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after being uploaded to the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operational systems, the suite is also available for Linux.
On request, you can take over the installation CD in your home or at work.
Free gratuitousness is probably the biggest attraction in terms of the proliferation of the home application, but the Open Office suite is now also trying to get a ball in the business sector, as it can expect a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of ideal education, consulting and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five core modules: Writer, Word-compliant word processor; Calc, Excel-replacement spreadsheet; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphic module.
2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. But if we consider that with the release of the new version, we are already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is also positive, this is the fourth doping case
On the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed for the Gerolsteiner team, also won the bronze medal and won the best mountain jersey.
The news came out on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver, after the Italian Riccardo Ricce and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner driver Stefan Schumacher, who scored a positive result in the third generation of the EPO’s Cera test.
Kohl's blood sample, like tests carried out in recent weeks, was tested in laboratories in Lausanne and chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian loses its third place and is required to ban it from racing for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, also confirmed the positive results of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test and told the Associated Press news agency that he had indicated a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind Carlos Sastre of Spain and the American Cadel Evans, as well as winning the spotted jersey for the best mountaineer.
INVÁNDORLs: THE NEW YORK TAKE UP TO THE QUESTION, ITALY RASSIST?
Italy has only recently turned into a popular destination for reluctant immigrants.
Is that why you're transforming "Belpaese" into a racist nation? This is the question being discussed in the New York Times, which, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan last month after stealing a box of biscuits, is devoting a long article to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the “doubt of the sight”: the northern regions “there is the strongest integration and the highest employment”, however, “anti-immigrantism and the support of the Northern League are also the strongest here in the country.
To support the escalation of tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also quotes the incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins in relation to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have been discussed as an example of the mood change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also underlined this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met Benedict at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church should cooperate in order to defeat racism.”
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, dispelled all doubts: “After determining the situation of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it is the plane on which Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreckage was discovered, a commission of inquiry was asked to identify the plane and to determine that it was the Bellanca 8kcab that went missing on September 3, 2007, the day when Fosett left Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fosett’s personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.suitable I.D.suits issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was dispatched a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks to form in history.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the earth for the first time with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flying.
Three years later, he by plane to by plane, without landing.
Among his many records are flying over the Andes at an altitude of 14,545 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual recreational SUV with original and distinct designs with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact off-road vehicle”, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is precisely because of this, due to the traditional content, the introductory campaign of the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses a hitherto unknown media communication device, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The billboard action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication will begin with the 3D presentation of the car, whereby the new SUV will be displayed in almost real size and in three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around the Corso Como.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car is emerging from the poster.
Subsequently, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK will be seen one by one, and then it will be assembled into a unified image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Can you attract the interest of prospective customers? We'll see about that.
We’ll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Young Trivento. They're probably being expelled from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in fact, has not caused much trouble so far.
They never clashed with opponents.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers come from Trivento.
And neither Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by the small sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were waved, which included the fans’ hometown: on Saturday they were taken off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleader, the fans of Levski.
The Italian Football Association has provided 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were registered tickets, so it's easier to check the fan team.
The Ministry of Interior has also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one against whom there would be prosecuted, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans who have a football-related criminal record have been denied tickets and departures.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for minutes from the Sofia police, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be punished with a five-year ban.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to Italian, but to all stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can’t set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we also have to fear that hooligans will find followers, that for those less than 150 people, others will join.
“We must immediately suppress this fire, not excuse those who behave like this,” the Interior Ministry said.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s national team match day is approaching in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Committee on Sports Events, which can also count on a division of the Homeland Security Service, on the secret services dealing with fan behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's chanting and swinging arm during the Italian anthem? It is not a crime in Bulgaria.”
He expressed this idea, in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed to the Ministry of Interior’s observation service a few weeks ago (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and formerly by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been Trieste's police chief, the city where a cell that supports the Ultrasalia group since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true is not forbidden to vivify Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of the 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I am not a sociologist, the first man of the observing service added, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime takes place.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s also talk a little bit about whistling of the Italian anthem: it’s not a crime either, but if I may say that, it can’t be called a good education...”
Students suffer from expensive rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for accommodation rented for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Tenants’ Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached such an astonishing proportion that – due to the huge total cost of families – excludes a wide range of students from learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia’s study agency. “The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general increase in prices has also started with local residents.”
In most cases, real estate offers also include a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent restrictions, with related rent rental.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure is needed to provide an opportunity to maximise prices through a review of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, near Brianza, 450 euros are available for a bed; the price of a single room is 650 euros (Bande Nere) from an average of 800 euros (Maliate, Udine and Fiera) but can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed slot costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room in about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed slot costs 250/280 euros if it is double, and 370-500 euros, when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they charge about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 for a double bed.
Some cheaper (five euros per single room) prices are around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt).
You can save something in the suburban districts: a bed and 450 euros a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they charge 300/450 euros for a bed, for one room from 400 to 600 euros. The price range is highest around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed, and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are more important within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU often look for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30% higher than in the case of Italian tenants.
Goodbye good old Cinema Paradiso, the old cinema halls time in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no cinemas, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show what takes place in the Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas – the appearance of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs, and as a result, the atrophy of the unnatural and irreversible ones in the city centers – is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
“When places of history and memory disappear, it’s like a friend who’s gone, a friend of the ones we’ve shared our journey and a lot of experiences,” says Cinema Paradiso director. The film, which was an Oscar 20 years ago, and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival, tells Tornatore the lyrical story of a small-town movie, after a cinematic experience that may have been lost forever.
The data provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, speaks clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed. The biggest losses were recorded in the big cities: 10 cinemas in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront of the regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the spread of multiplexes for their disappearance is the fact that the number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in Italy is the highest in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna has risen by 195 in the last five years.
“The number of Italian units has increased irrationally,” said Anec president Paolo Protti. “We’re just building new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when an urban cinema closes, not all passengers are willing to go into multiplexes.
Not to mention the unpaid funds intended to support operators: the overdue debt of the state is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is a shame that the government does not comply with the existing legislation.
The market would require 16 to 18 million euros a year."
Special attention is paid to the case of Bologna. This is the first Italian city to decide, in its concern over closures, to protect and boost single-room cinemas in the city centre, through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and the benefits to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park at certain parking lots at a discounted rate.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Baghheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that caused me to make Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of the locked Rialto or Quirinale, so I don’t see the dust-faced posters, I’d rather turn my head away. I had so many experiences here.”
Tight ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Giia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges have been made against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno mayor of Rosarno, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal organization.
Gookiee was handcuffed by Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and public administration, as well as a lawyer nephew of the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal network and was charged with 10 million euros in compensation.
“The disregard of all legal and moral rules, and even good taste,” state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay a consultancy fee to lawyer Piromalli.
“So the clan would have had an official visit to the city hall, which would have given us further opportunities to control and direct public administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian region’s general assembly, does not hide the fact that there are “many collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld” in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean.'
The arrests this morning were the continuation of the July incidents, when police announced that they had succeeded in beheading the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to manage the municipality. Gioia Tauro’s municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even because of the alleged entanglements between organized crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor of the dissolution, came to the head of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He shouted a scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He summoned the then Interior Minister’s deputy to court and accused him of plotting everything for political purposes. However, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, the court explained that the Piromalli clan had dared to demand a change of project A3.
The eavesdropping on Dal Torrione reveals that “it was willing to comply with the demands of an extensive entrepreneur representing a group known close to the Piromalli family, and to subordinate the municipality’s decisions to the clan interest.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is just being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, are all renewable energy sources, on which giants like Chevron have sown their eyes, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
For a hundred years, they have been researching the possibility of how to get energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the re-increase in the price of oil give the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by facilities that use the waves of the seas.
This is twice the amount that is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are in momentum.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and signed an agreement on a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting for offshore energy, including those who have been committed supporters of traditional energy.
“Chvron is studying technologies that use ocean energy and is considering working with us,” a spokesman for the U.S. oil giant’s affiliate business told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of the authorisation issued by the US Energy Commission to launch the Alaskan project for the use of marine energy.
This is of no small importance, especially considering that the U.S. is currently producing oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the New York Verdant Power Inc. And the Ocean Power in New Jersey is on the path of energy that can be extracted from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as the details can be known, show a growing interest.
Technology is ready to be developed.
According to experts, this is still a rudimentary technology, especially since the energy that can be obtained from the sea does not dispel the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, similar to those of Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities that have a more significant environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and the buoys are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity is transferred to land on cables under the sea.
There are four similar facilities at the same time, which are only waiting for the federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power generation for a shopping mall and a parking lot with the help of the six submarines in the East River Strait in New York.
At the tide, the movement of the water rotates the shovels of the turbines, and this rotary movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of partners who are only waiting for the permits necessary for the use of energy.
Tradge after waves.
At present, the opportunities that can be exploited by the tidal deserve special attention.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008, on the use of the energy supplied by the tide. This amount is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
