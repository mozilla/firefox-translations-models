The Prague Stock Exchange went into minus by the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after falling sharply in the morning.
Transactions in shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) reached almost half of normal daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday plunge right from the start of Tuesday's trading, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the fall.
This is also how the market reacted to the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Stocks fall in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic drop in stocks on Tuesday, although indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market index was down almost four percent in trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to its index.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and is affecting global financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy autonomously, i.e. independently of the People's Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said US lawmakers should resume negotiations immediately and accept a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the consequences.
The bloodbath of US stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was supposed to spend $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call for support for the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and leading stock indices recorded their biggest plunge in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar drop was in 1987.
The index fell even before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the proposal was not passed in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall freely.
Congress backtracks: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
Top leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush agreed on the broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
But there is no victory yet.
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before it can release the final form of the law and its vote.
The draft support for the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Organizations Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Senate sources say a vote on the bill is likely to take place on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "sobering" subsequently takes place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the form of the market stabilization package should be," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give the government fund its final form.
This should buy up unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which will plunge financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to reaching a final agreement on a draft that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The improvement plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal to Asian trading
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling violently.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said lawmakers are pushing for a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors ahead of the start of trading in Asian financial markets, where the time zone could make the first decision of Congress to influence Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the law, nor whether the trial could be stalled at the last minute due to a problem.
Lawmakers are hoping the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the issuance of the remaining amount, which was set at another $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire funds to buy bad mortgage securities that have lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of hefty severance payments
Senate Banking Committee chairman Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits and timing the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called severance payments of directors participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very this and made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who are having trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing debtors' monthly installments and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, said the proposed plan was a good idea, but it would be very difficult to implement.
"All because it is impossible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute losses," Marek told iHNed.cz website this week.
Marek said it didn't matter whether the plan was approved now or early next week.
"It is much more important that Congress decides as early as this week that they support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
According to preliminary preliminary results, Austria's early parliamentary elections on Sunday brought a noticeable weakening of the two parties in the grand coalition so far and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, has been seriously shaken, has suffered a particularly heavy loss.
In contrast, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the regional superior of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse fared was the ÖVP, which lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results achieved by both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially for the People's Party, which brought about early elections, the results are literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the EPP had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to opinion polls.
However, voters apparently punished him for letting the government fall.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of party chairman and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party executive board.
This development is likely to facilitate an increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
Given the rise of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) won 18% of the votes and the BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - however, the Social Democrats expressed fears about a repeat of 1999, when the EPP agreed to co-govern with the populists (the FPÖ was united at the time, having split from the BZÖ in 2005),  which has even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to national politics in Vienna, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but lost some popularity and dropped from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and did not make it to parliament.
Duel on blade edge: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, you can't make phone calls with any MP3 player.
From this it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
You'll probably have a hard time getting a high-end expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view either.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, then you probably dream of such a turntable.
It is similar to travel, that is, compressed - simply with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
It may be unacceptable for some to pay eight thousand crowns for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a twenty-crown market earpiece.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
There is a wide choice.
Battery life matters too
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but also what most mobiles don't even happen to do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and texting, it can also play music and video, record both, have a camera for better or worse, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures.
The multifunctional mobile also has disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly this is much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) have significantly higher performance.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, expect that they will not play for you for more than a few hours.
If you're even on the phone here and there, get another charger for work to be on the safe side - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
The Next problem occurs when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have universal USB connectors, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope without adapters with miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
With a few exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software for players.
It is enough to charge the device with music from the computer via USB.
Most mobile devices and players already create music libraries sorted by artist, album, genre name, or user rating, for example.
Some devices only depict a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with OS).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing specific equipment, you should first of all inquire about battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, convenience of operation.
If music serves primarily as a background for you and you only listen to it for a short time a day, for example on the tram, any mobile phone playing MP3 will suit you.
And any mobile can do that.
You don't even need to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player can support.
MP3 will handle them all, and the vast majority of the music you get will be in just that format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used and the vast majority of devices can handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the corresponding pages of the provider (or other provider) via mobile Internet and purchase the song or album.
This service alone can be a compelling argument for getting a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offerings are crappy and usually limited to annual radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening, you scan your mobile in your pocket while your forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it even depends on whether you always carry your earphones or at least speakerphones with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which almost all mobiles, but only a few MP3 players, have.
For many, probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
From three to four thousand crowns, you can already get quite a decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you are limited by the lack of output for traditional earbuds.
The best and most technically equipped phones with conventional earphones with holes in a diameter of 3.5 mm can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
However, the advantage of the players is, among other things, ease of use.
With the simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection), really everyone will cope.
Minimal functionality, handling similar to the previously standard cassette player or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of mobile internet accidentally switched on, nor is there a threat of a huge bill for data transmission that follows.
What device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, it can fit into a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do anything with memory cards up to 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy even a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irir.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, making the convenience of operation close to that of an MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has come the farthest in the industry, with its Walkman series mobiles sharing the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the aforementioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic later this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our operators offer practically the same services as their Western European counterparts.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider forcing classic providers to make substantial price reductions.
Maybe it won't be like that for long.
We have already written many times on the Mobil.cz website that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the European Commission's recent move to regulate roaming charges, a controversial situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no real competition to fight.
This may sound counterintuitive, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
Mobile operators, on the contrary, are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, often agrees with this, saying a few times earlier that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic operator probably does not have much chance with its own network anymore (however, it would probably be difficult to find a frequency already).
But however, there is another option - the virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant price reduction, to which classic service providers also had to react.
Meanwhile, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the UK, sounds similar to ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can really succeed.
However, we do not have to look too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In less than half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
To operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus tend to appear as low-cost - offering cheap calls and sms, which, however, is often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages that are at least fifty percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a target group can also be quite a good move.
This is because this provider focuses specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking — whoever they like, who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether an idea similar to that in Poland can work for us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the range of services."
There is no chance in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
This indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic were not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competition arises.
The GTS Novera Group has been making no secret of its interest in launching a virtual service provider for some time, which aims to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only with fixed line but also with mobile telecommunication services.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Negotiations with some of them have already made progress," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Better times may be coming now.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be lucky enough to get the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is still surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is a place for a full-fledged virtual service provider on the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been approached by any other subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica 02's press department told Mobil.cz.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other operators.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, agreed, adding exceptionally with O2: "So far, we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which to build further."
He added: "The T-Mobile network is unlikely to feature any virtual operators until the end of the year.
At the moment, we should have a concrete agreement on our table to think in such a short term."
Vodafone is turning its attention towards meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to discussions with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From our customers' point of view, we consider this to be the most rewarding.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find partners for fast mobile internet and build shared networks."
Responsible agencies - on the same string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
When service providers have something important to them, they are able to work together, as evidenced by the wrangling surrounding the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ was probably around the birth of T-Mobile's U:fon.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But right now, U:fon comes in handy as an argument why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently multiplied with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that entering the market and its services would be highly demanding."
Given this attitude of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest on the part of Czech regulators is downright astonishing.
Meanwhile, it is not only about the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries in the Czech Republic, has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Hungarian Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a typical approach to the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," Kristián Chlapua, from the External Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority said in answer to our question.
A statement from representatives of service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
However, this is more than strange for an agency that is supposed to represent consumers' interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile telephony."
However, it is likely that the interests of the NRIS do not include pressure for a fair functioning of the market environment and a fall in prices.
In this case, the quite touching harmony that emerges from the reaction of the three mobile operators is truly shocking.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just as exactly the same petrol prices at petrol stations are certainly just a matter of chance and tough competition.
"The office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither service provider has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for its market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual operators are also likely to be lacking for the telecom regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of market leadership is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position afterwards.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if this argument were not accepted, it should be at least a warning to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiating with all operators.
Shifting responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole matter.
We have already encountered this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications could not be achieved, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS should be well aware of this, but their interests are probably different.
This works when no one is paying attention
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, of which there are already many in Czech mobile networks, goes unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
Because these are multilevel marketing companies.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Price lists of these companies usually reach only selected ones.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer in contrast to the operator, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a Premier Customer, you will receive special quotes (and other discounts) afterwards.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such pre-emption.
"If the cases you are talking about were to arise, it could be a breach of terms and conditions, which we would deal with and which could lead to the termination of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned may have thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, no service provider defends itself against such a procedure.
These companies make a significant profit from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that their phone does not have the SIM card in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what ČTÚ should be strange to say the least.
In addition, another question arises for the NÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the birth of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the NDA has relatively strong powers to detect such activity and, if it does not want to, it does not have to content itself with explaining to the service providers that they did not suspect anything of the kind and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in practically all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to more or less prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at these moments that regulatory bodies intervened in developed countries, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are handing the whole matter to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies come in handy for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will indeed appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If a service provider were to allow the establishment of a mobile virtual operator, it would be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And maybe we won't be making phone calls more expensive than the rest of Europe.
There are four new versions of the new Czech national anthem.
Choose the best
Listen to four covers of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the Where is My Homeland? new recordings of state anthem.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre led by Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - male or female with solo vocals, choir or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young singers with representative voices that are expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
"From the very beginning, I tried to focus on clear diction, clarity of the lyrics and harmony for both of them, and later for the orchestra," he said.
The Czech state anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
In the Where is my homeland? was first performed at the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's play Tyl Fidlovačka, complete with music by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "new" anthem like
Prague Transport will also deliver via chip card for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will write itself into the history of Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passenger will board metros, trams and buses and will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
The coupon can currently be obtained by about one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30-day, 90-day and annual coupons (valid from 1 January 2009) and save them on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday through the www.dpp.cz website of the Transport Company.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using online trading can permanently forget about the windows of metro stations, where they used to regularly have to stand in long queues for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"At these locations, passengers have access to a counter with trained servers who help interested parties shop online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," says Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can also be saved on Opencard at self-service vending machines installed in some lobbies.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket handlers and passengers may have noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them in the city at the moment, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný added.
The coupon is checked by a vending machine instead of the driver
The vending machines that will start operating tomorrow are easy to operate.
It is enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So, on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly residents of Central Bohemian districts travel to the capital.
"On trains classified as integrated transport in Prague, conductors are equipped with card readers, which are also used to determine the zone validity of coupons," explains Filip Drápal of Ropod, the organization that compiles the timetable for public transport in Prague, explaining the control of line ices.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver's checkout.
Therefore, when entering, the driver must not only be shown the chip card, but also the Opencard must be placed in a specific place on the cashier side.
The driver thus checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not travel by buses around the city and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service machines that save coupons on cards.
Information about the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudetes wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans requested the annexation of Šumava to the United States in 1945.
This is clear from a letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of at least the United States of America.
It was allegedly with this wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This can be seen from a letter preserved from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Česky Krumlov ask the US president not to allow the return to the Czech Republic of the "Šumava county", which Hitler occupied under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops will arrive on German territory in no way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with the words "People who care about the fate of Shumava."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia supposedly could only give Sudeten Germans, knowing the Czech national character, hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US president to take over the protectorate over Šumava "now and forever."
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this territory would be considered a foreign country to us, oppressing and ravaging the minority, and contributing almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors could not sign is allegedly fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
Thus, if the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans in Sumava, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in Šumava County on whether its inhabitants wished to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naïve given the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe that it adequately portrays the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if Czech Germans had minimal suspicion that they would be deported from the country, few of them acknowledged the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to give the Sudetes a kind of autonomy.
Still others hoped to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
During the war, Chalupa served in the navy in the Baltic Sea as a German from Budějovice.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into Holštynsko detention center, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, Czech would be useful for them," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
The most expensive action aimed at road safety in Czech history.
This would be the way to describe the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office hopes this campaign will deter leaders from engaging in dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign, which will cost 150 million, will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
Drivers should be deterred from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they leave.
It wants to address the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what appears in commercials?
Stories that attack emotions, primarily human.
This is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "you do not think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in the pool of blood is the word "you will pay."
This should symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
Viewers are "frightened" by advertising spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Tighten, let the drivers
"Drivers are subject to the 'pull, tighten' system.
For them, 'relax' is when they go through red, for example, saving time.
'Pull' is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
He said signs warning drivers of danger are less effective.
"If the hazard warning sign is installed, it is likely to quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, president of Israel's interim government, spoke of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, namely Jordan's west bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published by Jediot Achronot daily on Monday.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants safety in Jerusalem and wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, has to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to attacks on two cities in July that killed some people and injured a few dozen.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" in the Old City.
"Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work," he stressed.
Exodus from the Golan Heights
Olmert also commented on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace deal with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know what they have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They must abandon their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their association with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must give up their systematic support for Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) terrorism in Iraq," the prime minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations could cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal beetle collection could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be a certain estrangement in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made this announcement in New York after meeting today with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian counterpart.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be a certain estrangement," he said after the meeting, which was held at Czech instigation.
Mukherji said after the trial that it was difficult for the executive to interfere in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of charges and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction covers the matter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
But for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then he would be able to apply for bail and await sentencing, he explained.
Schwarzenberg testified that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the Czech diplomacy chief said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide "competent legal support" to the convict, the Indian minister mentioned.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
"It is in our best interest to preserve the best relations with India with many years of tradition.
Indians recognize that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistake indeed," he said.
Asked whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister avoided answering.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he noted.
Questions after an accident: Are flight attendants illegal in buses?
The law does not know them, you are not allowed to walk around in a coach
The tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, raised questions about whether flight attendants and passengers could travel in the bus while travelling.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of flight attendants are in contradiction with the Law on Transport Activities," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, it was caused by the death of a twenty-two-year-old attendant, possibly caused by the driver of a truck crossing the path of the bus.
Unfortunately for her, she was sitting next to the driver at that moment, in the least safe place on the bus, even though two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may also collide or brake abruptly at the moment when the attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
Whether the bus has a standing position according to the registration certificate plays a role.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency coaches have no standing spaces; which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, the company's director.
"We tried to find a solution with the ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn and we concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seat," he said.
The law does not know the flight attendant
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of flight attendant - there is no legislation regulating this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited from providing services by any legislation.
The Road Traffic Act only recognizes the concept of a vehicle attendant; does not define its rights and obligations," spokesman Hanzelka adds less clearly.
Josef Pokorný, director of the road vehicle operation department at the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has a standing room on its registration certificate.
And that's the end of it," he says.
Buses are differentiated into urban with standing places and limited maximum speed, between urban with standing places and permitted higher speeds, and long-distance buses without standing places and at maximum authorised speeds, with seats with seat belts.
As on an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, traffic safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem with the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in the course of continuous progress, the situation can be compared to service on an airplane.
Here, too, you are not sure when there is turbulence and the flight attendant may bang your head."
"However, if the bus brakes suddenly, of course its physical laws apply.
In the same way as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be solved by internal rules by the carrier," he says, also believing that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura ready to discontinue services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer cabin crew services.
It employs two hundred flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their occupation risky.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that the occupation of flight attendants is risky, I will eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
That would also be cost savings," he says.
Alexei Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency, cited safety reasons for the lack of flight attendants in his vehicles.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal injury," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An incredible tragedy happened
A young flight attendant from Plzeň, who had been working for the company for two years, died during a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered out of the emergency lane without using a turn signal and blocked the bus path.
The driver of the bus made a sudden maneuver to dodge, but the right front of the bus collided with him.
The fact that the two reserved places for the rest of the flight attendants were sold is rejected by Jančura.
"These seats cannot be booked on long-distance flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By compensating the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's ruling, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law could clarify the movement of flight attendants on board the bus, which has been worked on for more than a year by a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, the group did not come to any concrete conclusions.
The buses are not so much concerned, but rather the points system deals with the maximum speed limit on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be anything that fundamentally threatens the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, adding that the police and employment offices are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
You approach the electronic wall map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing into the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area, meanwhile, is the size of the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division's thirty-member team on ocean and sea law.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes complements.
There is work momentum and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources that has hardly been known before.
Petroleum, ore and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which could be the key to the development of a cancer drug, for example.
Larger-than-land seabed
Coastal states are now intensively bidding for new undersea areas.
They assert their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1982.
It is primarily about the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a particular country.
Such a country, according to the convention, has exclusive rights to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Put simply, continental shelf refers to the part of the seabed and its underlying layer that is the natural continuation of the undersea continent.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles of so-called purely economic zones," Mikulka explains.
The request, which the country submits to the Committee for the External Borders of the Continental Shelf, must be accompanied by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and professional-technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the committee has considered five applications: those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea country, recently resonated around the world.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed awarded to it by the commission covers an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers, or six times larger than the territory of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The gains from future use of the seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting applications.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of ratification of the 'Montego Bay Convention'.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention to be the "common heritage of mankind" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right of exploitation in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"However, the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, exaggerating by saying that "some of its territories are legally clearly delineated and their regime is contracted."
Czechs in the Pacific Ocean
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of a joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
Under the Convention, this organisation was granted the status of 'pioneer investor' in 1991, like investors from some other countries.
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is articulated there, it is a kind of undersea copy of the Tatras.
"On this total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be extracted.
The area is rich in polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan from Hindu.
Rober Sandev, Macedonian employee of the division, gives another example of concretion.
It reminds me of a potato or, with a little imagination, parchment with magic words that brought the Golem to life.
Düsseldorf hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB's board of directors to the bank's staff is not short of big words.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Deca-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central capital market organization of the savings bank financial group", according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competency block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors seeking to demonstrate its capacity to act in difficult times.
After all, WestLB bank, which is in a precarious situation, continues to come under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there was a tight deadline for finding a lasting solution.
For savings bank customers, however, the relationship between Deca-Bank, famous for its investment funds, and WestLB has been a topic for quite some time – also from the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, head of Deca-Bank, already announced at the end of August, when presenting the half-year data, that he did not see any point in a merger between the bank on Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
Nevertheless, Deka's Board of Directors, half composed of representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of representatives of savings bank associations, mandated the Board of Directors to negotiate joint business activities with WestLB.
In doing so, capital market business or parts thereof may come into play.
However, financial circles say, negotiations have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, Deca-Bank, one of the most important employers in Frankfurt's financial sector, is not the first to come up with the consolidation of the savings banking sector.
For a moment in 2003, it seemed that Deca-Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Palatinate and Helaba respectively.
However, nothing came of this triple alliance.
Hardly any of the plans were made public, and the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks could not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Palatinate was instead transferred to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a relationship between Deca-Bank and the Landesbanks has been raised again and again.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, spoke out against plans to merge with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a recognition of the need for convergence between the various banks in the public sector.
Now, following the Bavarian regional assembly elections, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected to be the first to connect.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it may slowly run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger business partner, even though he has weathered the financial crisis significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with WestLB was ruled out earlier this year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which owns an 85% stake in Helaba.
For lack of a better one, NordLB remains.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, there is the question of how the different business models of individual banks fit together.
Merl said in June that the German Savings and Giro Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should secure the future of Landesbanks.
Finally, it is conceivable to break up WestLB, which is obviously not desired there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also states that they are striving for a "complete solution" in any case.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with Deca-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
This is Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, Luca says.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-branded five-liter barrel, stands a bearded man with a strong build, telling the 200 or so people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep he can get sounds out of his throat.
Elena first pats Luca's cheek, then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses leave at 23.45 to "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arriving at 6.30 am.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, the fourth is exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans were already singing along with their flags, already beginning the celebration during the night.
And so loud that it's not for Italians," says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long faux-fur coat and wide, silvery glasses.
She has been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, organizing three trips this year alone.
Night there, daytime Oktoberfest, home at 10.30pm.
Accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, this includes welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a German-language tour - Marco completed a German course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses plunge into the night on the motorway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, no yet.
The bus quickly becomes quiet and passengers are asleep.
That's right, they're still going to need their strength.
They will rest in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on motorway 8 will also take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half-past seven as planned, there are already nearly 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last briefing to explain the war plan.
First: Everyone should put on their yellow caps.
To the left is the inscription 'Oktoberfest' written in fractur letters, next to which the internet address of Marco's travel agency is 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second, "When the doors of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying places at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we will get stuck, and let not all those with yellow caps sit on the same benches, but scatter them throughout the tent!"
A one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, roars Marco.
And don't forget about tipping.
"Show the security guards that you are well behaved.
As you leave your seats, they will be occupied!"
Third, "Be here again tonight at half-past eleven." Understood?
And head to the Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men acts as a signpost tying yellow caps to trees, signs and even an election poster of one of Bavaria's major people's parties.
It is necessary to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend."
There are no exact figures; There is talk of 50,000 people crossing the Alps, rushing into beer tents, with ten percent of all visitors coming from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean policemen, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, whose national statistics put Italians in first place with about 200 medical care, ahead of Austrians (about 80) and the British who are on the bottom step of the podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said only last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word "relatively" and even included in his speech that the German banking sector is not spared from crisis-like developments.
Because that happened over the weekend.
Munich-based real estate financing firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on Daxon, has received billions in loans from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amount to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the portion used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
This is due to losses incurred by the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa lent money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for extremely short-term projects - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros and the equity ratio declined moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net income from cash business fell to zero compared to the same period last year, while revenues from credits to receivables and certain securities, as well as from the liquidation of provisions for the loan business, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursement of the ex-post clearance costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the levy regulation and deals for group companies, was the revenue deficit of around 16% relatively moderate.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state financier first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Since there was little to earn from classical public funding, Depfa threw itself more heavily into infrastructure projects and private-public-partnership (PPP) projects between private investors and the state, and expanded its activities internationally.
On the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now make write-downs that have a "material impact" on the group's income statement, they said quite generally.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
The dividend was already reduced by a third by 2007.
Since taking over Depfa Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing, since it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has dried up as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate said in a statement that the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and that the company is protected "from the influence of international financial markets, which are currently largely dysfunctional."
According to other sources, thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to resort to financial markets for the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After news late on Saturday that the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, even a temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, bond prices are holding up quite well.
While first-ranked debts are little changed, the prices of lower-ranked bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis is particularly affecting the bonds of its former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, maturities extending beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their stability of value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system in the wake of the intensification of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis to home by taking over Depfa
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the assumption is to repay annuities on time.
Or what almost no one dares hope for at the moment will happen: that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the face of reports of partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on certainty has now vanished into a mere legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to discard their investment can cause sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to set aside a reserve for taxes on exchange gains in future years.
German special forces were present at the hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and the specialists came.
When the situation became serious, special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are coming to light.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to specialists from the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Flying Corps, the Federal Crime Office, and logistics experts from the German Technical Service were also at the scene of the release.
Ministry spokesmen said Monday evening that German forces were not needed as the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of forced hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to bring it in as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping in the southern Egyptian desert area, hostages were taken back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remains unclear, as are the details of how the hostages were freed or the possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He declined to comment on the details of his release.
Berlin has not yet provided any information on when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily newspaper "Bild", the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on an Airbus plane of the German Air Forces on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German chick is a total "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange student blog, she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was very nervous.
I was already inflamed on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, on the way to Kawasaki, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I did not get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to trickle in from eight o'clock, until at 8:40 a.m. a short conversation with the teacher, called the "home room", begins.
But before teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type to like to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my landlady, along with a blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the cathedra in this attire and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language a good two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering, giggling, and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I already knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I quickly slid to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled broadly, feeling honored that the exchange student was seated next to her.
The rest of the hour was quiet enough, but when the bell rang, they rushed in order.
Everyone was talking and laughing and drilling holes in my belly with their questions - even though it is quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone then unpacked their bento.
My host prepared such a lunch for me too - it's completely different from boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, a salad made from cucumber and seaweed, fruit and meat wrapped in a kind of tofu.
Most of the time I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The dishes look strange and have a completely novel taste.
In fact, everything is very tasty.
Well yes, except maybe for the salty plums, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is not simply lunch.
It happens that a girl presents a boy with a bento made with her own hands, which she assembles especially artistically - in the hope that during the lunch break she will get to know the boy more closely.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here as well.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always replied:
"Because it just fascinates me."
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they describe, I started learning Japanese at some point.
So it was very clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I am attracted to tradition and customs.
And they are held in high esteem here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The US House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The lower house of the US Congress defeated by a narrow majority a proposed $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program to curb the chaos in financial markets did not get a majority.
Supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party negotiators, called on lawmakers to support the plan, even if the plan is unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
The Dow Jones fell more than 6% or 600 points during the vote.
Investors were worried that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of voting, only to fall again after its failure became public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The program requires approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats also have emotions.
A rat or a moth flees in case of danger. Does this mean that he feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Animals have emotions too.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
For many years, famous scientists have been publishing their articles in the Internet journal "Edge".
In one of its series, SPIEGEL ONLINE is a selection of answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
However, in this case, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and discuss issues of perception or consciousness in general, we find ourselves in difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many animals do: pretend to be dead, flee, or attack.
People behave in similar ways, from which some researchers infer comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to those of animals.
Circuits associated with human consciousness, on the one hand, almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive / management functions).
This wide area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are, or the ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since much of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals are excluded.
However, even if consciousness were not dependent on language, language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might be like in other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of special hardware it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research poses serious problems for us.
Most of my discussion concerns the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The processes of consciousness of animals could be investigated regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens with experiments on short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, this hypothesis, examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What does this mean in terms of emotions?
I trace this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activities.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies working memory.
When viewed in this way, emotions are closely related to areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
Complemented by language, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states in order to describe them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions originate from simpler activities in the body perception areas of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could easily play a role in cross-species emotions.
I cannot refute this purely theoretically, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to rats and humans to be fear is likely to feel fear in both cases: How can you check if rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in case of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, just similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience.
Although neural comparisons help further: rats and humans have similar brainstems, cockroaches don't even have brains.
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in humans, how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, and maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm researching the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't research emotions either, because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
After all, I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said preparations would soon come under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its belief that Ukraine can organise the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and much remains to be done in both countries."
Both host countries are lagging behind in terms of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible to reduce the number of European Championship stadiums from eight to six.
"We cannot waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
Following a series of scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of Poland's PZPN federation, which was replaced by independent supervisory commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"We have sent a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini stating that this will not adversely affect preparations for Euro 2012."
Last season alone, several First League teams had to be relegated to the lower division due to manipulation, and eventually the start of the league had to be postponed.
Directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter promises to be for German tour operators.
According to one study, traffic bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak outlook for economic activity, Germans' appetite for travel has not waned, according to the study.
Travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover for winter bookings compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a study by market research institute GfK, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
Travel agency turnover in October was about 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly in demand, DRV said.
Here, bookings increased by around a third.
Other German destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Package holidays are most in demand, said DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Due to rising energy and food costs, package holidays "cost better for passengers than for individual package holidays."
Passengers can save money with early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
Booking rates in the summer months were also very good, so traffic will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook trips compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she has got into trouble with her ex-husband. Hollywood star Meg Ryan has labeled her ex-husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
Who snarls - and fights back
Belated Wars of the Roses by Ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are fighting an ugly fight in public with each other.
Meg Ryan opened up about the reasons for the divorce for the first time last week in an interview with InStyle: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, which caused a lot of pain."
It wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis had cheated on him with.
The spiritual striptease took place because of Ryan's press work on his new film "The Women," which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid reacted strongly to his call for an unfaithful husband: "It's terrible," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg keeps repeating and retelling the story of our relationship."
It is also "unfortunate" that their 16-year-old son Jack is repeatedly "publicly reminded of all the pain and change that divorce brings to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of twins.
Therefore, his response ends with the following side cut: "In any case, my life goes on.
I am happy to have a wonderful family where everything is in perfect order."
Prices for air tickets and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become cheaper by as much as 50 percent.
Flights and hotel room prices have improved again – according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after a price increase in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
However, in the April-June period, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this as the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to "a slackening appetite for travel among American tourists."
The fall in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
There was also an increasing trend in air ticket prices in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more in economy class than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel requirements increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, economy class flight prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but prices in business and first class showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose 11.9 percent and fell 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights in Germany has halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price decline is partly due to moderating economic growth, the company said.
Demand weakened in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe is increasing competitive pressure.
The tense situation is underlined by the cancellation of unprofitable flights by airlines, and many airlines filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV moved to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein zoom Deep dive for national team Marko Marin.
The player from Gladbach only got into the game late and his lift bounced off the goalpost.
His precise message left his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the cabins in the Hamburg arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger was HSV's physical therapist for nearly three decades, more respected than some former players.
Thus, his request was heard in the competent place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command could have been similar: Here with the second goal!
The command was not executed.
"Today it wasn't always pretty," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also had a "more relaxed vision".
The 1:0 (1:0) goal result was scored by the Hamburgers thanks to a header from Mladen Petric (11th); And the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachers could not inflict pain on the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol concluded.
Hamburger SV turns 121 this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which showed their team as the top of the league's class.
It's going to be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the intermediate record in the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly recovering thanks to late-committed signings - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and Jansen acquired from FC Bayern - it is not yet shining.
"We need more sense and trickery," Jol demanded.
My first Oktoberfest
Repetitive ballermann hits, litre pints of beer and celebrities wearing design dirndli.
Debut at Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually look much alike.
She is blonde, a TV presenter, and wears a tailor-made dirndli.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my dress in the grocery store.
But one thing unites us: We've been on Wiesn for just three minutes, photographers are already rushing in and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesn.
This is how we make friends.
Cheap dirndli seem to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the equator made of white sausages, my comfort is still limited by the national costume.
But when you arrive at Theresienwiese, things aren't so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndli or leather trousers; No one looks at you with a grin or embarrassment - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are only reaped by my dirndli apron.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to the fact that I tied the apron wrong: "You are free tied to the left, virgin in the middle, sold to the right, widowed in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from back to left.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others make less fuss about subtle flirting techniques, wearing simple felt hats that say "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and showing off their naked backs unsolicited.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is named Bob and also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very fantastic, stretching out the "aaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after getting rid of the contents of the jar he drank earlier.
Right next to one of the hydrants that everyone looks at as a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the notorious "forbidden urinators."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers rush through the scene and take care of the poor mist.
The nurses always appear in teams - four people carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrive empty, leave packed.
Who is lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarpaulin is not visible.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the sanitizers shouts to me in response to my question, and then in the hustle and bustle.
After the vote
Fear permeates Wall Street.
The initial news of the bailout failure caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
It was the largest loss of points in a single day in its history.
Later, the Dow strengthened somewhat.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down a good 5 percent to stand at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq, which trades technology stocks, fell more than seven percent to 1548 points.
The biggest loser for the Dow at the moment was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
Not a single paper has strengthened.
Shares of Goldman Sachs bank plunged nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, large investor Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, they do not intend to pay the amount all at once, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive equity option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be redeemed if exchange rates developed properly, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and US and stock prices on a downward trajectory
The billions in aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors' doubts.
The share price of German big bank Hypo Real Estate is plummeting, taking Dax by itself.
The US Dow Jones index is declining despite the government's planned bailout of the financial market.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The Munich-based real estate financier's share value fell by a quarter despite bailouts from the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax dipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded 5839 points with a minus of 3.7%.
Stock markets around the world have been brought to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the U.S. government's $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, with a Senate vote scheduled for October 1.
Other European stock markets knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei index sank 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
India's Sensex index fell 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to close at 12,595.75 points.
On the Mdax exchange, Arcandor shares weakened following the announcement of the capital increase.
The Sal. Private bank Oppenheimer subscribed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism concern also said that Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during a so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity may not be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew in outer space for almost 18 years.
Due to fuel lines that will soon freeze, they are threatened with death from frost.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational rocking maneuver of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
Thus, probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
But what has fascinated researchers for years: Flying objects don't behave quite as one would expect based on ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in speed.
The probes accelerate or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which conceives of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, remains adamant that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"Dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, possibly even found as far as Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter became known to space scientists only ten years ago.
Apparently, it exerts a force of gravity that has an observable effect on other celestial bodies.
However, matter itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists have calculated that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt freed
After ten days in the captivity of their abductors, the tourists deported in Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros in ransom.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
Negotiations on the ransom fee are already underway.
Time and again, Germans become targets of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists deported in the Sahara are free.
This was unanimously reported by Egyptian state television, Arabic TV station Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian television station Sky TG 24 reported that Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently looking at their health," Frattini said.
The five German, five Italian and one Romanian national, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain obscure: An Egyptian security official said the hostage-takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them in a surprise manner.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," the official said.
"It was just about taking over the hostages," when suddenly "the surprise came."
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers and arrested two on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; The money was supposed to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper al-Masri al-Yom, citing a German intermediary, reported that the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage-takers will release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
The men are held captive by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Police have named the victim of the accident
Police have named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in hospital.
Chelmsford Road resident Carole Paulson, a resident of Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, in the city.
He was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather's violence 'led to suicide'
The court heard that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had abused her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians in Cornwall, spent 6 years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The Truro criminal court has learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of her confessions, Trerise wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
The trial heard that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in Plymouth's Mutley district on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court hearing revealed that Miss Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering with the National Trust, was haunted by the horrors of twice-weekly violence.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was described by friends as "emotionally dead" and had "given up on life."
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his Plymouth apartment.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr Randle clashed with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his testimony in a letter: "I always bound and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass him.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for sure this was horrible for your victim, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more puzzling, however, is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have gone to court."
The judge added: "I draw attention to what Stephanie's parents think your crime has affected their daughter over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she probably would have been a hopeful, successful, and happy young woman."
The official who lost important data was charged
The BBC understands that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June has been charged with violating official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two top-secret documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law and there is no suspicion of intentional conduct.
Frank Gardner, the BBC's correspondent for the Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat the incident as an internal matter," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about preserving information.
The state prosecutor's office recommended that the charge against the official be represented by the Metropolitan Police because of his highly sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay your B&amp;B bill
Britain's housing cooperatives could face bills in excess of £80 million after Bradford &amp; Bingley bank was bailed out.
The government has spent £14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million account holders with Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
The president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "frustrating" that companies and their members had to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid after Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages have been repaid.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing cooperatives were among them.
It is frustrating that institutions that have already acted prudently ... We now have to pay the bills of institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company must pay in proportion to the deposit amount it holds. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Treasury estimates that the loan amount will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means companies will have to set aside £81 million to pay first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the housing companies' union, told the BBC he thought the measure was unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions that have acted prudently during the boom in the housing market have to pay the bills of institutions that are far less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since they began operations in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bill," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for a full year, which can be twice as much as today.
Since housing cooperatives are mutual societies without shareholders, eventually members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest rates on their deposits.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the ends of the platforms, with a tower at the front corner of each, and looks like something like a German country town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly bulging.
However, looking inside the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a grandiose undertaking this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation, in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of the conquests, wanted to realize its ambitions to conquer the Middle East with the help of this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station fared no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the elaborate roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was an act of sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin and has been well beyond history.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves, at least symbolically, as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The hallmark of the new policy is commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Hamas and Fatah groups in Palestine, with Iraq, with Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
Wanting to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, I boarded the overnight train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of rumbling, which at the time set the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended to be a symbol of the new secular state that turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This aroused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel building made specifically for this purpose - located in a developing suburban neighborhood between half-finished shopping malls and cafes. It is in the latter that middle managers in suits - both men and women - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have fit in with a centre-right politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry with him.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War upset order," he said.
Turkey was isolated from its hinterland.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to be at a crossroads."
He then emphasised what almost everyone I spoke to here repeated almost mechanically: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea benefit Europe and the United States as much as Turkey itself.
It is as if they were trying to send out the message that, figuratively, the whole of Europe, including Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East by those eastbound railway lines.
When I was back at Hydarpasha station, after another night spent mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, the two German gentlemen who watched this ornate structure build 100 years ago.
How would they have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands?
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was once called the "sick man of Europe."
At least at that time there was no question which continent would lay claim to this exciting country.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey-based dairy company announced it will raise the wholesale price of milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since a two-penny increase in February and following a survey conducted by a consulting firm.
It is up to retailers to decide whether to pass on price increases to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
A former Bangladesh MP's request to defend himself at large has been rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former MP Sheikh Hasina's application to defend himself at large, meaning he could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court denied him a defense at large on charges of extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman while he was in parliament.
This case is just one of many corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demands that the country's military-backed interim government grant her full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of release whether he will be able to maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal the appeals court's decision to the Supreme Court.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application on the grounds that it was not necessary since she had already been provisionally released and was undergoing treatment abroad," Rafique-ul Huq told the lawyer.
"We will appeal the appeals court's decision."
His lawyers argue that he needs to defend himself at large so he can return to the country and prepare for elections in December.
A leader of the Awami League party said Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about Afghanistan's polio vaccination programme
According to the UN, almost 200,000 Afghan children have been left out of the recently organized polio vaccination program due to violence related to the Taliban.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct the work of thousands of vaccine personnel.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV rejected
BskyB's appeal against the decision of the Competition Law Commission, which ordered it to reduce its interest in rival TV station ITV, was rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee found that BSkyB's stake impeded competition and gave the company undue influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL – which has since been renamed Virgin Media – from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's stake from ITV threatened ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV stake was pointless and disproportionate reparations - especially given that BSkyB said it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. attorneys general's case
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys general.
The move followed a report by the Justice Department's inspector general on the case criticizing government officials' decisions.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because of fears that state prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation tried to obstruct justice by lying.
"Serious allegations involving a possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine attorneys general from their posts by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that state prosecutors had been dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the sacked state prosecutors received no worse ratings than many of their other colleagues. As a result, many have concluded that there was a political motive behind the layoffs.
Some state attorneys have been involved in the criminal prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others have refused to participate in investigations into election fraud allegations against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys general conduct investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
The then head of the justice ministry, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, came under attack over the dismissals and eventually resigned.
Several other Justice Department officials have also tendered their resignations.
In his report, the superintendent highly criticized Gonzales' role in the case. He said the attorney general had "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, had "resigned" from his leadership role and had "conspicuously withdrawn" from the process.
He criticizes other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to the elder Bush, for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic gets recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive accolades at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who will receive her special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said she was honoured to receive the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, being shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend the boundaries of time or genres, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is one of them."
The song composed by Jim Steinman required a very large sound, and that sound belonged to Meat Loaf.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" remained on the charts for almost nine years and continued to sell over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf — real name Marvin Lee Aday — has been struggling with health problems lately. Among other things, in 2003, he underwent surgery for a heart rhythm disorder after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it turned out that a cyst was located on his vocal cord.
An unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and perhaps soon sold
New York City has thousands of boulevards, boulevards, and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others perform a purely practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals would find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and runs north from First Street — without reaching Second Street — between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long and looks much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard map.
However, the street has its admirers.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to repave the Extra Place and ensure that shops and boutiques in the new buildings can be reached in a cleaner way.
Among the admirers of the street are long-time neighbors who were struck by the fact that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past prior to renovation.
However, the owner of the street, the city's building conservation and development department, has no interest in insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district council's land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay presented a proposal that the builder would purchase the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain under the city's management and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, district manager of the No. 3 municipal council.
"Very little land is already owned by the city, and we want the Extra Place to remain with the city," he said.
"There may be suggestions for its renovation and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to make sure it remains accessible to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced plans to repave the small street and provide it with seating. Some of these would be used by a café, to which the builder is expected to lease some land.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first revealed at this month's meeting.
Avalon Bay spokeswoman Michele de Milly said that while the company would like to use the street, it doesn't insist on owning it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this rundown alley and turn it into a pleasant public space," he said, adding that the city proposed buying it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office of Building Conservation, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office's job is to improve the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
According to some, it was called "no man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his numerous children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
CBGB, a punk-rock monument that closed in 2006, had a back exit to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known for being where the photo on the cover of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia" was taken.
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothing, barrel and poster pieces, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how the middle class took possession of East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others cite the Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" ("Book of Lamentations: Bitter Nostalgia for the Procession of the City's Extinction"), posted on his blog a story about Extra Place that appeared in the "Urban Gossip" section of the weekly newspaper "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, "Extra Place is a narrow, little cul-de-sac, dark even during the day, flanked by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, and where week-old newspapers are carried by the wind in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street past the back door that used to lead to CBGB and now belongs to the higher-priced clothing store set up in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-liter beer bottle lay next to a discarded, pile of fresh newsprint.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could be renovated.
Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on Bilingual Education: Continued Exposure to the English-Language Environment
In this section of Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California Studies at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and senior director of educational research, is the co-author of "Not As Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
This includes Barack Obama's proposals on education.
According to Obama's campaign, "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and that's true.
To overcome such achievement gaps, Obama's education plan explicitly supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes non-English language schooling, outweighs his interest in overcoming large achievement gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep contract elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of pupils, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of fourth-graders scored excellently on the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Equally impressive, 93% of fourth-graders excelled in the English Language and Literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved with the tool that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, says the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English when teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said, "We have had an overwhelming success in that if you walked into a classroom, you wouldn't notice who the student was who was a newcomer from Mexico 12 months earlier."
"It works," he concluded, "It works for us."
Would Obama set an example for other schools with significant numbers of Hispanic and English-speaking students to emulate schools like Sixth Street Prep?
The school's achievements should be clear, but because of his own party's education policies (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his own consistent advocacy of bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently disparaged the issue when he said people shouldn't worry so much about the "exclusively Englishness" of legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should get their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to narrow the gap in results, he should seriously study the models that work, rather than look down on and ignore them.
Renewed concerns about the economy have led to a sharp fall in oil prices
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Trading Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month before falling back under the influence of immense uncertainty in financial markets.
Concern reignited investors on Monday after congressional leaders announced they had reached an agreement over the weekend on an economic bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time.
In the latest event in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation's banking business, the government announced Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the desperate weekend talks "do not appear to have helped revive stock trading."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities such as oil is expected to fall as well.
"The future of the market for ordinary stocks, interest rates and currency exchange rates around the world has become uncertain," an analyst at Deutsche Bank wrote to investors.
"We believe that the commodity market will not escape the 'pandemic' either.
The biggest question for the commodity market is to what extent the U.S. 'disease' is infecting the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption fell as economic growth slowed, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, cutting their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team set its record
After spending more time with the Jets than anyone else in the Jets for more than eight seasons, defensive end quarterback Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals' lackluster play came into full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Quarterback Brett Favre threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. It was the perfect precursor to an afternoon during which their unfolding collaboration developed significantly.
Favre threw two more touchdown passes to Coles in that quarter, including when two consecutive cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the effort," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's one hell of a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing the ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw it back for 32 yards, which earned it a touchdown.
Safety player Eric Smith reached into another pass and got the ball.
Linebacker David Bowens managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hands.
That final turn of events could have been the most amazing moment of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to make it 34-0.
It was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter so far.
When asked Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When told they had done both — the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter while the Jets didn't score any — Mangini said, "I have to say I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I enjoyed the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short period of time."
A rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best middle- and long-distance runner who ever lived when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday. This made him the first person to complete the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on a comfortably flat track in a time of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds on his previous time of 2:04:26 in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set the 26th career world record in so many different fields that he won a world championship or achieved a world record in almost every distance from the 1500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon for fear — which in retrospect may have proved overcautious — that air pollution would exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny weather, initially 9°C and finally 13°C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since runners who have not previously competed in a marathon, such as: Gebrselassie and Kenya's Paul Tergat have turned to longer distances, with the marathon record dropping by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a time of 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramped his calf two weeks ago and had been unable to train for two weeks.
Apparently, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so pleased," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything went well."
He has received some criticism — particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival — for using too many aids in his races, generally avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his pace runners as if he were running on a track, and putting world records ahead of competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint in 1:02:04 on Sunday with four Kenyan pace runners.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, set the pace for Gebrselassie after the pace runners tired.
With just over 4.8km to go, Gebrselassie passed Kwambai with one final sprint, finishing second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, had a remarkable year with the seventh-fastest time of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko made a surprise victory in the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
He was unable to compete at the Beijing Olympics due to an alleged back injury, but recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his personal best by five minutes. This was the third marathon distance running he took part in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain a significant lead, and after running about 30 km, he followed them.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of blacks
Nestled in Greater Orlando — miles away from everything glittering, loud and vast — is a quiet little town where the pride and intricacies of African-American life experience were born.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate into the country and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two schools without prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville celebration is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he describes and makes a tourist attraction — which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Crisis Era Federal Writers Project — stands apart from its surroundings.
He is as independent, dignified, and aloof as he was in the 1930s, when, as Hurston wrote, urban Florida blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people, who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing out."
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages open discussion on the issue of race, many here distrust the gazes of outsiders.
"We are very careful how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all her life and is a member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be said correctly."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
It is both a historic model of black advocacy and a community of nearly 2400 people where poverty rates are double the national average.
It is partly a literary hub and partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, Southern, urban, black culture that emerged as a result of American slavery, flourishing in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the inhabitants are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (that's what everyone calls Hurston here).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which lies off Route 17. It's the road from Florida's long-forgotten center to a site of black history and human drama.
Hurston, brave as a drumbeat in life and literature, introduced readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then delved into more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road is the modern public school, with a white border on a brown background, carefully kept courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller tends though he can hardly read or write."
She mentioned the widowed Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything you might need in temporary shelters."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really did not please everyone.
"Zora told things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston immortalized them by quoting from glitzy songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Hurston is still remembered here as the lively eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a rumbling Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes and wearing long trousers in a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were foreskinned.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
But on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were never republished.
Eatonville, along with much of the world, seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although once a popular writer, she was a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, buried in an unmarked grave at Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
There were no significant commemorations or large, public readings at Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in a Rainbow," a 2003 biography of Hurston.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of Kennedy Avenue, the two-lane main street, which played an important role in the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated with the Interstate 4 highway connecting the states on the city's western border.
The proposal came while Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in history.
Among other things, forced integration put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, racial mixing struggles gave the community a taste of hatred.
"At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died from this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to impose forced integration. He said in "Brown v. Board of Education" to "insult rather than respect my race."
Today, residents say that while school desegregation has been positive in some respects, it has weakened Eatonville cohesion and undermined youth confidence.
"Black kids were used to hugging them — I remember that — hugging your teacher morning and night," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Community of Eatonville, a nonprofit organization.
"This lasted as long as students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean, there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
But human rights helped rise many other Zora Neale Hurston — black writers, actors, and artists who rose above prejudice, as she did, with optimistic confidence and lines like, "How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company!
It's incomprehensible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to restore her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston, written by Robert E. Hemenway, hit bookstore shelves and once again elevated him to America's role models.
The road construction project was about to start just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main thoroughfare.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the celebration every January since.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
"With the five-lane widening of the main road, the community has revived and gone into full gear, which is a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city's image of itself.
Increasing numbers of people living outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began attending church in 1993, began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Records in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on the repaved and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cuckoo egg: it's less than ten miles from central Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; It is as small as it was when it was founded in the 1880s by 27 black families.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
Outsiders who arrive here looking for Eatonville's story and message are still greeted with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things — like Eatonville's oldest fresco painted by a white man depicting blacks working in the fields — should not be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville — including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly drawn to bright red — fear their distinct community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, so did the pride of the hometown.
Young people in particular increasingly see Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with all its problems and everything, no better or worse, as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and confused as the other racial and ethnic groups in America.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, plans to return after college to work for local government or police that he believes need help.
And younger people seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, like 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just pass through here think that this city is nothing compared to the others," Alondra Kenon said recently after the service on a Sunday.
"But if you stop and take some time to learn about its history, it's a very beautiful city."
We in New York all speak the language of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstands and huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and venture fund managers who control New York are going through their toughest days since 1929.
Couriers are still rattling their metal teacarts along the sidewalks, delivering trays full of muffins to morning meetings.
Hispanic men are still shuffling between the blockhouses, carrying fifty-something ironed shirts like human mules, hanging from a yoke-like noose draped over their shoulders.
Office workers are still queuing up for their sweet pastries in the morning at food trucks standing on the sidewalk, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I didn't feel there was any crisis until I decided to open a new bank account on Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news.
Although I had deliberately planned to do things during the afternoon calm at the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, there were already about 20 people in line in front of me.
Not at the cashier's window, where money can be withdrawn or deposited, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me, I later learned from Starr, the banker "assigned to me", lined up with the same intentions as me.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their neighborhoods, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
Money has been taken out of so-called savings banks (which are something like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate only in one state and supposedly treat their customers like family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks quietly went bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has gone into receivership, and when New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bailout buyout with $440 billion in savings.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, the bank that does most of the capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at a local Chinese department store talked over her phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its big-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed fifties caretaker on my apartment block, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment as usual.
He said to me after I was at the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I switched, I don't take any chances."
Memorable Life Trips: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of the Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, Sept. 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 could have been included in the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shapeshifter) was consistent with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music presented to it - be it a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or accompanied by orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we owed it to a man whose inspiration has inspired our enthusiasm for music to remain unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "Let the music sound on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
Everything is in the sheet music.
So sing it!"
His conducting technique has always been perfectly understandable and precise, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the musical standard, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If ever there was a conductor who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty-something years, I have written reviews of more than 100 of his concerts, but he never disappointed me with any of them, and I was often thrilled with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "galloped around the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff obituary (September 25), "In 1946 he continued his studies of economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholar of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while constantly preparing for bachelor's, master's and PhD."
This is taken from the author's notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it is erroneous.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry under the guidance of Professor J. D. Chambers, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
He actually stayed in the USA in 1950-51 on a Houblon-Norman fellowship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It's unclear why Woodruff embellished this period of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang attended a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to introduce the organization "Cities Against the Rise of Islam".
They marched with signs mimicking traffic signs depicting mosques crossed out with red lines.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria on the same weekend as far-right parties made significant gains in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were heavily vandalized at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday evening and this morning. According to police, it was an organized operation.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but investigators say they were trying to hide their extremist motives stemming from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the desecration of the tomb shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting an examination of conscience following yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the political balance has tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, the Party for Freedom and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strongly anti-immigration law and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18% of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, as well as displeasure with food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party's final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" that would help prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that resulted in victory for the far right show that the change was due to a largely young voter base concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child rape, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain by a court.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after he notified the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after presenting evidence to the court of child rape convictions against Glitter.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the trial of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police filed a petition with Ashford Magistrates Court to block Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not show up in person."
Glitter, 64, notified authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is required to do so by law on sex offenders' registers.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If he fails to notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent police said they did not want to talk about Glitter's individual cases within County and his possible whereabouts.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children inside the country and abroad.
"We think it's easier to control someone if they don't leave the UK, because we have a comprehensive system in place to manage potential risks more effectively.
"Kent Police considers protecting the people of Kent to be their top priority. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the conduct of individuals on the sex offender register and living in the county to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to transfer to a plane bound for London.
However, he claimed to feel unwell and refused to fly to London.
Thailand's authorities refused to let him pass passport control, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Court in west London to be placed on the sex offenders' register under a court order as requested by Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting the rape of children.
According to an Interior Ministry source, Assistant Secretary of State for Home Affairs Jacqui Smith was relieved and pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take the photos on stage, because I want to show the artist from a personal point of view" Günther Bauer photographer
No sets, no ruffles, no dancing shoes.
The grandmasters of flamenco up close, without the excitement of performing: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary person.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments away from the audience, when we can catch a personal movement, capture the depth of a caught gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of an artist who is not preparing to perform on stage.
In his photo series Flamenco-people, German artist Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of masters.
Through the photos, flamenco presents its specific iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco day by day", says the artist, adding that Flamenco-people "could be anyone, because seeing the pictures makes the observer realize that these images do not represent artists in a typical way.
These people shot on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
Stage photography, on the other hand, is not suitable for capturing their personalities.
Their personality and character dwell at the very core of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personalities of flamenco greats with the help of the camera."
With the impetus of the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on his long journey in 1997, during which he used a disc camera to create portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers.
Thanks to the camera and the choice of subjects, these portraits evoke classical photography.
However, the use of various stylistic means breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. The following idea reflects Bauer's vision of flamenco: "This is music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always fascinating."
It is not the dance, nor the singing or the music per se, but rather the personality and character of the artist that enchants the audience.
The leitmotif of the works on display in the El Fotomata gallery today is the search for an encounter with the essential, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, being and representation.
The names of well-known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are the hallmarks of this collection of photographs featuring almost sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, about which an album of portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the series "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like photographing people, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portraiture.
You meet people, you meet personalities you sometimes don't even know, or who only spend a few minutes on photography.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.
The Flamenco-people exhibition of contemporary flamenco portraits is on display at the El Fotomata Gallery at calle de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until October 16.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he is working on is "complete audacity."
The location and plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel. The protagonist of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who lived in Congo for twenty years and also visited the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner for literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work was "complete audacity" and that "all indications are that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and I hope to make it happen at some point," he concluded his speech at the festival of exchanges, ideas and opinions that welcomed hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors to the city of Aqueduct for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he lived up to his expectations.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel Our Mutual Friend. His performance filled the Juan Bravo theater.
After Felix Romeo's welcome speech, he was greeted by a devoted audience. The hour quickly flew by for the public, during which the Peruvian writer, with amazing memory and a great dose of humour, recounted how his profession as a writer developed from the extraordinary adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how to bridge the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, lots of corrections and rewrites; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing career, and what memories his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added that "I don't think literature is mere entertainment or a flourishing experience" because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to take responsibility for their profession.
Due to inclement weather, the farewell to Pozoblanco is shorter, horse bullfights are also cancelled
The horse bullfight, traditionally held as the culmination of the Pozoblanco celebrations, was cancelled yesterday morning after prospective equestrian gymnasts found the arena unsuitable for the competition.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided not to hold the bullfight.
Weather conditions severely disrupted the festivities, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was cancelled due to rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought the bulls of Castilblanco.
Thus, a bullfight was held only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around shoulder-to-shoulder.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won numerous accolades and one ear as a trophy through his two bulls, but this was due more to the audience than to his own performance.
But then came El Juli, who made little contribution to the reputation of Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get out of their flow.
In Alawa, a van carrying two tonnes of hashish tried to escape road checks
Four hours and fifty minutes in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police carries out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities stop a van in which two people are traveling. Passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was unobtrusive.
Investigators chased the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government's Internal Affairs Department said.
The arrested man is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where employees of the Traffic Authority of Álava carried out traffic checks on the N-1 highway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
Investigators gave chase and the vehicle stopped on the emergency lane a few kilometres away and its occupants fled from the highway towards a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually apprehended one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily branded van, seized its shipment, 2178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish bales that filled the rear of the vehicle were removed by police to undergo a closer examination and measure of the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proved that the vehicle's fake license plate did not match the data contained in the van's papers, and therefore the arrested person will also be prosecuted for falsifying public documents.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing its investigation, aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the highway and determining the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was taken to the police station for the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, court action began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested over the weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
According to an eyewitness, he made strange maneuvers to leave the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Traffic Patrol told People magazine.
According to the witness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pushed the gas to the floor, roared the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forward and backward, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
A short time later, a witness, who probably did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called police because he was "worried for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed traffic on the highway.
He "looked confused," so patrol officers took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
A police spokesman said the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately. The spokesperson also said officers believed Locklear was under the influence of medication based on officers' first impressions.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified substance. Around 7 p.m., he was taken to the local jail, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago where his anxiety and depression were being treated.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the unit will decide on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit family members.
"I am largely federalist in these matters, and this matter certainly falls within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out of the party's approach to the former member of Seville's city council.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed that "transparency" should be kept in mind when investigating any irregularities committed by Silva: "At IU has always advocated maximum transparency in cases of this kind."
He added that part of the trainings is "a strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May Blood", Garci's epic creation
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes, José Luis Garci evokes the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish people in May Blood, which, with a budget of nearly €15 million, is the largest film in his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flow of people and social analysis that he always admired in his work by the well-known novelist. Garci told a large audience of actors at the film premiere today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May Blood will be released in cinemas on Friday and will later be screened by Telemadrid as a miniseries lasting more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, realized his childhood dream with this shooting. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the offer on the condition that the story be based on National Episodes.
The budget of 15 million euros was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and presented Garci with a unique opportunity: to showcase with period scenery and costumes "the confused Spaniards who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, since the struggle for independence had plunged the country into great backwardness. With the reign of Ferdinand," he said.
Still, the director regretted not being able to count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's Phantoms, which more than doubled the budget of May Blood. Because of this, he was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is co-written with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of Starting Over resorted to his usual way of working, shooting scenes with the actors with whom he had already begun rehearsals before filming. There was no casting because Garci finds it "humiliating" and because, he said, "part of directing is going to the theater and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we work in."
This is not the first time that several actors from The May Blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga and Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have stepped in front of their cameras.
Garci — who has four Oscar nominations and one Oscar — believes that none of this year's nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy — May Blood, Seven French Pool Table and Blind Sunflowers — represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is what it should show," he said.
Garci is not expecting awards with this film.
"Initially, you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that all you care about is getting along, and finally you're happy to make another film," says Garci, who has almost 30 years of professional career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville pays tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Born to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in oriental dances.
During her busy life, she was a pioneer in women's equality, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that impede women's freedom of movement.
She sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in wartime Europe, and her life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, from the "dance of the butterfly" to guajira, or from the "dance of the snake" to tango.
"She danced sensually and others think that's my style," she says.
The highlight of the performance is enhanced by two extraordinary collaborators: Miguel Poveda, after Open Door, now sings again in Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the elder Tortola, a mature woman.
I'm happy that he said yes to the invitation, I'm very honored that he's performing in my piece."
In addition, the production features music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pájaro is a percussionist, Rafa El Viola is a violist, and Juanfra Juárez is an actor who "plays the constant character who constantly besieges the real diva with her love."
The play also largely depicts the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels around Europe, reaching distant lands at the time, such as India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great influence on his own time, but today his work is not known or even much appreciated," says Bayón.
The performance kicks off tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are fascinating.
The simplicity and power that emanated from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photographs, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is imbued with emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
At the end of the Triennium, "Diary of a newly married poet" also appears
The first illustrated edition of Diary of a Newly Married Poet will premiere at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The premiere is part of a series of events entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organised by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the deaths of both of them.
In this way, the closing chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the republication of said work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the memorial house of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Bright Poplar". The exhibition opened in May this year, toured several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Commission of the Andalusian Regional Government acquired a total of eight hundred copies of Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, in order to promote the fame and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on Victims of Sensation, reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman's death caused in American cinema and throughout America.
How hard it was for him to get the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
and was known to be ill,
But even so, everyone was shaken by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put into words our feelings, and now I've lost a good friend," Robert Redford said through tears, "his existence has improved my life and this country for the better."
No one was afraid that he might be ridiculed or overdone.
One of the heroes of cinema and homeland passed through a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-esteem and a desperate search for dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people left to look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In people's eyes, she truly embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and justice.
He was Richard Nixon's formal enemy and defender of lost and won causes, from setting up an anti-drug foundation in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to creating his homemade organic food brand.
It was a veritable gift to a country that struggled to overcome its suicidal food culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration spread throughout Hollywood regardless of nationality or race.
According to the last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, not one man, but an era died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said his work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today attempts to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: they demand honesty and serious and off-camera privacy.
This is not always easy, if at all possible in today's media jungle.
Yet there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He was divorced once, but then lived fifty years in a faithful marriage to Joanne Woodward, even though he would certainly have had many occasions for infidelity.
"Why should I eat hamburgers elsewhere when roast meat is waiting at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that on earth your daughters are also your fans, which is not very common in America.
"Of all his performances, none was he more proud of than the faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted philanthropist," they say.
The bumpy road of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of the Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it could become 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think at all.
They called it a perfect race, but in my view it was the worst of all I've ever been to.
It was riddled with nonsense, and if it had to be evaluated once and I was the examiner, it would definitely be a failure.
But let's go one by one and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the adoption of the serial number, because it was necessary to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid queuing later).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first, only the serial number was handed over (first nonsense, just so I got there sooner) and (after the usual queue), how surprising, it was only an S T-shirt (second nonsense, since I have exactly size XL)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save on material and buy only cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go there terribly early to pick up the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from arrival, and you even had to hand in your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race has started and we haven't dropped off the backpack yet. When we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, interspersed with popular uprising and stand-attack attempts, even more pleasant.
I think by tomorrow about 500 of us will definitely get pneumonia, and some, myself included, won't get our rankings by our actual time. I assume that my chip recorded the launch incorrectly.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, of course I wouldn't think of it.
So I think we can continue dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At MIT's Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent - that, however, is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, you can call a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle on your company's premises) based on the information you hear from the conversation.
This "receptionist" uses a camera and a shape and facial recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even remember what clothes they are wearing - and to hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those present based on conversations.
In the introductory video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but knows that she does not belong to the company talking to her and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit anyone and assures him that he will come to his aid soon.
All this without the blue big screen.
Enthralling.
But this, of course, is the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many have been rumored that Microsoft is changing strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and include fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran only the necessary programs instead of a lot of commercial garbage, then the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's already something.
They invented the wheel, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction pays off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly being pushed into the background, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome hit the web, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step toward competing with Windows.
Many have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an indispensable element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
She plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to reckon with the "death" of the operating system, not in absolute, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on our computers just to open Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and we spend more and more time browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
So what are most of the applications that come with the system for?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less busy, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services online instead and ultimately provide an alternative to Google.
They really need all this, and I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
A poster on the soda machine tells them to use the company's browser. - "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
By the way, last week the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced.
It will arrive not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will likely try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones increasingly function as computers.
But the slippage, considering Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, and it is also one of the standard outfits of the well-kneaded gay public.
And speaking of specialties, we can even recall the peacetime figure of the travelling circus weightlifter with a cocky moustache.
But what are we talking about? It is about none other than the men's cotton jersey, which is typically tight and mittenless.
That is, the "tank", as the Anglo-speakers call it, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles cannot compete with any of its competitors.
First of all, because of his elegant name, although he is known among friends as "Marcel", which he owes to sports, as legend has it that he was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel stands out from its competitors due to its excellent cotton material, unisex cut, distinctive emblem and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck area of the shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen trousers, navy shirts, baby clothes, mini-shorts - and the list goes on - are all products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
although it is also unfortunate that they have to be worn as undergarments.
They're too good for that.
Second Honda sales record
In November, Honda will begin selling the second-generation Jazz.
True, its predecessor already had quite a large cabin, but the interior design of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus reevolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before moving on to the detailed description of the new model, we must say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less well known in Europe, it is breaking sales records in other markets.
One such market is Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car brand in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly one million copies of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million units sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazzs, by 2009 it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazzs since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
For the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units in one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate Honda's drop in sales in Spain.
The company forecasts 22,000 units sold by the end of this year, 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose from 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
By 2010, they also want to increase this percentage to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size of 4370 mm long, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide annually.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's market share would be in the United States, while the rest would be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height, on the other hand, remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to dimensions, the cabin has also become more spacious.
The larger interior space is guaranteed both by the new body and by the fuel tank in the middle - a solution already familiar from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double-floor trunk has been increased and now stands at 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first generation.
However, these dimensions refer to the model with a 1.4 litre engine, as the trunk of the 1.2 Honda Jazz holds 379 litres.
Some exterior modifications can also be discovered, such as the LED rear lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seat doors has been increased to 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees for the front Jazz.
The engines of the second-generation Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model is available with two power units of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both engines consume better fuel than the previous model, lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while delivering outstanding performance in every respect.
The power of the 1.2-liter engine is 90 hp at 6000 rpm and maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine - which produced 78 hp in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 litres and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 hp in the previous generation, now reaches 100 hp.
The 100 hp 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and emits 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mom; It doesn't matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means much more than just some pretty and beautiful girls putting their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of the new headquarters of the company Mango in Paris, as well as at the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It exudes a captivating warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango's new autumn-winter collection, designed with my sister Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second competition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and at the gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
It's quite a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get your inspiration for the new collection?
We both love 50s and 60s cinema; We took over a lot of things from there.
And then, a lot of times, I just go around town and watch women dress, how they mix and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. You're a versatile woman, right?
I think so, too, but at the end of the day, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes from an early age, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's house and rummage through my aunt's wardrobes.
Well, that was Canaan, almost like an amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dressed.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals to have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is interconnected, and I have all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday. Haven't you fallen into lethargy?
Oh no!
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think that's when women really mature, they're experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Since childhood, I have been doing what I feel like doing, and it fills me with great inner happiness.
And would you like to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because that's what I was born to do as a woman, and I want to be a young mom, I definitely don't want to miss that.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about cinema. Last year you made several films that haven't even been released.
Yes, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I can't wait to present The Last Hour and The Search for the Tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you guys think...
As far as I know, you made your catwalk debut a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true...
I didn't go up the catwalk as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organisation Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes on display were auctioned off and the proceeds were donated to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
So much is being said about him, so I know him, and I can assure you that half of it is not true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of what he does.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I would do that too.
When it comes to the fate of women in the Third World, I know nothing impossible.
The collision avoidance "bee car"
To develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan drew inspiration from nature, specifically the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center in collaboration with the prestigious University of Tokyo's Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Brand Director of Technology PR and R&D, defines the BR23C as an extension of Nissan's four-level safety shield.
The robot completes the collision avoidance capability of the company's products.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
However, much more important is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. As a result, the uterus can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of the compound eye, engineers designed a so-called laser rangefinder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles within a distance of up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
"As soon as an obstacle is detected, the small robot mimics the movements of the uterus and immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a greater or lesser angle to avoid a collision.
The main difference between the system and currently available instruments is that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre takes place completely automatically.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the detour cannot be directed upwards or downwards, nor diagonally, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of turning the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in the manner that happens in the case of bees.
That's why, in addition to accelerating and decelerating, Nissan has also used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There's no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work uninterrupted with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but we are really not talking about gigabytes, or even megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could be in production cars within ten years.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be another application to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Repeat drunk drivers will be required to install "Alcolock"
After three drink-driving offences, the Ministry of Interior would require motorists to install a device that would prevent them from starting the vehicle if the driver is intoxicated or does not blow into the device.
The proposal was tabled in June and is now being considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office, which says the pilot project will last for a year.
As the aim of the project is to bring it back into circulation, the driver will also have to attend a repetition course on traffic education.
In addition to the Road Safety Prosecutor's Office, the Directorate General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of motorists who have been arrested several times for drink-driving get back into the car.
Alcolock would prevent this, as a system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level in the air blown into it. If it is larger than allowed, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument worth more than €1,000 would be borne by the offender.
A relevant study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these instruments can reduce offences by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: firstly, it makes it easier to prevent them from degenerating into criminal offences;
On the other hand, it is simpler to implement, since the legal reform is carried out in the usual way, whereas the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment to the Fundamental Law.
The instrument is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has been installed in experimental mode in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Chamber of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to install the system in school buses, following the French model.
In Mexico, wearing closed shoes
The Spanish Air Force Princely Party transport plane landed in the presidential Hangar of Mexico City's Benito Juárez Airport at 5:40 p.m.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only use our hands as visors to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princely Couple was coming to town for an official visit.
- Great, then there won't be an airport shuttle for quite some time today... The woman is from here or something...
"No, no sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
-Oh, or so...
But the Mexican press knows all about the Ducal couple of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many people wait at the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon of 27 marines who protect dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling in a sea-blue dress, and then the Princess, her long hair catching the wind, dressed modestly, but not in the usual toe-flashing shoes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They pause for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the hall where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel, one of the city's four largest hotels, a mouthpiece reporter on Mexican television awaits them.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of investable cash, is not lacking in common sense.
With the crisis upon them and Americans not getting entangled in the maze of mortgage banks of questionable solvency, they created an entertaining and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Hotel of bad credits"... that is, of the galibas.
The gloomy look of the accommodation, and especially of the receptionist, suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really time to borrow money.
And especially where to apply for a loan, since that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on this website is indeed useful, but it is not detailed.
It is aimed at teenagers rather than the general public.
But what would happen if we added to the game?
For example, the hotel would show the room of our dreams.
Actually, it is something, because we do not dare to dream about buying a home...
Most Valuable Fashion Award
The best place in the world to present a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of all fashion designers alive today is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to introduce young talents of the fashion industry internationally.
The grand prize is €300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her self-designed clothes in the shop window of Mango at 54 Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and recently opened on an area of 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of so many events and thanks to Valentino for chairing the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango for the gala dinner looked even more spectacular.
Nati, who left with a heavy heart and sadness due to the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking ornaments of ELAH. Together with his son Luis, who is nearly two meters tall, he accompanied Valentine to the main table of the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained guests. He and Baron Rotchil were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, as they each gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store wearing trousers and a shirt of her own design, and to dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During his nightly visit to the opera in the company of Gaya Toledo, he was so enthusiastic in the ballet hall that, reminiscent of the old days, he swooped up to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but before that she showed some photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of Oliver Martinez - he is also almost two meters tall and rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels and told me well in advance that he would not ask for any perfume in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress relieving number
Not 1000, but 1000 and there is one way to disconnect from chaotic and chaotic everyday life.
Another piece of good news is that you can find them all in one book that arrives in bookstores on September 30 to bring peace of mind.
The clock ringing at 7 a.m. is almost excruciating, but it's even worse to think about how fast-paced today's world forces you to live every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is an endemic disease of the twenty-first century.
But there are not one nor two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and overcome problems at work.
No, that number equals 1,001 to be exact.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that suits them best and can be adapted to their free moments.
The stress-relieving work is called 1001 Relaxation Methods, and the calmness that emanates from it comes to bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this handbook is sure to shake your faith.
It also offers other ideas to help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central concern in your life, it's time to sit back in your armchair, relax and concentrate on reading.
Those who speak in dreams
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and are fully aware of what happened to them that day, but those who speak while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but in reality it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, mainly among children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of them have been told that he spoke at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rhapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a disease with a high fever) or more regular (daily, weekly or once a month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often combined with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night awakenings, bedwetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not the rule either.
As already mentioned, it can be a condition accompanied by a high fever, or even a state of stress or heightened excitement.
In any case, little studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, composed of incoherent words or murmurs, but unlike all this, it can also take the form of shouting, crying or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem causing great anxiety in the background and thus offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is benign and therefore has no cure unless it is accompanied by another treatable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things you can do, here are a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure that the child remains calm before bedtime.
Choose soothing toys and avoid your child watching fearful or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or have difficulty relaxing, we teach some relaxation methods to help them find inner calm.
This will help your child sleep more soundly.
If he does start talking while he sleeps, try to keep calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be useless because the child is unconscious, but it would throw him out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by intense anxiety several times, it is recommended to consult a specialist or find out what triggers the high level of anxiety in the child.
If he speaks clearly (this is the rarer case), don't start asking him questions to find out anything from him.
It would be superfluous anyway, since during sleep you are not so conscious as to collect your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with your interpretation of what you hear and any conclusions you may have.
Never tell your child that you can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even as a joke.
This provokes a very high level of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, since it is only a harmless episode of a few minutes.
Finally straight on the Illhaeuser
After a long dip, the Illhaeusern team finally gained new momentum and secured victory again on home soil.
Although it was not a thrilling game, the yellow and black team found themselves in situations several times, taking advantage of one of which they were ultimately able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers struggled to get into the right rhythm.
The first shot on goal was attempted by the away captain, Kauffmann, but the long-range ball just touched the top corner of the goalpost. Then Illhaeuser had the upper hand and shots followed one after another: Fonderflick attempted a shot from distance and then Hirn's shot flew over the goal. Romain spitted and Diebold also tried to shake Dannemarie's defence with a long-range attempt.
On the other side, the players defended in midfield in a block, and only the perpetual motion Riahi got into a shooting position.
The start of the second half promised to be decisive: first Riahi and Temporale got into position on the Dannemarie side. Immediately afterwards, the first goal was scored: the ball bouncing off Diebold's first shot was picked up by the Illhaeuserni Marais with excellent positioning and sent into the goal (53rd minute).
However, the Illhausern goalscorer could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the pitch, so his teammates had to continue the fight with a man down.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little to strengthen their defence. Only the final seconds contained some excitement when, after much haste, the ball came very close to the goalpost.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralyzed traffic in several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to receive the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with a meeting of the 'crisis committee', set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in diesel prices, which have exceeded the record average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the president, said he would "discuss with fishermen solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers."
Fishermen are eagerly awaiting Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, traffic-slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing congestion nearly 10 km long.
Traffic to Quiberon's marina was also paralyzed, but roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
Roadblocks have been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination. At dawn, tyres and pallets were set on fire outside fuel depots in the ports of Brest, while demonstrations also took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
Further demonstrations followed in other ports on the Atlantic coast and in the English Channel. In Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen did not board boats, while in Le Havre about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant vessels.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique department lifted their blockade of the huge Total oil refinery in Donges in the evening.
Fishermen in Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting of the ministry to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday its next step and participation in a planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Commission, as the committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "fishermen will not give in to their demands" and "refuse to travel to Paris", Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient fisheries commission, announced, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay tax on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the only way to make a boat profitable is to reduce the price of diesel below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have paid tribute to cinema legend Paul Newman, who has died aged 83 and is dedicated to his profession.
Embraer Will Not Change Its 2008 Delivery Plans
Despite the crisis threatening the global economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping to plan to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, company president Fredrico Fleury Curado has confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is counting heavily on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120 seater aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, an insurance firm revived by U.S. financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay $85 billion it has been advanced, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its internationally advanced life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would divest most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the matter.
According to the Times, AIG's board of directors met Sunday evening to examine the potential for the sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
AIG's assets to be sold include the company's aircraft leasing firm International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times added.
However, according to the newspaper, no final decision has yet been made on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly obtain liquid assets to repay an $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government. By doing so, you run the risk of divesting up to 80% of your capital and losing shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique study of the historic Morning Meeting meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell 6.98% (down nearly 800 points as an all-time high) and the Nasdaq fell 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) sank 777.68 points to close at 10,365.45 points.
The index's biggest decline to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq, which mainly relies on technology papers, closed down 199.61 points at 1,983.73, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index fell 8.81%, or 106.85 points, to 1,106.55 points, according to official close.
The Wall Street stock market was already weak at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank rescue plan aimed at restoring market balance, it plunged.
MEPs rejected by 228 votes to 205 to 205 the funds requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
The plan was voted down by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
"The market has gotten the wrong signal out of this, because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, expressing concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
"If the plan is really doomed ... then it will be up to the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis and lending conditions will tighten further," warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds that "with every day that passes, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities secured that Wachovia's banking businesses were acquired by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated sharply, necessitating emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is "experiencing a global crisis not only in the US," adds an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has picked up significantly.
The yield on the 10-year government bond fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, and the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.161% from 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the transfer of a stake in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Japan's largest bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's share price plummeted on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in convertible securities that will yield a 10% return at $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction will be executed using an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current price.
Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley's share price fell 6.79% around 5 p.m. GMT to close at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance presents a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company," said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which will allow it to diversify its operations while also coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from Wall Street-listed corporate giants.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought the stake would consist entirely of ordinary shares," explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and prevent potential risks."
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more for Morgan Stanley shares than book value.
As a result of the transaction, earnings per share will decrease by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year, if the trading price of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can be used to leverage your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, a spokesman for the group declined to provide precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG's merger, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency ratio by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved "definitely" since late August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its share price has halved and the cost of insuring it against default risk has skyrocketed.
This cost moderated on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
Among the large investment banks, only one "survivor" remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it has raised $15 billion, part of which comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
Rebuilding the republic in the spirit of twenty-first century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa on Sunday outlined his vision for a new constitution.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum, according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to it, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, and 0.7% were cast blank.
The draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote to pass.
On Sunday, two polls at polling office exits and a census conducted by an NGO both demonstrated the huge "yes" vote with 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke of the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won a landslide victory," he said, thanking Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, the governor's seat 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) monitoring mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text summarizing the principles of the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, reserving to the state the right to "plan development" for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign corporations and foreign currency sent by emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain a maximum of two consecutive terms and has the power to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this opportunity and will run again for the post of head of state in February 2009.
The constitution also included free health services and education. The president has already started implementing it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the subsistence level.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country. This could end Quito's and Washington's agreement on the use of a facility in Ecuador as a base for U.S. anti-drug measures.
Obama wins the first televised duel
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge victorious from the duel.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners claimed victory in a televised duel watched by one-third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen said that while John McCain's performance was respectable, it was not "impressive" enough to halt his decline in popularity, as evidenced by polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the race: polls released Saturday show Obama with a five-point lead over McCain (44% vs. 49%).
Among the most calculating, yet undecided voters, 39 percent said Obama would win, while 25 percent expected McCain to win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to extend his lead with a great performance by his party colleague Joseph Biden on Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton warned over the weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has a good intuition."
McCain, now in his seventies, never fails to highlight his own undeniably vast foreign policy experience. However, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivety" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," the attack was repeated repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," McCain said.
This is the main attack surface that has been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was focused and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does," a Democratic ad aired over the weekend retorted, accusing the Republican leader of still failing to assess the impact of the crisis on America's "street people."
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of twenty thousand people gathered in torrential rain in North Carolina for the voter meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, whom Americans see as best suited to save an economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could prove to be a turning point," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton administration veteran, said Obama had "economic instincts as excellent as Bill Clinton did during the 1998 financial crisis."
For the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite stock market fluctuations, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the possible establishment of the country's energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
But both presidential candidates have carefully dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank rescue plan, a highly unpopular plan passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition members demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the expected results of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square after polling stations closed to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although results have not yet been announced, many young people demonstrated against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: 'Dictator, resign!'.
Some admit that they didn't even vote: "Why would I have gone? They can do whatever they want with my vote anyway!" says one young person.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to present itself in a good light to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were deemed clean, observers could lift sanctions on the country, which have denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not go smoothly.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the twelve-party United Democratic Forces coalition, which is very heterogeneous.
"The changes were nominal," said Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "It's about who counts the votes, and in our case, that's the executive.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to get a place on television, meet in the regions of the country and introduce bills.
Therefore, the opposition must enter the political scene because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy, heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk falling under Russia's control.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that turnout appears too high and that the widespread organisation of early voting (in which 26% of voters in Minsk participated) has allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks Alexander Kozulin, a Social Democratic leader who was the last to be released from prison as a political prisoner in August this year.
No one was present at the polling stations.
And up to five opposition MPs will be elected to parliament, namely those who are best suited to the leadership.
October Square is once again covered in the silence of night.
And on television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission rejoice: they succeed.
19 hostages freed in Chad
Egyptian commandos raided the kidnappers, who had taken eleven tourists and their eight attendants hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed earlier this morning by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
They arrived by plane at around half-past four in the afternoon, apparently in good condition, to the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately taken to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area on the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers have been "not ransomed," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border between Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were on off-road safari. The group was then dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hostage-takers.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, which organizes the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived at the scene in two helicopters and ambushed the hostage-takers just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled," the leader, who asked not to be named, said.
He also said that a special detachment of 150 men had been sent from Egypt's Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where it was supplemented by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian diplomatic chief Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and Italian special task forces.
"We must admit that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and task forces," he said, without giving further details.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
The day before, the Sudanese military announced that it had intercepted an SUV on which the kidnappers were travelling while on patrol. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader) and two were arrested.
The army claimed the hostage-takers were affiliated with a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
The debate over the financing of culture is currently at the heart of newspaper reports and the ongoing election campaign.
We can only be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will speak out to highlight the ridiculous sums spent on small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historic sites on the verge of starvation?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and cultural heritage buildings?
Or that neither Quebec nor Canada have laws that actually ensure effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Château Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
And the constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, every elected representative, and every government agency.
More than 40,000 volunteers from 211 history, heritage, archives and genealogy societies work within the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec to research history and preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological finds on a minimal budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage tooth and nail, protesting with the last strength of the drowning when property developers and decision-makers point their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Safe blood again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec is now one of the safest and most efficient blood donor societies in the world.
Most importantly, it has managed to regain people's trust, which was severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general uproar, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation in February 1994 under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever. The aim was to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make recommendations to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Justice Krever delayed submitting his report, some provinces formed their own committees to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission fulfilled this function.
The Gélineau and Krover reports led to the establishment of two blood services in Canada: Héma-Québec, which serves Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, which is responsible for supplying all other provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec started in 1998, barely 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years that followed, however, we were able to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in this area." Décary is proud to say that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population trusted Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, several cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were detected in Europe when people were infected, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its foundation in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was transmitted through blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the key recommendations of the Krex and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain alteration and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, it was established beyond doubt that the disease is also transmitted through blood.
This incident convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can detect the virus itself directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies against the virus on which the previously used tests were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical devices, explains the expert.
They were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk of blood donors unknowingly infecting the blood stock and preventing it from being detected.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million in one.
"In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million blood products until someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think anyone can now accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what new pathogen will enter your system.
After all, it was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like West Nile virus, enters the blood through insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on our guard," Dr. Décary continued, stressing that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must ensure sufficient permanent reserves.
"As the population ages, so do demands.
As anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet replacement.
Population ageing also has an impact on blood donor populations, with the number of eligible blood donors in the network accounting for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any healthy person aged 18 years or over who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example. And those who have been to a country where malaria is ravaging are not eligible to donate blood for one year.
"With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare that we run out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors as the existing ones age, because after a while they will no longer be able to donate blood.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's fast-paced world, you barely have an hour to go and donate blood," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeball tissue and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then deposited at Hema-Québec, which also manages Quebec's only public stem cell bank.
Once treated only as medical waste, the umbilical cord can be used to extract blood that is rich in stem cells, making it possible to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the entry of the thousandth umbilical cord blood sample into our bank, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants," said Dr. Déchary, who said the cord blood collection program is very popular these days.
"Many mothers are sad that they can't do that," is true, as Hema-Quebec is unable to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - semi-finals of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifier and advanced to the semifinals with an aggregate score of 4:3. This was the second and crucial match of the quarter-finals, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The decisive goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went goalless, in the second the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque of the Sounders team was the only one to outplay goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Recall that in their first match on Friday, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat to Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will play the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder, who lost 3:1 to the Whitecaps in the first game, won 4:3, but still the Whitecaps advanced to the semifinals with an aggregate score of 5:4.
The Impact are expected to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but game details will be clarified later today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triad is prepared for another season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks and in the end the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers 3:2 from penalty shots last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored one goal. Plekanec finished the match with two assists and Kovalev with one, which was the fourth win in the team's six pre-season games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not prepared yet," warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel in shape."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He got a huge ovation."
Charest's Nordic aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that elections will begin later this year
As soon as the Liberal Party rally ended, Jean Charest travelled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is aiming to win today's by-election.
"Pushing back our last great northern border": this is the ambitious long-term goal set out by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president tried to concentrate on the essentials.
During his performance, sequences similar to "Moulin à images" were projected behind him.
Stunning footage followed each other on three giant screens: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are usually used during election periods.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to guarantee that the election would not begin as early as this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for Quebec's future, embodied in a "new economic area." This includes a labor treaty with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several planned treaties with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at the 49th parallel) has been frequently featured in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
But the head of state confined himself to explaining why he considered the North "a treasure trove full of enormous potential." However, he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few opportunities for development: primarily hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries catching up and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds are found," Charest listed.
This territory, which is "twice the size of France", "is the territory of our territory, Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us," the head of state reiterated, stressing that by doing so he wants to create a national founding myth.
He emphasized that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the planning work in Quebec, James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the giant map behind him.
The north, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed for itself, the prime minister said at the press conference.
"This is our historic position, which has been reaffirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same position on behalf of the government," he stated.
On the other hand, "we also need to rethink our perspective on the North in the light of climate change", the Prime Minister said, referring to the Northwest Passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the polar ice.
In the Prime Minister's opinion, in this new geopolitical environment, occupying the territory is an important task.
And what about the indigenous people of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The prime minister said the government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will benefit many people, especially young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the delegate of the Parti Québécois in Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty local communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, including Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources), has also become operational.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision will be created".
The North would otherwise be developed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematised and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of a weekend that began Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"Our party's politicians, including Godbou, founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, founder of the silent revolution and nationwide expansion of hydroelectric power, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also cited another - albeit conservative - work, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the plan for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, President Charest highlighted that commissioning is planned for 2012.
"Let this remain between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was met with loud applause.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, having taken on duties at the Federal Council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. This is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": in particular, the Liberal Party demands recognition of the "peculiar character of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of Canada's Radio and Telecommunications Council, and for those members to have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical about the main points of the Northern Plan.
Coastal Québécois leader Paulina Marois has recalled Northern Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not, "today we would be much further ahead", said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, whom she ran as a candidate in today's vote in Jean-Talon.
The opposition party ADQ supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"But we don't want it to be a charade," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Last summer, Vic Toews, a minister in the Harper cabinet (incidentally his "attorney general") dared to call Louise Arbour Canada's "disgrace."
To vilify a woman who has fought ceaselessly for justice and deserves all our admiration says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which has not single-handedly repatriated its own citizens from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is a government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes against which he was accused.
It is the only government which, despite Canada's signatory to the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions.
The only government that turns the justice department into a puppet show while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are all calling for Omar Khadr to be repatriated so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government is turning a blind eye to the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this yet, we are currently undergoing an insidious destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper keeps saying this word, which comes out of her mouth as an empty phrase.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the mercy of the leader of a government that has been in the minority until now (and what else can come after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see this government trampling underfoot the values to which our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, the shame is more like this - look elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Oratory
The September 17 issue of Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and CEO of Canada's Barrick Gold mine.
Following Orwellian's argument, Garver states that the world's largest gold producer has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a low-budget publishing company in an attempt to initiate a so-called "public debate."
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in defamation lawsuits, are based not on truth but on the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate by ruining anyone who has a position contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money defending and fighting in an unequal struggle where on the other side is an army of lawyers backed by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, the tactic often used is to ruin the defendant and reach a friendly settlement, which not only silences those who disagree, but even intimidates those who would try to revisit the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have expressed its views to the public instead.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this happens differently, in Canada the disputing parties usually do not hit each other with a stick, but speak their minds.
It would therefore have been enough for the mine to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust the public and is sweeping aside petitions and letters written in defense of Noir Canada's authors in one go.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate while at the same time ignoring the opinion of this public?
In the vice president's mind, the word probably only means well-paid lawyers, not the entire population of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus narrowed considerably.
In a democratic state, even those who disparage others have freedom of speech.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand—or doesn't want to understand—is that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are supported by the public primarily because they condemn the mine's harsh practices.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and pass judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized reasoning, not through a trial aimed at silencing what many would seek. (By the way, Barrick Gold recently wrote to Noir Canada's authors asking them to refrain from using the term "public debate.")
Beyond Garver's surreal arguments, Barrick Gold's conduct openly attacks the freedom of academic research and the search for truth that are the building blocks of any democratic society.
Taken as a whole, the procedure denies the right to cite authoritative sources and the right to debate facts and their interpretation, which underlie intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada it is only possible to study and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of today's world under the burden of litigation, who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that Noir Canada's authors apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have been able to handle disputes, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's ill-considered approach shows that, contrary to what he claims, he has no desire to engage in open debate.
This is a loss both for the university world and for the institution of public debate in Canada. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures to limit legal proceedings for such abusive purposes.
Wall Street rescue mission - Democrats and Republicans reached an agreement
The Bush administration and Congressional Republican and Democratic leaders finally reached agreement yesterday on an economic rescue operation, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, designed to curb the financial crisis that has raged on Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: better monitoring of implementation by MEPs; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of allocated public money; new provisions to maintain the number of houses seized for non-payment; the right of access to the salaries of managers of companies which have received assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Rep. Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative in the Bush administration.
"We did everything we could to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democratic congressman explained.
"The most important point is that if we don't do that, there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans," Republican Rep. Judd Gregg said.
The trial was accelerated in the final few hours on fears that another setback would hurt investor sentiment.
They gave themselves a deadline for agreement until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the talks late expressed willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed no satisfaction that the situation had escalated to the limit.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited himself with adding elements to the agreement, such as provisions on preserving home ownership or paying executives of state-aided companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people's irresponsibility, that is not very welcome.
These steps are necessary," he said on an American television program.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but hopefully so."
"From what I've broadly read, you can see that this is something that we all need to digest and move forward with.
The option to do nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would be used to buy dubious claims of American financial institutions and risky, unsaleable assets.
The plan follows a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of the property bubble. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (subprime mortgages), then spilled over into other debt (commercial) securities, and finally caused a freeze in liquid resources and turmoil in banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was defeated by a group of Republican lawmakers last week.
We seem to have broken this impasse since Democrats agreed to secure rather than buy up some of the "toxic" assets of struggling companies.
To satisfy all members of Congress, a provision was included in the plan that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion tranche would first be paid; This could be followed by another 100 billion if deemed necessary by the President.
The disbursement of the remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for the help, Washington will acquire a stake in subsidised companies, which will allow it to receive dividends from profits and sell them after the crisis subsides.
The federal government will have the option to delay the seizure of properties backed by mortgages affected by the plan. It may also set a maximum value for wages and severance payments to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's authors want the plan to be approved by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, statements opposed to the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It's very clear that Washington is not hearing your voice," Republican Scott Garrett, who sits on the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that benefits taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, the Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the "skeptic faction," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us asking Congress not to rush and to carefully examine which path to take," Sherman said yesterday.
It was at the same moment that Europe once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the nationalisation of part of the Fortis banking group worth €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg came after France's BNP Paribas announced it would not buy its bankrupt competitor after it lost €2 million (US$2.9 billion) to the US subprime crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not a waste of money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we gain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government appears poised to nationalise yet another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion US dollars).
Spain's Santander bank announced yesterday that it will acquire subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would thus become the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has sought to nationalise since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Acting Idol
Her beautiful azure eyes were considered by some to be her main trump card, others to her main weakness.
Has the American actor with a charming smile ever gotten rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
His shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent also left him far removed from the strident style that is at the heart of the real great monsters of the art world.
But what an enormous career he has had!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at age 83 Friday at his Connecticut estate. He was one of the last icons of the heyday of American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and who had long been his rival on screen. In his roles, he was more reserved and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
From the mixing of blood, often extraordinary children are derived.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German-Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He did not think too much about himself, which only increased his merits.
After all, he embodied a country with a passion for the ideal of a "self-made man" and a warrior broken in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at Actor's Studio in New York City, before exploding into theater, television, and soon after, cinema.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he also finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans as a racing driver. She was also considered a sex symbol, although she had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know what were the downsides of the life of this mysterious, aloof, dedicated actor who hated the glamour of show business. This will forever remain a mystery.
He was an honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked moviegoers: we can only see him in his big roles on the black screen of memories.
Reviewing his oeuvre, we see the seventh American art, cinema interspersed with constant changes for more than fifty years.
We remember the charming cowboy in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man estranged from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who he played in the Tennessee Williams adaptation of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
More recently (1990) we can remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in old age finds that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up There," he gave an unforgettable performance as Rocky Graziano, a criminal boxer with a turbulent life. This role, originally intended for James Dean and taken over after his death, launched Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film "The Big Bang", which won the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Spangler" (1961), he played a bitter, vengeful billiard player, and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money." For his performance in the latter, he received his only Oscar in 1987 from nine nominations.
Changing times, but always the same face: that was him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by the change of epochs.
He is best known to younger people from George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, the unconventional coach of a hockey team.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Big Leap Forward" in 1994.
The series ended with Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, where he made his last appearance as an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the big screen relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood for all its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it not without humor as a "living refutation of underplay": he thought his playing was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time just fell into his lap for film roles.
However, he played young and successful characters less often: he preferred to play characters living on the margins of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to portray with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a man who was truly shy and sensitive at heart.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), he drew a delicate portrait of a melancholic woman with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role.
The 1984 film "Harry and Son" is a film that radiates restraint and sadness and pays tribute to his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, countless admirers of Newman paid tribute to the actor. Devastated by grief, his close friend and longtime comrade Robert Redford (with whom he starred in "The Big Bang" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "His presence has changed my life and the world for the better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggles for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and his criticisms of Hollywood's excesses are overshadowed.
Many times we could see his image smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in his mouth, although he thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to his foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never rested on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession to the end.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father has always and always been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to have witnessed the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai's invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are charged with continued and commercial fraud and other offences, including forgery of documents, committed in a criminal organisation causing particularly significant damage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the awarded tender money was used for their own purposes, and the performance of tasks was often justified by false invoices.
State and local government funds – totalling some HUF 65 million – went partly into the coffers of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the awarded tender money was withdrawn on the basis of cost invoices that were not backed by real performance, and the associations never fulfilled the commitment undertaken.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in the names of which companies the invoice production should take place was decided, among others, on the Balaton Uplands boulevard to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to look like boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, based on which invoices were prepared to be submitted for applications from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest, among others.
Most of these were written by István Lados together with his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports necessary for receiving grants.
One of the highlights of Lados' "study trip" was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of ninety people of the Safe Point Association.
However, according to the company manager, so many people would not have fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation for a Better Future - later called United for the Third Millennium - was riddled with errors in form and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form fillers also went overboard when they indicated Pigal Kft., also engaged in hospitality, whose accounts did not even contain documents for a Better Future and Oops, according to the information provided to the prosecution.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown invoices, he immediately knew that these were fake documents.
"The stamp had our business name and VAT number in the wrong place."
He added that, in addition to formal reasons, it was also wrong that, according to the bill, they accommodated a hundred people, as they have a total of eleven rooms in which there are not so many seats.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant has long since ceased to operate.
The zealous invoice makers did not even investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked like only organizes trips abroad, so they stumbly marked Hungarian travel as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's invoice issuing practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel activities to countries outside the European Union were exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the VAT rate was also wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for a Better Future, as the company's service is not subject to the indicated 25 percent, but 15 percent VAT, and the hotel's employees only issued machine invoices, but the manufactured invoice was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" spoiled the invoice by designating road freight transport as a performed activity in the case of a company, which was not carried out by the company, which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, it was also due to formal differences - incorrect invoice format, not real stamp - that the invoices for the United for the Third Millennium Foundation, the XXI. Century Cultural Association and the Safe Point were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices were issued by them.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention either, for example, to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Association for Young Town ate there, which is why, as far as we know, the liquidator of the company denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously exhibited
Another group of issuers are those who knew they had to issue fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the United for the Third Millennium Foundation for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Larch Association with invoices worth roughly five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
There is no money transfer either, because the completed invoices were subsequently cancelled, but the organizations forgot to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that can be linked to the accused.
Thus, the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based company dealing with fuel and motor vehicle trading, although not located there, was Iván Kubatov.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment in the value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man to whom Ivan Kubatov was also going to forward documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the Ltd. to Atlas, Hoppa and the United for the Third Millennium Foundation, and that he had taken their consideration.
It was specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, neither company actually operated, which, according to the defendant, was due to the fact that they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, he benefited from the businesses because, at the request of his co-defendant, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared the documents for company formations, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Millennials.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor's office believed that 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT hit Kubatov's mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were produced for the tender of Sure Point.
In January 2006, Millennials and the Alliance for a Modern Hungary submitted an application to the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA), a non-profit organization of the Socialist Party.
They won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid finding out, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the process of invoice production.
What may be most interesting is if the first defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak comprehensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest to do so, or whether the socialists made a deal with him in exchange for reimbursement of most of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
Who, by the way, may have been offended by now, as his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, constantly fell on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not compensate for it are free to walk around or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, they are not able to do so.
The psychology of overbidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological-economic basis of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been uncovered by neurologist and economist researchers at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to lose out in a type of competition like an eBay auction, so they tend to pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the neurological schema of this "game" with the help of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery and the other group participated in a playful auction while using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the active brain regions of the subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, in which the main element is to outbid the other party, the subcortical complex called striatum was activated intensively when the game was lost.
This brain region plays a role in the nervous system's "self-rewarding" mechanism, among other functions.
Therefore, according to researchers, the whipping up of the price can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economics members of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In it, three groups bid against a partner under various circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they placed their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they emerged victorious, they would receive an additional $15 in money.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but the members of the group also lost this money in the event of a losing auction.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was that for one of them they emphasized winning and for the other they emphasized losing.
However, proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the team members who played "against losing" were willing to bet even higher than the control and "winning" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena at auction with the joy of victory and risk aversion.
Only neurological imaging has helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so we now arrive at a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis in Hungary is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The term hepatitis is a collective term for infectious diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, hepatitis and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. through contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travelers should definitely protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After this, visible jaundice develops on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stools are light, the urine becomes dark in color, healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people die worldwide each year from liver cancer and cirrhosis of hepatitis B, the more serious type of disease.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
Three groups have significantly higher than average rates of such cases: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
There are currently an estimated 200 million people worldwide infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth contacting the general practitioner when detecting any symptoms of unknown origin.
With timely detection, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, first celebrated in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first European to be in trouble due to the spillover effect of the US credit market crisis, with partial nationalisation: the three countries are supporting the money and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments discussed the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been rippling through waves for more than a year, and the bank's decisions can therefore be considered precedents in some respects.
Under the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will buy nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank is likely to sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities it bought last year from ABN Amro in the Netherlands, mainly in insurance.
Fortis shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week the institute was already experiencing serious crisis phenomena.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow it to fail.
The company's stock plunged about 12% to a 14-year low on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the group's total market capitalisation is around €14 billion, but CEOs say this is unrealistic.
Management blamed overseas market uncertainties over the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall in Fortis stock.
On Monday, the papers were already slightly rising.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a meaningful offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors should not worry and lose their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank's clients, branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does believing in God hurt less?
According to recent research, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to see how belief in God affects people's perception of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In a bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were electroshocked while they were all studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to block out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that scans the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain control.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Specifically, the study involved attaching a sparkling device to the subject's left hand to deliver the ECT.
The researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with Hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The study hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 ECTs in four consecutive episodes while looking at either the religious picture or the general picture.
Catholics reported seeing the Virgin Mary and feeling "safe" as someone who was "cared for" and "calmed down and peaceful."
When they looked at the religiously themed picture, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo's artwork in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, just by finding the right photo.
"We should find an image of someone who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"Practicing faith should, and in many cases, change our personalities," Wright added.
After all these great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of his caliber showed believers a picture of one of the Madonnas, what effect would it have on their pain control?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you: it's in people's pockets as much as it is in the sky above their heads; He knows where they vacationed, what clinics they go to and what interests them.
That's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top executives.
As for skeptics who draw parallels with Orwellian nightmare, they miss the point of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, which is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google's founders: "let's systematize all the information in the world."
According to the Google CEO interviewed, the company is still at the beginning of managing all the information after ten years of world-changing work.
When asked what would happen five years from now, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what job would really suit me?" — but software can't answer such seemingly simple questions until they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms are recorded accurately during internet searches, from which IP address they were searched and what page the interested parties left after the search.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, will allow users to store their own surfing history, see what they searched for and clicked on, and generate more personalized results for them in the long run – the same logic that will be used to recommend products and services to us based on preferences we have previously told and recorded.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I do? - ask users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the company that can be frightening, rather than guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power that trigger the backlash of Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched terms are not only recorded, but may also be transferred to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
Perhaps the most vocal example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identifying information about paedophiles from Orkut, a social network maintained by it.
Internet users concerned about privacy could sigh back in May when the company, together with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its case in court against the FBI: Google cannot be forced by any provision of the Constitution to disclose any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get some fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms for citing the strengthening of the child protection law passed years earlier, but failed to obtain search lists for unique users or a complete list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
Google's perception is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear giving away their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy will be curtailed by using Google's services and rebelling against them by multinationals with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries sees them as the next generation of big corporations, the "cool corporation," unlike its rival Microsoft, which has been recognized as a world conqueror because of Windows, no matter how much both fight for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for an identification code, does not charge for its applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package seem much more accessible, youthful and cooler than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it may also be because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been implied by one of the most frequently used keywords of recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about deliberately leaving traces behind and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these varies from person to person, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can maintain profiles on several social media sites, from Facebook to Xanga, connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm, which lists their music habits, and connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and run a blog that automatically displays their latest photo galleries hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
While there are many exemplary cases that reveal that a girlfriend can easily find out who her fraudulent friend spent the evening with after seeing a flood of photos from her mutual circle of friends, or fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion about senior management on her blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of privacy has completely revalued by now.
Those who live online live what they show themselves, which is how we can formulate the basic premise behind the behavior of today's young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least want to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google's search system but at the same time deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, the number of people who deliberately do not register on social networks so that they cannot be found is not small, Google's online applications, from word processors to image managers and news readers, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile we have ever had.
The public is not so secretly waiting for Google to show off the whites of its teeth.
At $156 billion, the company is worth $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens ad agency revenues, and the accelerated adoption of services is causing major headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers will also find counterpoints that seem disturbing: for example, top management completely rejected employees' protests after doubling the fee for the corporate kindergarten, the management found it too costly to feed employees arbitrarily many times a day, but all this is dwarfed by the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government back in 2006 and according to their agreement, the company will filter out all results,  which harms good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that no new service is announced in advance until it is ready for use, but what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years could move the world to another point: while some believe Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project will reach such proportions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court,  others are terrified of the Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could be good material for the next generation of science fiction writers: Cory Doctorow's short story Scroogled uses Orwellian overtones to describe a future in which a human can only be approached alarmingly well from Google data.
Two juveniles helped the double killer in Ozd to dispose of the trace
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, and according to the well-founded suspicion, they helped to hide the traces of the crime, the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The youths have admitted to the act they are accused of and are now charged with aiding and abetting.
The two juveniles - according to MTI's information two girls - are defending themselves at large.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd - a 23-year-old local man - was remanded in custody on Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of premeditated murder of several people for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed him and then the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prepared to commit the crime in advance, which is also indicated by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes bid to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of one hundred percent of the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the shares within a few months.
Czech economic daily E15 knows that the Polish bid represents the highest amount bid so far for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, bids have so far been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new shareholder, and did not rule out the possibility of the Prague Stock Exchange closing down in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion crowns.
Based on the shareholder agreement, about 90 percent of the securities could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of about 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
Financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In Tuesday's comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers refer to "September 11 second."
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US President, accuses La Repubblica in Rome, who was not even able to rally his own party behind a hastily concocted bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but the congressional vote threatens that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out Geneva's Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still bail out struggling financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither funds nor new improvisations will suffice.
In the long term, we need the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, ailing financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, according to Vienna's Der Standard, which said concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, would have to dig deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is sweeping across the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'rescuers' do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they laid down in which case it makes sense to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The flight of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop collision avoidance technologies if not to mimic obstacle sensors in the natural world?
For example, that of bees.
In a surprising project unveiled at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the strategic blueprint for building the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan built the BR23C, a bio-replicated automobile robotic guidance system, a robotic minicar endowed with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shell," explained Kazuhhiro Doi, brand director of technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by the complex eyes of the uterus, which are able to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate its complex eye function, engineers turned to the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles within 2 meters in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the robot immediately changes direction by turning its wheels enough to avoid a collision, mimicking the movements of the bee.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively.
"If this were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, a layer within which collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what one bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
But, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of turning the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to bypass other bees, only rotating motion and acceleration and deceleration were used as available options for the automobile.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says it's the instinctive intelligent response that's important, not the ability to process data, much less store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
You don't need gigabytes or even megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing instant avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could enter production cars within ten years.
Another application could be to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He also got a name for the expensive child
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law, which will be applied in several tranches to buy bad loans from banks, has been completed.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
In renewed talks that lasted until after midnight Eastern Time on Saturday, congressional leaders settled a day-long dispute over a $700 billion bailout, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, who said all that remains is to put the agreement on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program would work and be effective, but more needs to be done. Pelosi says it's not about saving Wall Street, it's about turning the economic wagon.
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened at 8 p.m. Washington time on Sunday (i.e. two a.m. CET), but did not cause a spectacular rally on the stock exchanges.
The draft legislation, known as the Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act of 2008, will be voted on first by the House of Representatives on Monday and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend $700 billion one-on-one on purchases of low-quality, credit-backed securities.
For the first time, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent with $250 billion spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, with the Treasury Department buying loan-backed low-rated securities, and another $100 billion at the president's discretion.
The program will be overseen by a separate body including the Federal Reserve Chairman.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on another resolution by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can use a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase could be made through auctions and directly, ministry officials said.
The legislation allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance ministry guarantees assets of concern, for which companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system up to $700 billion, whether it's buying bad assets widely, insuring them, or avoiding systemic risk from the collapse of a major financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
Bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for government help, on the other hand, can expect their exit money — which overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute — to be restricted by the government.
Salary restrictions are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the ministry buys at auction, an excess tax will be levied on the golden parachute, unless the levied bank chief is sent into retirement.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that executive money is not excessive.
The picture is that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction will only apply to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal limit on CEO remuneration," said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire stakes in the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can eventually win from the transaction once the economy and with it the rescued bank recovers.
The bill states that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress that provides taxpayers with a way to recover expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, those on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American people asked us to do, which is that it does not protect taxpayer dollars," said Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California.
Her Ohio Democratic counterpart, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were pushed by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices of industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of industry increased only marginally by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing sectors also increased marginally by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to a 4.6 percent monthly price increase in bag and belt production and a 2.5 percent monthly price increase in footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 percent).
Price declines occurred in the petroleum processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and instrument manufacturing (0.9 percent) and, minimally, wood processing (0.1 percent) sectors.
Prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price growth was between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which have a significant share in domestic sales of industry, increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the carry-over effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing industries, prices increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4 percent).
Price increases of 13.2 percent were observed in the manufacturing of fabricated metal products, while in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which represent a dominant weight, by 11 percent.
Price decreases occurred in the textiles and textile manufacturing sectors (2.5 percent) and the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Prices in manufacturing as a whole have increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
In domestic sales, among the groups of industries by purpose, capital goods sectors showed the largest monthly price increase in August (0.7 percent).
Prices in the consumer goods sector increased by 0.3 percent, while prices in the energy and downstream sectors remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increases were observed in the energy and downstream sectors (16.8 percent).
Price growth of 6.8 percent was recorded in consumer goods sectors and a 1.4 percent decrease in capital goods.
Export sales prices of industry measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, decreasing by 3.9 percent on a 12-month basis.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar in one month, and strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Do you no longer need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister said in front of local Hungarian leaders in Chicago.
In his opinion, "now almost everything depends only on the timely establishment of an electronic access control and control system overseas".
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry authorization under the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
From today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy will hold talks in Washington.
He will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will be awarded the Middle Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are also in favour of the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, both expressed their support for the government's $700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but some politicians are calling for the Treasury secretary's resignation.
After days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and the administration announced in the early hours of Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at melting down the frozen credit market have become central issues of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain present themselves as better placed than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues come to the fore, Obama has once again gained some advantage, melting away McCain's lead after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's vice presidential nomination.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would pass Congress quickly.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection clauses that he also supported.
"We must act now, responsibly ... Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "this is going to be hard for all of us to swallow ... But doing nothing is simply not a viable option."
The Republican senator said the proposal included setting up a committee to oversee the Treasury Secretary and limiting severance pay for top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives hopes to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Journal review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have voters become more self-conscious - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the CSU's poor performance in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria in order to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article Bavarian revolution devours its fathers.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of Christian democracy as a whole, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but Sunday marked the end of a process that had been plausible almost exactly ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below the 50 percent level for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the so-called Stoiber era.
This is due to the CSU's consistent modernization in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been greatly mistaken in the pace. However, secularization, educational achievements, and the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the electorate to the CSU.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the political consequences of this can also be seen.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have voters become more self-aware, critical and wayward.
It is also striking that in recent weeks it is precisely the classical civic groups that have distanced themselves the most from the CSU; liberal professions, craftsmen, high school graduates and those with higher education.
Here, support for the CSU has already shrunk to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who, with whom? Party chairmen are restrained on coalition issues" deals with the turbulent domestic political situation that developed after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ has shown itself open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss a coalition.
The election has been made, now everything revolves around the coalition; In the debate on public television, party leaders barely allowed any insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether he could envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current ÖVP president as vice-chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
Repetition of this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open within the party for the time being, and issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-and-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Playpen: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit kicked off today in Paris, hosted this year by France, which represents the rotating Presidency of the European Union.
In her message addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, drew attention to educational segregation, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, it is the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European human rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP group, Járóka warned that in addition to discrimination when hiring, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality primary education, only an insignificant proportion of them can obtain tertiary education".
Járóka further emphasized that as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the realization of other human rights.
Investing in early years education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the European Union Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections among the widest possible audience, both Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier Roma students start school, the better their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market increase; contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"The right of Roma to quality education must be guaranteed on the basis of their citizenship of the European Union, and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education must be guaranteed", Lívia Járóka highlighted.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for the immediate acceleration of school desegregation processes, for which the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka demanded.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equality Summit, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination set at European and Member State level.
Fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to take out insurance contracts with applicants based on people's drug purchase data.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will spiral out of control.
"There is a data protection program that always makes the use of prescription data subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in independent hands, otherwise we're leaving the chicken coop to the fox," Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription tracking program, was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make premiums and claims dependent on the health status of the applicant customer, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not take out insurance with it.
In the past, a person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only after knowing the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: he easily obtains from pharmacies what medicines the person has purchased in the past year and a half based on the customer's identification number, and from this the program itself infers what kind of illness he has and what his medical condition is.
For example, if you regularly take large doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that you have virtually unmanageably high blood lipid levels, which immediately puts you in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program on the market, some of them also specify a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little left to do except paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include the fact that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former is not.
Separate companies have been set up to request and process the data, and they ask for the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although no penalty has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate health privacy law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurers.
Congress has before it a bill that would give authorities control over data reporting companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his program, which would make the transfer of data subject subject to the explicit consent of the data subject.
It is another matter that the data subject cannot refuse consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox's benevolence.
CSU: Grace for a Transitional Time
At the end of October, the fate of the defunct Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided
Despite the dismal electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and discussions on personnel issues at the Bavarian CSU summits have been postponed for the time being.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional prime minister Günther Beckstein remain in place, and the question is how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the vote, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized duo showed that they do not cling to their chairs with all their might.
This was an attempt to appease angry members of the faction and base, who demanded personal consequences for losing the absolute majority a day after the "Bavarian tsunami".
Five years ago, albeit under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career, the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, the CSU was "dominant" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count high in the southern province, which is key to Hungary's economy, they will definitely be forced to form a coalition in the future.
In one of the first signs of a realignment within the party, Horst Seehofer, a possible successor to Huber, will be part of a small reconnaissance team that will begin discussions with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters, organized along right-wing values, about a possible government coalition in Munich.
In a strange irony of fate, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by the Huber-Beckstein duo as a coup opportunity, enters the legislature on the list of Free Voters, and then the ambitious municipal politician was treated harshly.
CSU leaders are now devoting all their energy to somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been weaving ties from the background, will also play an active role in the transition, with the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president calling September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
Huber on Monday made some bitter comments to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, is somehow not restored together.
Merkel, who is struggling to hide her disappointment over the fiasco, said the CSU's loss of ground would not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Which is relative, of course: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No opposition MPs made it to the Belarusian parliament in the wake of Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability provided in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), illegalities were committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the country's 10-million-strong legislature has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his term as president for the fourth time in controversial elections in 2006 as a result of a constitutional amendment, would this time "allow" some opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
Thus, ODSZ also withdrew from the boycott considered earlier.
The opposition expectations came as Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia and has taken out loans to reduce rising Russian gas imports and has also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgas, which owns gas pipelines through the country, to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are denied entry due to Belarusian political structures, which are described as undemocratic.
The OSCE's emphasis in assessing the election campaign on positive shifts rather than shortcomings, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from running, was a preliminary indication of relief.
However, the OSCE's flash report on Monday criticised the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, there has been a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state on paper, has been considering the two territories independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should be maintained, despite the fact that "the authorities were afraid to allow even an opposition member into the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning protests against the results, but rather trying to convey a message about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, local authorities are blocking distribution, but I can still see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly," Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its main achievement, is considered inadequate even by the most officially supported group of pensioners.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before social security "reminiscent of the silence of the cemetery" breaks down, Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in deeds," so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, along with other largely global issues.
Today there will also be a Franco-Indian summit, where cooperation in nuclear energy will be discussed in particular.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, member states have not yet reached a common understanding on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even raised at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as EU President-in-Office, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agreed to double trade flows to more than one hundred billion euros within five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade increased from EUR 25 billion to EUR 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In this spirit, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally merged, meaning that air traffic may also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi ranks only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, the latter of which has been condemned in all its forms on both sides and urged a UN conference to be convened.
They have also called for an end to the Doha Trade Round, although both have been heavily involved in the setback so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as with the fact that a global deal should be concluded at next year's climate conference and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising, and they supported calling an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will go to the French capital today to conclude a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to news agencies, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair with a strong field.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th edition of the most important international copyright meeting. Buchmesse fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries on an area of 171,790 square meters with more than 403,000 books on display. The guest of honour will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square metres by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Pavilion 5.0 of Buchmesse, where data, trends and prospects on the state of Italian publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
Unique in the history of Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed for the entry and exit of workers.
From today, this new measure will come into force against those who block and then go out for a coffee during working hours.
The anti-loafer novelty was unveiled today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The turnstiles," Brunetta said, "are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services."
"This is a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
With Chigi Palace, the equipping of all buildings of the Council of Ministers is completed.
According to Masi, "the installation of turnstiles is also important from a symbolic point of view."
We did not see any resistance from the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved of the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over during working hours, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta advises with a smile: "a good little cappuccino at seven in the morning can work wonders"
At the College of Public Administration in Rome
At the conference held, the Minister explained that "in three months, absenteeism of public sector workers due to illness has decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more commuters in one year".
He added, however, that the Italian public administration should be made more efficient
, "which, according to the minister, has had twice as high wage dynamics as the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and has also far exceeded the inflation rate".
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered to join a petition supported by Italy's Organisation of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest against the provisions of Brunetta's decree.
"While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data to support the reduction of absenteeism due to illness, the army of 'tireless loafers' continues to grow," the consumer association wrote.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative employees gathered across Italy to declare war on the illegal provisions of the decree."
The regional administrative court is challenged, inter alia, the abolition of supplementary sickness benefit for illness on grounds of service, the extension of the period of stay at home for workers on sick leave, i.e. the period during which a patient visitor may appear, and several other aspects laid down in the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is paramount
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 of which result in death and 27 result in permanent disability.
According to data from the Occupational Accident Insurance Company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and kills almost twice as many people as homicide.
Today, Anmil is celebrating the 58th edition of the Day of Victims of Accidents at Work in all departments of Italy, traditionally held on the second Sunday in October, to raise awareness of this dramatic problem among institutions, civil society organisations and the mass media.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm that prevention plays an extremely important role in occupational accidents," said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, president of the National Association of Disabled People at Work.
The head of state praised the association's "steadfast commitment to workplace prevention, protecting the interests of accident victims, helping victims' families and raising public awareness".
"There is natural and sincerely shared outrage at tragedies of this kind, which by their scale attract media and public attention, but in reality we are faced with dramatic incidents that are repeated again and again every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "There is undoubtedly a lack of resources, funding for education and information is crucial.
Of particular importance are intra-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people on the verge of entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to allow attention to be lost on the social importance of this issue, and we need more effective legislation that must be enforced.
For his part, the President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "the serious social significance of fatal accidents at work, which burden everyone's conscience, and institutions are required to put an end to them as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this nature is still astonishingly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"At the same time, we don't want this downward trend to be matched by declining attention, because it is precisely when attention wanes that the greatest tragedies happen."
"We believe that, on a general level, we are still not doing enough to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex programme of actions.
"In our view, we need stricter supervision and control," Mercandelli stressed, "as well as stronger intervention in the field of workforce training, starting with school education."
"Further efforts are also needed to inform and sensitise the public," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a problem at the societal level."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the safety net for compensation for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the scheme has drifted in recent years."
"The goal, therefore, is to restore the security provided by insurance to workers, because the fate of accident victims should not depend on arbitrary or handout measures taken by legislators."
Hearing loss can be caused by MP3 players
Listening to portable playback devices such as MP3s for extended periods of time at high volumes can cause permanent hearing damage
said the European Commission in a report published in Brussels, referring to the advice published today by the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The report shows that 5 to 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music players at high volume levels for more than an hour a day for five years may suffer permanent hearing loss," the explanation reads.
"It is worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones en masse are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific assessments indicate an indisputable risk that we urgently need to respond to," the Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this issue widely.
In the light of this advice, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function effectively and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise pollution caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern. The European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to explore possible measures to protect children and young people from exposure to noise from portable players and similar devices," concluded the Commission.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but there is growing concern about data on hearing damage due to excessive use of these sound sources.
However, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise nuisance, which can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
In its opinion, the EU scientific committee explains that users of portable playback devices who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week have noise nuisance above the current maximum noise at work.
If someone listens to music under similar conditions for an extended period of time, they are at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5-10% of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up commission for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, with results expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the committee entitled "The Future of Rome's Cathedral Capital", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will draw up Rome's guidelines.
Following the final remarks in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee with a view to submitting the Strategic Plan for the Capital officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee that brings together all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas," Alemanno stresses, "and its task is to develop proposals for Rome's development vision on which policymakers, such as the General Assembly and the Committee of Local Government, can rely.
There is no conflict of competence, we just wanted a platform where big plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, once it has completed its work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the committee entitled "The Future of Rome's Cathedral Capital", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work superfluous, arguing that the advice it draws up is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard proves to be adequate, as in the case of the Attali Commission in France, which I take for granted in the case of Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often scattered in day-to-day affairs and in dealing with emergencies that arise from time to time.
In contrast, we look further ahead, we plan for the longer term, and we are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The Mayor of Rome wishes to state that 'this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless 'waterhead', as it is completely free of charge, will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, but serves as a food for thought and aims to involve the best minds of the capital'.
According to Alemanno, "we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will allow our city to take the leap in standards it so desperately needs, thinking about its future in a unified spirit."
A future in which the Mayor of Rome stresses that "it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but will look much further", we see in it not only the future metropolis and the status of capital, but also "the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first is an anti-American president. We'll show you why.
A well-known self-professed independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who ruined the American economy through his decisions and maintained close ties (as he does privately today) with hostile Islam."
As the election draws closer, attacks on Obama are intensifying.
One Miami woman wrote online: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama brazenly believes he can win the highest public dignity in a nation that has had two governors and five senators in black!"
These attacks are, in fact, meaningless; They are racist, of course, but they do not answer voters' questions about whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and by a significant margin.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
In the interior of the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in an editorial: "We know well who the true American patriot is casting his vote for in the voting booth.
A side of the American way of thinking appears here that remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want and we'll know where to put it, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear by it: if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Never before have such words been uttered until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all this reasoning, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's tenure. 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was tipped to the bottom by flying home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans did not have to pack.
Still, most believe Iraq was Bush's weak point.
A huge task awaits whoever will replace George W.
USA: The economic collapse is already being felt by journalists, and the time has come for austerity in newsrooms. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of print media.
The PEW research institute asked five hundred American journalists what they thought about the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future at the moment.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns regarding credibility had diminished.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the bankruptcy of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, i.e. the editorial offices that produce the newspaper.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands by this, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved, say the journalists interviewed.
Today, there is a visible and complex pessimism in American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Print vs. electronic media.
Press workers have no difficulty seeing where the World Wide Web is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the print press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists rose to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to opting for technology, hoping it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press industry, there is a gap between editorial leaders, i.e. directors, and correspondents working for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of executives are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, compared to 23 percent locally.
Some associate this with secure employment.
Nationally, 47 percent of managers fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, the figure is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In a nation as vast as the United States of 300 million people, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a "must or don't need" basis.
Directors are usually paid high salaries, and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to pension and health insurance premiums.
Leave, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: x days in the first year, and also in the third, until it reaches the maximum of 15 days after a certain period of time.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second criminal division of the Court of Justice of Rome, rejected a request from Danilo Coppola, a real estate businessman who wanted to move from his home town of Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for economic bankruptcy as part of an investigation into the Unipol-BNL share swap agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a ban on leaving Grottaferrata's home.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional move from the small rural town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor made a negative proposal) would allow him to influence the company's affairs and access the evidence against him.
The elite are at risk
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a significant number of Americans were and still are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between the traditional, restrained East Coast stance that supports federal institutions and business circles and the growing new anti-Washington and anti-financial stance in central and southern states.
This line was critically expressed in the vote in the House of Commons mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic realignment that is still taking place predicts or allows us to see, not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world and perhaps even outside it.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating phenomena that have been latent for some time and are finally coming to light in this new atmosphere.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the bringing back to public consciousness the dual category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects those banking-financial institutions which, although they have close ties with the rest of the world, nevertheless, first and foremost, and quite widely, they bring with them people and families who live in a single country, in one state.
This, in turn, poses a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So the crisis may seem global in economic terms, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to have been essentially sidelined: proof of this is the European Union, which, navigating between different interests and divergent national strategies, is unable to set a single political line.
So everyone looks to individual national governments for intervention, bailouts, recovery and new rules, but above all for the opening up of funds: because in times of distress only individual states have economic resources, financial stocks that may be able to put things right.
They have both the tools and the mandate to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that probably no other market or international organisation will ever have to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation-statehood is fully consistent with the fact that recent economic growth has given increasing importance to a factor that is closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future increasingly depended on things that were not abstract in the least, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, but are completely tied to a delimited place, an area.
Thus, whoever rules the area has far more trump cards than someone who was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
This brings me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Whoever says territory, state, government necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to be producing two consistent phenomena:
On the one hand, it is an objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can take control of events.
On the other hand, it brings about a complete loss of faith on the part of the current leadership, especially the economic managers, who have proved to be completely inadequate and have proved that there is still a lot of obscure territory ahead of them.
Together, the two are even more deeply significant and, in a sense, more disturbing: the loss of credibility, impatience, incompetence and separation that affects the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus, it seems that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite, which has hitherto been at its peak, is over. It expired before their actions, experiences, way of life, culture, in the complex sense of the word, were embraced. As a result, the social elite becomes increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the need for leadership, covertly, fuels a diverse but powerful movement of delegitimation against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This manifests itself in unexpected "riots" among voters or, more recently, sudden changes in public sentiment. For example, the rise of the conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of Labour unity in Britain, or the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and even customs, press and renowned intellectuals, is less and less able to understand and therefore represent less and less what has been going on for some time in the deeper strata of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is intensifying, spreading and potentially generating ever more unbridled emotions.
Nevertheless, to speak of an "imminent revolt of the masses" would frankly be an exaggeration.
But walking with your eyes open doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with super strong glue
With the help of a super-strong glue, you can overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This is the goal set by several American research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
Using a piece of glue measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue a 100-kilogram body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
The STUDY - The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists was born from the further development of already existing special materials with a so-called carbon nanotube structure.
"We have to think of the principle of how the glue works like a pack of spaghetti-like pipes," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers got the idea from the gecko's leg covered with microscopic folds, which gives the animal perfect grip.
Tests with materials such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles, but at the same time "easily detaches from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
WALKING ON A WALL? - "This material can be useful as a temporary glue," adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking more about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can also find further applications in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can still wait.
ANOTHER RESEARCH - The University of California, Berkeley is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California demonstrated an adhesive made of a hair-like microfiber material that undergoes self-cleaning as it moves on the surface, providing perfect adhesion at all times.
Medications? No juice involved!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in summer, when ingested together with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption, amplifying or reducing their effect, depending on the case. This can also have serious health consequences.
The risks of using boxed or fresh juices together with certain medications were highlighted by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London. He announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering patient health.
Grapefruit juice has already been indicted when it was found to be able to enhance the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiolytics, pacemakers and nerve drugs to levels considered toxic.
RISKY DRUGS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official gazette, warning doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-consumption and to pay attention to what they drink when taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
A long list of active ingredients whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmacy at Milan State University, points out: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, will arrange for changes to be given in the particulars of the drug concerned.
That is why you should always read the leaflet of the medicine you intend to take, and if something is not understandable, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly," emphasized the specialist of the Ansa institute.
Paul Krugman awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics
American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of commercial models and the territorial relationships of economic activity.
Krugman, a 55-year-old neo-Keynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the fiercest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy policies.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for U.S. history than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast caused quite a bit of controversy, it was repeatedly reproached by the economist, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and a little shocked, at how quickly public interest moved beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said in late 2002.
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the European Central Bank's executive committee, called Krugman a "very valuable economist" but also rather "aggressively disseminated his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open-code suite of applications that increase personal productivity and target an ever-widening audience as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from the liberal professions to public administration.
After almost a year of work overseen by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office introduces several new features: in addition to the welcome screen and a reimagined, less Spartan user interface, it also offers several major innovations. These include compatibility with Apple's Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with the 2007 Office system, so that Open Office can open Microsoft documents with the new extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting are the specific functions of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by e-mail. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module while maintaining the page-correct layout.
You can also create "hybrid PDF" documents using the same interface, which combines the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or word processing elements.
In-app sharing has also been improved: spreadsheets support workbook collaboration but prevents overwriting each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked in a different color, which helps them be easier to identify during the review phase.
Some companies are already working on making some OpenOffice features available on the cloud (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be unveiled in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available on mirror sites since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the suite is also available for Linux.
On request, we can pick up the installation CD at home or at work.
Freebies are probably the biggest attraction for home app adoption, but the Open Office suite is now trying to make a splash in the business sector as well, as it can count on numerous public administration and school projects.
There is also a lack of education, consulting and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a word processor equivalent to Word; Calc, a spreadsheet designed to replace Excel; For Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, similar to an Access database; and finally Draw the graphics module.
The 2008 target is 5 million downloads. But considering that with the release of the new version, we are already at 3,600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is also positive, this is the fourth doping case
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl from Austria, competing for the Gerolsteiner team, tested positive again, winning the bronze medal and the jersey for best mountaineer.
The news was published on the website of the Internet newspaper Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth driver after Italy's Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol and German Gerolsteiner driver Stefan Schumacher to test positive for Cera, considered the third-generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like tests in recent weeks, was examined by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm a positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose third place and will be banned from racing for two years.
The news of Kohl's positive third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of France's anti-doping agency, who told The Associated Press that he had reported the positive doping result to Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to finish on the podium behind Carlos Sastre of Spain and Cadel Evans of the United States, as well as winning the polka dot jersey for best mountaineer.
IMMIGRANTS: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy has only recently transformed from a country of emigrants into a popular destination for reluctant immigrants.
Is this why "Belpaese" is transformed into a racist nation? That's the question posed by the New York Times, which devotes a lengthy article to the debate over racism in Italy, based on the case of Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits.
The case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions have the "strongest integration and the highest employment" and "anti-immigrant sentiment and support for the Northern League."
To underscore rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Moreover.
The new laws demanded by the League to tighten the reins on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants have been cited as an example of the change in mood in Italy.
Both the Pope and the President of the Republic highlighted this tendency: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI in the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church should work together to defeat racism."
The plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, has been found
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane have been found, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, sheriff of Madera County, dispelled any remaining doubts: "After locating the plane, we sent a team and now we can be sure that it is the plane Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff further confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (NTSB) said that within hours of the wreckage, an investigative committee was called in to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Also yesterday in California, near the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two IDs in Fosset's name issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, some cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett was dispatched a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set numerous peaks, through which he wrote himself into history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the globe for the first time in a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he also circled the Earth by plane without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual but original and distinctly designed SUV with large surfaces and clean corners.
That's all about Mercedes-Benz's latest "compact SUV", with which the German automaker tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the launch campaign for the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will also be surprising and unusual.
This is because the advertising campaign accompanying the launch of the new vehicle uses a hitherto unknown means of media communication, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The billboard action, which consists of three phases, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the stereoscopic presentation of the car, in which it will be displayed in almost real size and three-dimensional shape with the help of special glasses distributed around the new SUV, the Corso Como.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car stands out from the poster.
Then, thanks to innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK is visible one by one to form a unified image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Will this attract prospective customers? We'll see.
We show you who Italian football hooligans are
Young people from Triveneto. They are likely to be disqualified from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls that the whole of Italy is now ashamed of? They are members of a group called 'Ultras Italia', which has been following the national team for years and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with opposing fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers come from Trivento.
As well as Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small sporadic groups (actually only a few units) from Campania and Puglia.
They waved Italian flags with the fans' hometowns on them: on Saturday, they were taken down so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi fan team, the Levski fans.
The Italian football federation made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were name-specific tickets, so it's easier to check the fan team.
The Ministry of the Interior checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there were no people who were being prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related prius were denied tickets and exit.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior is awaiting reports from the Sofia police and then taking the necessary measures: fans arrested or identified during the riots can face a five-year ban.
It is an international ban that applies not only to visits to stadiums in Italy, but to all stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans cannot set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we must also fear that hooligans will find followers, that is, that others will join this barely one hundred and fifty people.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and those who behave in this way must not be excused," the interior ministry said.
So it's better to keep your eyes open, especially as Wednesday's national team match day in Lecce is approaching.
In Puglia, there is a small cell supporting Italian ultras.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting of the Monitoring Service, and on Tuesday there will be a meeting of the Committee for the Analysis of Sports Events, which can also count on a division of the internal security service, the secret services dealing with fan behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's chanting and swinging arm during the Italian anthem? It is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was expressed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the monitoring service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and, before that, by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously chief of police in Trieste, a city that has had a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true that it is not forbidden to cheer the Ducé in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person in the surveillance service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's also talk a little about whistling the Italian anthem: it's not a crime either, but, if I may say so, it can't be called well-being either..."
Students suffer from rising rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Tenants' Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such staggering proportions that it is preventing large segments of students from learning due to the huge total costs for families," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's Registrar's Office. "In these cities, high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of price increases has started for local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent restrictions, coupled subleases.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure is needed that will allow prices to be capped by revising the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, near Brianza, a bed costs up to €450; single rooms range from €650 (Bande Nere area) to €800 on average (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) and up to €900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed space costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where most students live close to the university, a bed costs €250/€280 for a double room and €370-500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they charge about 600 euros for a single room and 450 euros for a double room.
Slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) are prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save some money in the suburban districts: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they charge 300/450 euros for a bed place, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price range is highest around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed place, and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they carry more weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often look for accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25 to 30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye good old Cinema Paradiso, the days of old cinema halls are gone in cities
Traditional cinemas are closing in favor of Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The images created by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively depict what is happening in Italy's big cities, but also in rural regions.
The crowding out of cinemas - the emergence of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the withering away of one-room cinemas in city centres - seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend passing away, an acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which won Tornatore an Oscar twenty years ago and the Grand Prix at the Cannes Festival, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, a yearning for a cinematic experience that may have been lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, speak clearly: 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, leads the way among the most affected regions, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that multiplexes are responsible for their disappearance is evidenced by the fact that these three regions of Italy have the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas: in the last five years, the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same number in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec president Paolo Protti. "It's okay to build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not everyone who goes there is willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the unreplenished funds intended to support operators: the overdue debt of the state is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is an ethical and moral shame that the government is not complying with the laws in force.
It would take €16-18 million a year to sustain the market."
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city to decide to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec to protect and boost one-room cinemas in the city and interior in order to protect and boost the closures.
The provisions would include tax breaks for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: spectators will be able to enter restricted zones and park at reduced rates in certain car parks.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to cope with the dominance of multiplexes, need to improve sound and video quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that eventually led me to make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I walk past the closed Rialto or the Quirinale on Via Nazionale so I don't see the posters blackened with dust, I turn my head. I've had so many experiences here."
Close ties between politics and the 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested
"Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions".
Serious charges have been levelled by judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external participation in a criminal network.
Handcuffs also fell into the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and a lawyer nephew with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal conspiracy and was awarded €10 million in damages.
"Disregard for all legal and moral rules, and even for good taste," state prosecutors wrote. The two local authorities have declared their intention to pay lawyer Piromalli a consultancy fee.
"This would have given the clan official access to the town hall, which would have given them an additional opportunity to control and direct the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian Regional Assembly, makes no secret of the fact that in the region there are "many collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where mafia penetration is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist pressure from the 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean."
This morning's arrests are a continuation of the events of July, when police announced that they had managed to behead the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, again due to alleged links between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the reigning Christian Democrat mayor at the time of dissolution, led the centre-right coalition in the second round of voting in 2006.
He cried scandal when County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He summoned Marco Minnini, then deputy interior minister, to court and accused him of plotting everything for political purposes. But the court explained in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had gone so far as to demand changes to the A3 project.
The wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione, the state prosecutors wrote, reveals that he was "willing to comply with the demands of an entrepreneur representing an extensive group known to be close to the Piromalli family, subordinating the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the clan."
The energy comes from the waves, and now come the big ones
An inexhaustible source of energy, which makes up 70 percent of the planet's surface and is yet to be discovered by major international energy companies
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have set their eyes on and are now trying to get their hands on.
For a hundred years, researchers have been researching how to derive energy from the movements of the sea. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of exploiting offshore energy was shelved, but today the demands of environmental protection and the renewed rise in the price of oil are giving new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by facilities that use sea waves.
This is twice what nuclear power plants currently produce.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants in full swing.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and signed an agreement for a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies are opting for offshore energy, including some who have been committed to conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies that harness ocean energy and is considering working with us," a spokesperson for one of the oil giant's affiliates told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining the necessary authorisation issued by the US Energy Commission for the launch of the offshore energy project in Alaska.
This is no small feat, especially considering that the US is currently extracting oil in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched plans for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also exploring the path of energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as the details are known, show increasing interest.
The technology is yet to be developed.
According to experts, the technology is still rudimentary, not least because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about its environmental impact.
The facilities that currently exist, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not pose too much of a problem in terms of ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, installations with a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders located in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity reaches land via cables under the sea.
So far, four facilities of this nature are in the planning stages and are awaiting federal approval. Part of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines located in New York's East River Strait.
At low tide, the movement of water spins the blades of the turbines, and this rotational movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it had a long list of partners waiting for permits to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, particular attention should be paid to the potential of tides.
Although it is intermittent, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and are therefore considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 on harnessing tidal energy. This amount is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
