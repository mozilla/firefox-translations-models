The first economic reform was carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, the size of China’s economy has grown 90 times.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for the industry.
China's GDP could exceed the United States in two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, named, has formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is about 4,800 km from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind speed of 64 km per hour (40 mph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Centre predicted that Danielle would strengthen into a storm on Wednesday.
The storm is far from the mainland area making it difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

People beat the window glass with a chair, but the glass couldn't break.
"One of the panels was finally broken, and they started going out through the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars provide light and heat, because the energy created when the hydrogen atoms combine (or fusion) form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.  
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
Steel needles float above the surface of the water due to surface tension.
Surface pressure occurs because the water molecules on the surface are mutually attractive to each other than the air molecules above it.
Water molecules create an invisible layer on the surface of the water that allows objects such as needles to float on the water. 
The blades on the modern ice glove have a double side with empty basins in between. These two sides allow for better grip on ice, even when tilted.
Because the side that the blade is slightly bent, when the eye is tilted to one side or the other, then the edge that intersects with ice is also bent.
This caused the skater to turn. If the skater board tilts to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skater board tilts to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to the previous energy level, the atoms had to dispose of the excess energy they got from the light.
"They do this by emitting a small particle of a small light commonly called "photoken."
“Scientists call this process “stimulating radiation emissions” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes the emission of light photons, and light is one type of radiation.”
The next image shows the atom that emits a photon. Of course, in the real world photons are much smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller in size than the constituents of atoms
After operating for hundreds of hours, the bulb filaments eventually set fire and the bulb no longer luminous.
The light bulb needs to be replaced. Please be careful when changing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the light fixture must be turned off or the cable is removed.
This is due to the flow of electricity flowing to the socket where the metal part of the bulb is located, which can cause a fatal electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or metal base of the bulb when some of them are still stuck in the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood flows from the heart in channels called arteries and returns to the heart through channels called veins. The smallest channel is called a capillaries.
Triceratops has teeth that can not only pulverize leaves, but also branches or roots that are very hard.
Some scientists think Tricerato eats sago palm, which is a common type of plant in the Kapur era.
These plants look like small palms with pointed and sharp leaves.
A Triceratops can use its strong beak to trim the leaves before eating the stem.
Other scientists say that these plants are so poisonous that no dinosaurs seem to eat them, although now sloth bears and other animals such as parrots (aberties of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How does gravity attract me? If you stand on the surface of Io, you will weigh more light than you were on Earth.
People weighing 90 kg on Earth will weigh 16 kg in Io. That's why gravity has a lower attractiveness.
The sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth you can stand on. The entire part of the Sun is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as you get further away from the center of the Sun.
The outside we see when we see the Sun is called a photofer, which means "light ball".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had a phase, just like the moon.
The phase occurs because only the side of Venus (or from the side of the Moon) facing the Sun gets lighting. The Venus phase supports the theory of Copernicus which states that the planet circles the Sun.
Subsequently, a few years later in 1639, a British astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus.
Britain has gone through a long period of peace after the conquest of Danelaw.
However, in 991 Etheld was confronted with a Viking fleet larger than any fleet since the Guthrum fleet a century earlier.

"At first he named the Hangeul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct voice for the people's instruction"."
There are many theories about how Sanskrit was created. One is about the migration of the Aryans from the west to India that brings their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin used in Europe.
The earliest known books in the world were written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit language just faded due to hierarchies.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is the source of a wide variety of modern Indian languages, just like Latin which is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the completion of the French battle, Germany began preparing to invade the British Island.
"Germany named their attack "Operation Sea Lions". Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British Army were lost during an evacuation from Dunkirk, so their soldiers were quite weak. "
"However, the Royal Navy is still far stronger than the German Navy ("Krigesmarine") and could have destroyed the spacecraft sent across the English Channel."
However, very few British Navy ships are near the possibility of an invasion route because the admirals fear their ship sank as a result of German airstrikes.
Let’s start with an explanation of Italy’s plans. Italy is basically a "male sister" from Germany and Japan.
It has weaker soldiers and weaker naval, although they have just built four new ships just before the start of the war. 
Italy's main goal is African countries. To seize these countries, they need to have a troop runway, so that troops can sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa. 
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to that action, Italian warships are not supposed to do anything else.
Now Japan. Japan is a land-state, just like Britain.
A submarine is a ship designed to travel in the sea, and remains there for a long time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. At that time the ship was very slow and had a very limited firing range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled by sea, but along with the development of radar and the more accurate the submarines went under the sea so as not to be seen.
German submarines are called U-boats. Germans are experts in navigation and operating submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the German war was not believed to have many submarines.
"Yes King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "King of Sons", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times."
What was interesting was that he was not considered important in ancient times, and was not recorded on most of the list of ancient kings. 
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. When many past tombs are robbed, this tomb is not disturbed.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare rocks.
The discovery of the ruji wheel made the Assyrian carriage lighter, faster, and better prepared to run ahead of the army and other trains.
The arrows from the death bow can penetrate the armour of the opponent's army. Around the year 1000 BC, Asyria introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. At that time the scooter had not been found so that the Asirian cavalry fought on the back of the horse without a base.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. It could be the most recognizable person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two works of Greek literature: Iliad and Odyssey poems.

The Greeks who are also famous are the mathematicians Pythagoras, popularly related to his theory of the relationship between the sides of the right triangle.
There are various estimates about how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated that this language is between the second and fourth ranks in the most commonly spoken language rankings in the world.
The number of native speakers varies, depending on whether the closely related dialect is calculated or not.
The estimate ranges from 340 million and 500 million speakers, as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but the script is different; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, the northern region of Estonia was strongly influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they created the literal language of Estonia.
"This language was created based on the German alphabet and one character "Ã•/Ãμ" was added. "
As time went on, many of the words of loans from Germany were fused. This was the beginning of enlightenment.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as mastered tools in interactive classes (charging story boards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reassess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design demands project components to be connected to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity. 
The disadvantages of the magnifying lens lie in the focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to get a focal length range is much larger than the main lens.
This becomes less problematic because lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allows the magnifying lens to produce images with quality equivalent to those produced by lenses with a fixed focus distance.
Another disadvantage of the lum lens is the maximum opening (speed) of the lens is usually slower.
This causes cheap lenses to be difficult to use in less light conditions without using a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies to DVD format is overscan.
Most televisions are made to please the public in general.
That is why, everything that is visible on the TV has the boundaries on the top, bottom, and side sides that are cut.
This is done to make sure the image covers the entire screen. This is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edges may be cut off, and if there is text that is too down, then the text will be cut as well.
Traditional medieval castles have long inspired the imagination, bringing up the shadow of horse riding group fights with spears, banquets, and Arthurian knights.
Even when standing in the middle of the ruins are thousands of years old, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battle in the past, that it can barely hear the sound of horses tracing the rock road and smelling the scent of fear that comes from the dungeon pit.
However, is our imagination based on reality? First of all, what was the castle built for? How were the castles designed and built?
As per the characteristics of the period, Kirby Muxloe's castle is more like a fortifying house than a real castle.
Its large glass windows and thin walls will not be able to longer withstand the existing attacks.
In the 1480s, when its construction was started by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against a small group of traveling robbers.
The balance of power is a system that is, the European countries seek to defend the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European countries should try to prevent one country from becoming too strong, and therefore national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish successor marked the first war with a central issue of a balance of power.
This marks an important change, as European powers will no longer have a pretext to become religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years War will be the last war marked as a religious war.
The Artemis temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in a burning action carried out by Herostratus.

Indus Valley Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that covers most of Pakistan today and some areas in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization is growing rapidly in the Indus River basin, which is the origin of its name.
Although some researchers speculate that civilization was also formed in the basin of the Sarasvati river that now dries, the naming of the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization will be appropriate, while others call it the Harappa Civilization, named after Harappa, which is the location of its first excavation in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire helped in the development of medical progress.
The doctors began to be recruited by the Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps to operate after the battle.
The surgeon has knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from the extract of popi and schocolamin seeds from herban seeds.
They become experts in amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as tornikets and arterial clamps to stem the blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman empire had progressed rapidly in the field of medicine and created a lot of knowledge that we know today.
Pure origami is origami with a limit of only one fold that is allowed at one time, does not allow more complicated folds such as folds, and each fold has a straightforward location.

It can be adjusted so that it is easier to read and also more colors or fewer colors as desired. 
"Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome that classically defines three set of symptoms, including impulsivity, disruption, and hyperactivity aka excess energy"."
"This is not an inability to learn, but a learning disorder; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe about 2 million American children". 
Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like schoolwork, but can concentrate on the things they like to do, for example playing games or watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without puncture.
"These children tend to be involved in many problems, as they are "involved in risky behavior, fighting, and challenging the authorities" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated in the usual way.
ADD affects the relationship of a person with other peers because other children can not understand why the sufferer acts like that or why the sufferer spells in his own way or the level of maturity is different.
With the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn as mentioned above, the basic rate of knowledge is obtained also changes.
Approach to get information is different. The emphasis is no longer on individual memory, but the ability to remember text.
In essence, the Renaissance created a significant change in the approach to the learning and dissemination of science. 
Unlike other primates, the hominid no longer wears their hands to move or withstand the load or when hanging over the tree.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand in bearing the load when walking with a finger book.
The human hand is shorter than his feet, with a straighter phalanges.
Fossils of 2 million to 3 million-year-old hand bones show this shift in hand specialization from a driver to mover.
Some people believe that having many conscious dreams that are artificially induced quite often can be very tiring.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of conscious dreams increase the length of duration between each state of REM.
With less REM per night, the condition when you are asleep soundly and when the body recovers so it is not often enough that it causes a problem.
It's as tiring as it's when you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream of being conscious every night.

Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the most people associated with traveling: Recreational tourism.
This is when someone goes somewhere very different to their daily life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, entertainment parks, and camping places are often the most common places visited by recreational tourists.
If the purpose of a person to visit a place is to know his history and culture, then this type of tourism is also known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit a wide variety of landmarks from certain countries or may only choose to focus on one area only.
Seeing this activity, the Colonists also asked for reinforcements.  
Troops strengthened pole positions including the first and third New Hampshire regiments consisting of 200 men, under Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both of them became generals).
Stark's men took a position along the fence at the north end of the Colonical position.
When the low tide opens a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extend the fence with a short stone wall to the north that ends on the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark bet about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until it regularly passes through it. 
The U.S. plan relies on the launch of a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder could launch a diversion attack on the British fornication in Bordentown, to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing will carry 700 militiamen across the river in Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy forces from fleeing.
The main attacking force of 2,400 people will cross the nine-mile river north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an early-dawn attack.
With the change from a quarter-mile run to a half-mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Indeed a half-mile reliable runner, which is able to reach half a mile in two minutes, must have a hefty speed but he must develop endurance in all dangers.
A small percentage of cross-country runs in winter, combined with gymnasium exercises for the upper body, is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutritional practice alone cannot produce elite performance, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve exercise performance and enjoyment.
Medium-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; but, there is a lot of misconceptions about the little equipment needed to take part.
Products can be purchased according to their needs, but most will be few or completely no impact on performance.
The athletes may feel that they like a product even if the product does not provide tangible benefits.
Atoms can be considered as one of the fundamental constituent elements of all matter.
It is a very complex entity consisting, according to the simplification of the Bohr model, over the electrons orbiting the center of the nucleus, similar to the planet orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electric charge.
To check the victim, you must first observe the scene to ensure your safety.

Each tantrum or nomadic movement lasts about 17 days.
“What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "little room", and was first created by a microscope expert who observes the structure of cork."
Cells are the basic units of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
“It’s vital in studying life and being very basic. Cells are usually nicknamed the "surfing block of life."
The Nerve system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow running and not being disturbed.

If you look at objects with a microscope, you will notice that they are made up of square sets or small balls. 
Robert Hooke, a biological man from England, saw a small box inside a corkie with a microscope.
It looked like a room. He was the first to observe the dead cell
Elements and compounds can move from one condition to another and do not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid conditions are denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The water of the compound is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure either gas, liquid, or solid objects. 
Although the physical form may change, but the chemical form remains the same.
Time is something that is around us, and affects everything we do, but it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We passed through time like a series of events that passed from the future to the past.

People who have been involved for decades help us to appreciate our strength and passion while honestly judging difficulties and even failures. 
When listening to individuals sharing their own, family, and organization, we acquire valuable knowledge of the past and some personalities that affect the organization’s culture in a good or bad manner.
Although understanding one’s history does not assume an understanding of culture, it at least helps people gain an understanding of their position in the history of the organization. 
When assessing success and realizing failure, the individual and the whole person who participates discovers the value, mission, and driving power of the organization more deeply.

A convergent mindset is a problem-solving technique that combines multiple ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as fact identification, re-applicability of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor in this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, right or wrong.
This type of thinking is related to a particular science or standard procedure.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, being able to memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
By far, humans are the most expert species of the human mind.
This means that we are able to predict well what other humans feel, mean, believe, know or want.
Understanding the intentions of others is very important among these abilities, so that we can resolve the ambiguity that may exist from physical action.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of a car, you might think he's trying to steal someone's car. 
He needs to be judged differently if he loses his car keys and that is his own car that he is trying to get in.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (work at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field, and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical physician and research scientist, found the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later a patent was granted, which became the first patent in the world published in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadadian completed the construction of the first "whole body" MRI scanner, which he named "Indomimiable". "

In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn. Learning takes place in experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
"Our current experience with all the learning-based television shows "do it yourself" and the presentation of information illustrates this."
So many of us find ourselves watching television shows that give you a process or experience that doesn’t allow us to participate or apply that knowledge.

However, in other parts of the world, in the location of the bacteriological fauna that is common to you, you are much more likely to experience problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria develop faster and last longer outside the body.
Such is the scourge of the stomach of Delhi, the curse of the Pharaoh, the retribution of Montezuma, and his other comrades.
Like breathing problems in cold climates, gut problems in hot climates are pretty much found, which in many cases are not too dangerous though disturbing.
If traveling in a developing country for the first time - or in a new place - do not underestimate the potential for cultural concussions.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, also around the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, demanding physical fitness, can only take place in the summer in November-February, and are very limited to the Peninsula, Island, and Ross Sea.
Thousands of staff live here in the summer at about 4ty bases that are mostly in the area; only a few stay during the winter.
Inland Antarctica is a remote plateau covered by ice as thick as 2-3 km.
The occasional air tour specialist goes to the interior to climb the mountain or occupy the Pole. This specialist has a large base.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1,600 km trajectory from McMurdo Base on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is snow compacted with cracks that are filled and marked with flags. It can only be transported with special tractors, transporting sleds with fuel and supplies.

The most common causes of winter accidents are roads, sidewalks, and especially slippery stairs.
At least you need footwear with a proper sole. Shoes for summer are usually very slippery if worn on ice or snow, even some boots for winter are still less good.
The pattern should be quite deep, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material should be soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have nails on the site and also there are additional devices nailed to cope with slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles.
Shoe heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often stocked on highways or trails to increase grip.
Landslide snow is not an abnormal thing; steep slopes can only hold snow up to a certain amount, and the excess volume will fall as a landslide snow.
The problem is that the snow is sticky so it needs a number of triggers for the landslide, and the landslide of a number of snow can trigger other snow.
Sometimes the first trigger event is the sun that melts the snow, sometimes due to a lot of snow, sometimes due to natural events that are usually caused by humans.
A tornado is a rotating blob from a very low pressure air, which sucks the air around it in and upwards.
The tornado produces high-speed winds (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift heavy objects into the air and carry the object as the tornado moves.

Some applications in this category can even translate text in a foreign language on street instructions or other objects in the real world when the user directs the smartphone to the object.
Translator machines have increased dramatically, and are now often giving almost true translations (rarely wrong), but still have to be careful because there is still a possibility of being wrong.
