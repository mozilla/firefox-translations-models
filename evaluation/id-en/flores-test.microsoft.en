Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widespread, but it can also provide details that fossils usually can't provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the fur of this animal is chestnut-like brown at the top with pale or carotenoid underparts.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed trunks, called rachis, but had other features — spines and barbules — researchers concluded that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers argue that although this is the tail of a dinosaur cub, the sample shows the feathers of an adult bird, not the feathers of chicks.

He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused at Edinburgh Sheriff's Court of murdering her own son.
He is being held awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because his photo has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudiced.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous path if publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the arraignment.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to a border dispute, which Palestinians wanted based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported included the future of Jerusalem sanctified by both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the deal was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by guards as trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Parks and Heritage Conservation Acting Director at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had received thorough training and safety instruction.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission gave recommendations for the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of calculations to move the country towards new elections.
The probe was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the cancellation of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
There were 60 reported cases of malfunctions of iPods characterized by devices overheating, causing six cases of fire and four minor burn victims.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of as many as 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "deeply regrettable."
An earthquake shook the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The emergency management office of Northern Marianas said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman arrested Hong Kong tourists by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead to date.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly woman who wanted to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor during his spare time.
His research shows that when given lung hormones, the fetus will mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna is the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Unique as he is. What a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is scary as I am... maybe even more... I love him and will miss him... Hopefully he will be in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll of this view, 34 per cent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In extreme opinion polls, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should not.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness status was in doubt.
She was unable to take the medication needed to manage her pain, as it was banned from the Olympic games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on Jan. 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is likely that comets are a source of water delivery to Earth alongside organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and silliness".
He speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It leverages satellite-based technology, instead of the old ground-based radar, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft's exact location with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transport will not be operated and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and ride facilities and a car park are not on the grounds.
Concerns over a lack of transport increase the likelihood that matches will be forced to be played behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published in the journal Scientific on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations. Previously this process was believed to last longer. This is due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. Among other things, it is rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be drawn into a thin wire, so that it can be twisted and weaved. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and stuck to other metals. It can also be made so thin that it is sometimes used as a hand-painted decoration in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make indicators by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acid or alkaline (alkaline) chemicals.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electrons are stripped (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir both dry powders together, then squeeze them into balls with wet clean hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Relics of exhaust systems were found in many homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public bath houses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, then you are using satellite.
Satellites in space receive a call then bounce it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It transports us to trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Medium-sized cats under it prey on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat takes to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male brothers, along with 30 females and their cubs.
Females are usually closely intertwined with each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As versatile athletes, tigers can climb (although not very expert), swim, jump long distances, and pull 5 times stronger than humans.
Tigers are still in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are a breed that can roar.
The sound of a tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion whose voice is full, but more resembles a sentence whose words are spoken with growling sounds, shouts.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. Ocelots will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller in size.
Scientists assume that ocelots follow and look for animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the traces of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision ability, and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment, then ambushing their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from their original primary population (such as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter a different environment from the one they previously occupied.
These new environments have different resources and competitors, so new populations need different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they seem to diminish more and more like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they breathe in carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time so he feared nothing but his fellow mosasaurs.
His long jaw is packed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, also accompanied by an extra row at the top of his mouth. This means that no one can escape when passing through the mouth.
We don't know for sure yet, but it's likely that his tongue was forked. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps cannibalistic all along.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex unable to match it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called rats.
Another difference is that when the poor man and the woman eat food while sitting in a chair, the rich like to enjoy the banquet together while relaxing and eating the food.
Ancient Roman food could not bring food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built one main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that god.
Citizens would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would attempt to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open-air temple grounds and a sanctuary inside that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
Most of Jewish family life took place out in the open.
Women cook in courtyards, shops used to be just open-air counters facing the street. Stone is used to build houses.
There is no large forest in the Land of Canaan, that's why the price of wood is so expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a result of murder, and while going west discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos had lived there at the time.
Although every country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is writing behind it, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down."
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days large parchment documents (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
So, the notation is most likely inserted simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
"The territory was ruled by "Vichy" France. They were the French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"The allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940. The invasion was dubbed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it is also a measure of the size of a society.
The city-states were the vanguard of the nation. Civilizational culture means the passing on of knowledge across generations, traces of culture that still remain, and natural dissemination.
Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as viable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress as the sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes. Since there is no national executive or judiciary, Congress relies on state authority, which is often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to override interstate tax and rate regulations.
The articles require unanimous agreement from all states before they can be changed, while the states do not heed the central government so their representatives are often absent.
Italy national football, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese own nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu) thus making Japan the 7th largest island in the world
"Due to the clusters / island clusters that Japan has, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's origins date back as far as the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work in its rice fields and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern seaboards and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the original looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
To this day it is still produced, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, having a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS group of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The most commonly violated and underestimated rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is mentioned that the most effective place for such a main subject is the confluence of lines separating the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this historic period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became rich and powerful) was closely monitored.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite different languages and customs.
His overarching power influenced everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty. Church monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this teaching has been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As a result of the limited response to this tactic, the Germans expected a similar response to countless submarine battles.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many countries intend to avoid the same situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage in China or each ruling family is a different dynasty.
In addition, at the interval of each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most popular of these times is the epic Three Kingdoms which takes place in the 60-year interval between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of dead struggling to sit on the highest seats in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolute to republican government, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening up opportunities for success for the most ambitious.
The same goes for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they are now based on cailaber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other depressed working-class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this earthly life. He often visited the cave that came to be known as "Hira'" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate."
his confinement, which persists through time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place was not easy to find even when one knew that this place existed. Once inside the cave, the condition is complete isolation.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful, clean sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little can be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The "Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (among which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
"The "arc up" sign looks like the letter V and the "bow down sign" is like a staple or square that has no bottom side."
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, while downward friction is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to write down your own signs, but there are musical reasons for printed bow marks, so usually they must be adhered to.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mass of market women.
In carriages, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and calling for threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, one of the mob members waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenditure of the US imperialist war in conquering the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the spending and interest on bonds floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course a basic advantage for US imperialism.
To understand the Temple, one must understand the context in which the commandment was created.
The epoch of these events is usually called the High Middle Ages of the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The peak of the Middle Ages dates from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological impulses or technological imperatives to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than simply being socially conditioned."
For example, one can say that cars are supposed to lead to the development of highways.
However, the national highway network was not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also led to a high number of road accidents, which became the beginning of the discovery of new techniques in the world of health to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a considerable element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed the individuals, and over time came the customs and culture associated with that geography, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury dates from 400 to around 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, especially as the Crusaders brought back gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europeans began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades, people began to wear buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotational planting and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agricultural self-sufficiency and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture apart from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of a number of factors.
Members of a subculture usually mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashion, temperament, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
"Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); In some cases this child neglect is caused by the parent's rejection of the severe intellectual or physical impairment of a child."
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; Some people say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like the particular animal in which they care for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the small paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too big of a challenge for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
Children are not supposed to grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for, and educate, but the reality is that it is.
We consider the Foster Care Home System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our caregiving system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Parenting is supposed to provide for any necessities that were not in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of gratification use and approach.
"For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites. "
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements, which occur in a matter of milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that we can detect if a person is lying by observing his micro-expressions correctly.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how a person who does not understand speech due to brain damage is still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret such human behavior might be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research suggests that there are two genetic variations: hidden and uncovered.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes them from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In savannas, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems such as humans to meet amino acid needs from available vegetable sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious repercussions, namely growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest vegetable sources to obtain are proteins present in leaves and legumes, but difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they have been cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors overcame the protein problem in much the same way as chimpanzees in today's savannah."
Sleep disturbance is the process of you waking up intentionally during a normal period of sleep, then falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you restart the clock while sleeping, then it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (specifically water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated as opposed to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force there is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negative traits.
Tibetan Buddhism took the foundation of Buddhism, but later expanded on it with a focus on Mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God of Yoga. Through the visualization of the various gods the energy channels were cleansed, the chakras were activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment was created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of wars and conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the downfall of states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War begins.
The war lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought in real time, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guards after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The task of the navy is to traditionally ensure that your country is able to maintain its capabilities in terms of the movement of people and goods, and at the same time, hinder the capabilities of your enemies in terms of the movement of people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII. The Americans tried to move troops and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly uses U-boats, once tried to prevent this congestion.
Had the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it would have with any other European country.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats to make it easy to get milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats usually keep an eye on herds that wander into the hills or other grazing areas. Goats tend to be used frequently by children or adults, similar to those better known by shepherds. This method of grazing is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriage tracks consist only of wooden planks in parallel, with this track horses can pull the carriage so that it is faster and pulls more weight than a slightly rougher road at the same time.
Rail bearings were introduced early on to hold the tracks in place. However, it was slowly realized that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron layer on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels on trains to break down faster.
In the end, the wooden wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767, the first rail made entirely of iron was born.
The first known transportation was on foot. With the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living friendly with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact caused in the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root cause, and we have to disable it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing because of science and technology, as well as overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles are becoming considerable problems.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken several blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
"Throughout the night about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides"."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. Copies reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists now believe that 1 group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, as computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open drug storage or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label of first aid instructions specific to the specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from a past familiarity with bedbugs, which are highly adaptable insects parasitic on humans.
Both Killer Ladybugs and Bed Bugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adulthood.
MS is a disease that affects the center of the nervous system, which is formed from the brain, spinal cord and visual nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
A couple can decide that it is for their good, or the good of their child, to raise the child.
The couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents revoke their custody so that the other spouse can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to know how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
It has accepted Aristotle's views on all problems of science, including psychology.
As interest in Greek knowledge diminished, the West found that it was uprooted from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many have noticed that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic cues, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a standalone oscillator that will continue the period of the free run cycle even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments: marking DNA inside phages with radioactive phosphorus and marking phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the pieces of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are lineage cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism lures people to natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave a small town by car to go to work and run into other people whose purpose of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has detached the biosphere from one of its stable states that over the past two million years has underpinned human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complained about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do such complaints arise against the transport system, why do their services always fail? Are the transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental currently going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent ranges; Therefore, traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and can be more or less represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore space. Their flying abilities help them avoid enemies more easily and search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to the body.
This gives them wider options for small-sized places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; The Solar System including the Sun (and even other stars) moves around the Earth.
This seems to make sense, since Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, don't you think?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth. It carries 8x more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of about 9.6 kilometers.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers into the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. The river holds water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the Giza pyramids was never exceeded.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the colloquial language used by most of the people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorized that they turned into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements to the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of the atom is so small that the dot at the end of this sentence can contain several trillion atoms.
When it appeared, pencils became a great friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of pencils degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
is like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. It splits the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means atoms tend to break apart with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the plateau.
There may be more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava is easier to rise to the surface.
Satisfaction theory centers on discovering what makes people tick or that interests them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow older.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want something, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do a certain thing.
Two well-known charge theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
"In general, two behaviours can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the people" (or women). "
These managers struggle to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary action, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he or she has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to divisions between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their in-person physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to various time zones that their local management may not understand.
"The presence of a real "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams."
A "stealth team" is a management team where each member reports. Invisible teams set standards for individual members. "
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the practical objectives of the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the organization's functional departments, creativity, and ingenuity can take place.
As a result, an organization's processes working together to solve problems can give rise to new, innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, this data narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathologies supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors impact behavioral changes and some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information as well as material in compiling simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines to automate work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate disciplines, focusing on presenting solutions to real problems in life.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into several home computer applications and video game software.
Darmawisata is an important part of school. Often a teacher happily takes his students to places where buses cannot be used.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classes.
Sharing virtual field trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is reshaped, but the old version is kept online to make a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students usually start to experience blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers have begun working on improving the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs also "force students to be more literate about the world around them." The imperative to satisfy the audience inspires students to be astute and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage learners to extend learning beyond regular schooling.
"The use of appropriate blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of these things and various other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider essentially Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very rarely occupied, and some are even barely habitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and smallest continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and grew in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, it borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring then it will be very helpful (don't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon for it to be followed by a grip on her arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for opinions (cultural differences or not don't mean they can be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city into Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaw, but all this is reserved for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is quite safe, any visit outside Goma should be examined to understand the continuing state of fighting in North Kivu Province.
The town is also home to the Nyiragongo volcano climbing base as well as some of the cheapest trips to find Mountain Gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (ojek) to get around Goma. Normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
"With regard to its relatively difficult place to access, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation for making it a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of threatened world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
The site is one of the main stops on the PBS special, Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (TNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered a mainstay of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, it enforces daily entrance and conservation fees.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to a select few parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline similar to a glittering bar chart is further accentuated by its reflection on Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is overcrowded on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is a place that the British colonists seized as their own and if you're looking for evidence of colonial territories in the past, here is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest part of the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp - it also includes some trees that still stand in the large forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang departs between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Interdistrict buses are generally full, so it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the district is served by small Japanese Coaster Buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters long. Construction was completed in August 2011, only opened for passage in March 2017.
The bridge is set to become fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are planned to be completed.
The Guaranã were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with indigenous indigenous groups."
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Ca±�itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is set to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the archipelago located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere throughout the island, in the city of Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owner first to make sure which payment method they accept.
Exchanging Falklands currency outside the island is almost impossible, so exchange it before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be very cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the numbers on the thermometer.
"There is no "rainy" or "dry" season: because the amount of rain that falls is almost always the same for an entire year."
While most of the park's animals are used to encountering humans, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from other wild animals.
No matter how docile it may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and have potential danger, so it's best to keep your distance.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S. and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, peaceful meetings in the city culminated in the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position which includes two harbours. The most popular are in three regions.
The North Shore coast (within the North Harbour district) is located in the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming spots, and most have shade obtained from rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-filled beaches with nice shops lining the waterfront. It is safe to swim here.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's fun and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta"."
There are plenty of French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is something foreign. Black coffee alone is 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high content of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate met Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many tours to the reef take place throughout the year, and accidents on the reef due to these things are very rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to security warnings.
Box jellyfish appeared near the shore and near the mouths of rivers from October to April over 1770. These jellyfish can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their main habitat is at the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through travel agents.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also maintain the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent in advance and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you need to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stage is over, there are parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the icing is overwhelming, especially for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check requirements).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, beverage, and entertainment offerings, to keep the mood of the guests, and maintain them on site.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs clarity of mind, and all accomplished gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone going to drive at high latitudes or across mountainous regions needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On slippery and snowy highways, friction is low and you can't drive like on regular asphalt.
During a snowstorm, you can be trapped by rapidly collapsing snow.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the most attractive tourist attraction in Africa and is the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to road trips to see Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in savannas.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars, hence standard equipment already allows for good observations.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes don't want to appear and will be better seen with binoculars.
"Safari walking (also known as "bush walking", "safari climbing", or going "walking") involves climbing, either over several hours or several days."
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several sporting events will be held in a number of other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the summer Olympics twice, after the first in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but until the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help him dry quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even when not available in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can lead to shrinkage, or in extreme cases, charring).
There are a wide variety of ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, cooking water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in other areas it takes a few minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their hometown.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, result in allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit disease.
Self-infectious, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, usually do not fall into the category of pests.
Shopping at duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase goods that are duty and excise free in a number of locations.
Travelers traveling to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote hinterland.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are plenty of steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The speed limits are lower than the previous and subsequent sections – generally 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and it is important to adhere to them strictly rather than the other way around.
Although, oddly enough, mobile phone service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked into cookies all year round, with cherries and plums present in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a tiny but rich cake, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region you're in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid."
In the hinterlands of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and a number of other coasts in the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, while Indonesian food is an umbrella term that represents the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spiced dishes. The main spices that Javanese flavors love are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrup is a support for the driver's legs that hangs on any side of the saddle.
That provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially raises safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs. To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are in place.
First, most drivers wear driving boots with smooth, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially the English saddle, have safety bars that allow the skin of the stirrup to fall out of the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.
Nicknamed the Yosemite of South America, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cocham Valley, has cliffs and giant granite rock walls.
The highest part offers stunning views from the summit. Hikers from all corners of the world continue to create new routes among its limitless wall potential.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding on snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
"Skiing is becoming a major travel activity that has a lot of enthusiasts who are sometimes called 'ski bums', people who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to about the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
