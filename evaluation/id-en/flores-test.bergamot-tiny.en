The other race, the Giant Slalom, made it finish in the tenth order in the women's sitting group with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes later than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished in the first order and 1:09.02 minutes later than GyÃ¶ngyi Dani of Hungary who finished ninth. 
Four skiers in the women's seated group failed to complete their turn, whereas 45 of the total 117 skiers at Giant Slalom failed to reach the rankings in this race.
Madhya Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K Arya said, "We have detained five people who raped Swiss women and took the woman's mobile phone and laptop from them".
The accused is named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.

Although there were three people in the house who were hit by a car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious injury to the head.
The road that was the crash site was temporarily closed and the emergency service removed the driver from the red Audi T.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addendrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya in the Edinburgh Sherrif Court has been accused of killing her own son.
He was detained waiting for the indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be polluted as his photo has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judicial system works differently and the courts view the publication of the photo potentially presumptu for prejudice.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted" the journalist appears to be walking in a dangerous path if it publishes a photo of the suspect, etc. "
The Crown Office, which is in its entirety responsible for the prosecution, has indicated journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians wanted based on the border before the 1967 Middle East War.

According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Garden and Heritage Conservation Director at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new Board of Elections (CEP) which consisted of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years. 
Last month a presidential commission gave a recommendation for the previous CEP resignation as part of a calculation package to move the country towards a new election.
The examination was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
Protests that sometimes become chaotic are triggered by the cancellation of elections that should have been held since 2011.
Reportedly 60 cases of iPods malfunctions are characterized by overheating devices, causing six cases of fires and four minor burn victims.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had known as 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of the 34 additional incidents of heat, the company called "not serious."
"The ministry responded by calling the delay of the Apple report "highly regrettable"."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (21.19 GMT Friday).

The former Philippine police captured Hong Kong tourists by hijacking buses in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead to date.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have been Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old woman who wanted to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medical.
She was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
As she worked in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during her free time.
His research shows that when given the lung hormones the fetus will mature more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
The sceptlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, “Luna is the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Unique as he is. A strong woman.”
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is scary like me... maybe even more... I love him and will miss him... I hope he is now in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia being a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that he believed Australia should be a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's rule.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarchy.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not be a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness status was in doubt.

Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Some people verified the invention using a variety of hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is likely that the comet is a source of water delivery to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, since the comets collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors a "political chat and silliness"."
He speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly on a shorter route, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
This tool utilizes satellite-based technology, instead of old radar-based technology on the ground, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to find the right location of the aircraft with better precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transportation will not be operated and the diesel train will not stop at Wembley. Parking and a ride facilities as well as car parks are not in the field.
Fears of lack of transport increase the likelihood that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without a supporter.
A study published in the Scientific journal on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian GalÃ¡pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in two generations only. Previously this process is believed to last longer. This is due to the establishment of Darwin's finch breeding, Geospiza fortes, and immigrant finch cactus, Geospina conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. Among other things, it is rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be pulled into a thin wire, so it can be twisted and woven. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and sticks on other metals. It can also be made thin so that it is sometimes used as a hand painting decoration in a book called "light-lit manuscripts". 
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acid or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electrons are stripped (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dried powder into one, then squeeze into balls with clean hands wet.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The city of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a flush toilet in almost every home, which is connected to a state-of-the-art sewage system.
Relics of the dump system were found in many homes in the cities of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes merge with public bathhouses, where men and women use them together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, then you use satellites.
The satellite in space received a call and then bounced it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and outlook. 
It takes a giant rocket that is more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheels have changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing that wheels have done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It ushers us on trains, cars, and many other means of transportation. 
Medium-size cats that are under it prey on medium-sized animals, for example rabbits, antelope and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is a niche concept, a special job that every cat is carried out to keep them from competing with other cats.
The lions are the most social cat, living in a large group called prides.
Prides consists of one to three adult males of siblings, along with 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually closely intertwined with each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion's prdes act like a herd of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly for their prey.
As an all-round athlete, tigers can climb (although not very expert), swim, jump over long distances, and pull 5 times stronger than humans.
Tigers are still one group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguar. These four cats are the types that can roar.
The sound of tiger auman is not like the roar of a lion whose voice is full, but more like a sentence whose words are spoken with the sound of indignant, shouting.
Ocelot likes to eat small animals. Ocelot will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that ocelot hunted are much smaller in size.
Scientists think that ocelot follows and searches for animals to be eaten (prey) through olfactory, sniffing traces of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the darkness with the ability of night vision, and also move very quietly. Ocelot hunts its prey by blending with the surrounding environment, then ambushing its prey.
When a small group of living things (small populations) separate from their main populations of origin (such as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily return), they will often encounter different environments than they previously occupied. 
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so new populations need different features or adaptations to be able to become stronger competitors than they needed before.
Its original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they seem to be dwindling like other populations.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations would appear very different until they couldn't be called the same species.
We call it the process of species, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they inhale the carbon dioxide that humans secret (which means, breathing).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make the house from the plants and make clothes from the plants. Most of the food we eat is a plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus is a top predator in his time so he is not afraid of anything but fellow mosasaurus.
Its long jaw is packed with more than 70 teeth as sharp as a razor blade, also accompanied by an extra row at the top of its mouth. This means that no one can escape when passing through the mouth.
We don't know for sure yet, but it's likely that her tongue is branching out. The food includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurus, and maybe also during this time he cannibal.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water, including giant dinosaurs such as T. rex is not able to match it. 
Although most of their food is no stranger to us, the Romans did have a share in strange or unusual party foods, including wild boar, peacocks, circumbers, and a type of rodent called rats.
Another difference is that when the poor and the woman eat food while sitting in a chair, the rich like to enjoy the banquet together while relaxing and eating the food.
Ancient Roman food could not bring food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they don't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkeys.
The Babylonians built one main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Citizens will bring sacrifices to gods and priests will try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple ground and a sanctuary in it that only the priest can enter.
Sometimes a special tower is built in the form of a pyramid, called ziggurat, as part of the temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, homes are not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place in the open.
Women cook in the yard, the shops used to be just open-ended counters overlooking the streets. Stones are used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the Land of Canaan, that's why the price of wood is very expensive.
Greenland is inflighted. In the Norse Saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland from the murder, and when he went west found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribe had lived there at the time.
Although every country is 'Scandinavia', there are many differences between people, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen a National Treasure movie, you might think a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence. 
However, that's not true. Although there was a writing behind him, this document was not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "The Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". Text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse.”
While no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that in the beginning of a large candy document (sized 29Â3⁄4 inch by 24Â1⁄2 inch) was rolled in order to be stored. 
So, the notation is most likely inserted as just a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles have liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part is still not free.
"The region was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.”
"Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940. This invasion is nicknamed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks the American and French troops of the Merdeka had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilist, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning cities or cities, and it is also a benchmark for the size of a society.
City countries are the pioneers of the nation. The culture of civilization means the forwarding of knowledge in generations, traces of culture that still remains, and reasonable dissemination.
Minority culture usually vanishes without abandoning relevant historical evidence and fails to be recognized as a viable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government â with Congress as the only component â€" under the Confederate Articles. 
Congress has no power to tax. Since there are no national executives or judiciary, Congress relies on state authorities, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all of its actions.
It also has no authority to rule out tax regulations and tariffs between states. 
The articles require unanimous ballot deals from all states before they can be changed, whereas states do not heed the central government so their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football, also the German national football team is the most successful team in second place in the world and is the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006. 
Popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, budget, rugby, bike racing, ice hockey, hockey, and F1 motorcycle race.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international matches and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
"Because of the clusters/snorths of the island that Japan has, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as "island"
The beginning of Taiwan began a long time since the 15th century, European sailors who passed by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in the practice of local grain production and employed Chinese labourers to work in its rice fields and sugar cane plantations. 
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province belonging to the Qing Empire in 1885. 
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Agreement, which handed over its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945. 
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists have a better picture of what the original looks like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continued to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which is the dominant film size when the end of the analog film era.
To this day it is still being produced, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The format of 35 mm is actually, somewhat confusing, has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) therefore it is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format groups) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third rule that is most often violated and underrated is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining regularity in an image.
It is mentioned that the most effective place for the main subject is the meeting of the lines that separate the image into a third vertically and horizontally (see example).
During the historic period in Europe, the Catholic Church (who became rich and powerful) was closely watched.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite different languages and customs. 
His comprehensive strength affected everything from king to the common people.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth must be used to overcome suffering and poverty. The church monetary fund is available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has made many people question whether this teaching has been fulfilled.
Soon after the animosity broke out, the British began the German naval blockade.
The strategy proved effective, severing important military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law that was codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British installed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As a result of the limited response to this tactic, Germany suspected a similar response to the infinity battle of submarines.
In the 1920's, the attitude that prevailed in most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation. 
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, many countries intend to avoid the same situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job in Edison Company in New York City. 
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents on his behalf, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of decommissing different time periods; each stage in China or every ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, in the interval of every dynasty there is an unstable period of divided provinces. The most popular in this time is the Three Kingdoms epic that took place in the 60-year interval between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war took place among the nobles for the sake of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an. 
There are many social and political impacts such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolute government to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, job openings were opened for all male applicants, opening up opportunities for success for those most ambitious.
The same goes for the military because instead of the ranks of soldiers based on classes, they are now based on caillaber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class citizens who were pressured from other countries to start their own revolution.
“Muhammad is very interested in things outside of this worldly life. He often visited a cave that came to be known as "Hira'" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for tafakur."
He confined himself, which survived through time, gave a very life-lived picture of Muhammad’s spiritual tendencies. 
Located at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the whole world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows that this place exists. Once inside the cave, the condition is total isolation.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful and clean sky above and the mountains around it. There is very little to see or be heard from this cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still stand to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid was one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Giz Necropolis" in the Egyptian Dead Valley has several pyramids (among them the great pyramids are the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the majestic Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wife and family members of Khufu.
"The "blow-rising" sign looks like the letter V and "down arc sign" like a staples or square that doesn't have the bottom side."
Up means you have to start from the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start on the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward friction usually produces a softer sound, while the downward friction is stronger and firmer.
Don’t hesitate to write down your own marks, but there’s a reason for the music to be printed arc, so usually the sign has to be obeyed.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Mariae Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789 was forced back to Paris from Versailles by the mass of market women. 
With the carriages, they travel back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and calling for threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and the Queen to open their chariot windows wide.
At one point, one of the mobs raised the head of the royal body that was killed in Versailles in front of the fearful Queen.
Expenditure spending on the US imperialist war in conquering the Philippines is paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance most of the spending and interest on the floating bond on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Abundant gains obtained from prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippines are of course a basic advantage for US imperialism.
To understand the sense, one must understand the context that drives the creation of the command.
The time of the events is usually called the High Middle Ages of the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th (1000â€"1300 AD).
The peak of the Middle Ages began from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 based on convention.
Technology is a term whose practice includes a wide range of ideas, from technological impulses or technological imperatives to the strictest sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific law as well as technological manifestations. 
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that extends largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" in society, rather than simply socially conditioned."
For example, one can say that a car is supposed to lead to the development of highways.
However, the national highway network is not economically viable for a handful of cars alone, so a new production method was developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of mass cars led to the high number of accidents on the streets, which became the beginning of the discovery of new techniques in the world of health to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a considerable element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, as well as over time comes customs and cultures related to geography, and this, in harmony with the place of society, is better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was once considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
Its fame as a center of luxury dates from 400 to around the year 1100.
His status suffered a setback in the twelfth century, especially as the Crusaders again brought gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at that time that the title of the Capital of Mode was moved from Constantinople to Paris. 
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10-11th century and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the force in the west could be lagging 25 to 30 years.
Ahead of the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the biggest developments of the time was a result of the Crusades, people began to wear buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistent agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, and uses seeds stored from the ecoregion, which is combined with rotating plantings and other relatively simple techniques to maximize crop yields.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in agricultural self-sufficiency and this is still happening in many developing countries.
The subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by the standards of society and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that determines a subculture is different from others can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual, geography, or a combination of a number of factors.
Subculture members usually mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashion, temperament, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some of the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
"Such children are called "ferrals" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child’s neglect is caused by a parent’s rejection of the intellectual or physical disorder of a child.”
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some people say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised completely by a nonhuman animal, a wild child exhibits behavior (within physical bounds) almost entirely like a certain animal that takes care of it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
When project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes further.
Scapping is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the character of a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too big a challenge to be solved by students themselves.
Children are placed in the Festive Place for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children are not supposed to grow up in an environment that is not caring, caring for, and educating, but the reality is like that.
We consider the Parenting Home System to be a safe zone for these children.
Our parenting system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregiver, stable education, and reliable health care.
The carelessness should provide any necessities that were not in the house where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and gratification approach.
"For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as an important motivation in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement" and "sustainable relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eightmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites. "
The use of video recorders leads to the discovery of important interpretation of microexpression, facial movements, which occur in milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that we can detect whether a person is lying by observing his microexpression properly.
In his paper titled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how a person who does not understand the speech due to suffering from brain damage is still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret human behavior as such may be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there were two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, whereas selection removes them from the expression variation group.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation of alternating between two pools with each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems such as humans to meet the needs of amino acids from plant-based sources available.
In addition, failure in doing so has a serious impact, namely growth depression, malnutrangization, and ultimately death.
The most easily obtained vegetable sources are proteins that are in the leaves and nuts, but are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless it has been cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (antches, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein that contain all the essential amino acids. 
“Taking into account all things, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors overcame the “protein problem” in a way that is almost similar to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.”
Sleep disorders are the process you wake up intentionally during normal sleep periods, then fall asleep a short time later (10€"60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you realize without waking up completely.
If you restart the clock while sleeping, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand and turn it off. 
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing people to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates the opposite of the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way is our own tension and negative nature.
Tibetan Buddhism uses the foundation of Buddhism, but then expands them with the focus of the mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a way of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini (enlightenment energy) is resurrected through yoga posture, breathing exercises, spells, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga God. Through the visualization of various gods the energy channels were cleared, the chakras were activated, and created awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of war and conflict systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the fall of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War begins.
The war lasted until the next 40 years and would be fought for in real terms, by prosecure forces, on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and rearrange along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsoleted overnight, when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian gardaís after attacking the eastern region of Poland that violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact of the Soviet-Polishmand, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral. 
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods with large quantities across the ocean.
The task of the navy is to traditionally ensure that your country is able to maintain its capabilities in terms of the movement of people and goods, and at the same time, blocking your enemy's ability in terms of the movement of its people and goods.
One of the most important and most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used U-boats, had tried to prevent this bottleneck.
If the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as was with other European countries.
The goats appeared to be domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to nurture goats in order to easily get milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Pettre goats usually watch over herds roaming the hills or other grazing areas. Goats tend to be often used by children or adults, similar to those better known by shepherds. This method of shepherling is still used today.
Wagonways was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the train lines consist only of wooden boards in parallel, with these tracks the horse can pull the train so that it is faster and pulls more load than the slightly rougher roads at the same time. 
Rail bearings were introduced from the beginning to hold the track in place. However, it is slowly realized that the track will be more efficient if it has an iron layer on the top.
This is becoming a common practice, but iron causes the wooden wheels on the train to be damaged faster.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by an iron wheel. In 1767, the first rail was born entirely made of iron.
The first known transport was on foot. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man) two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization was found in the fossil Australopithcus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs since seven million years ago.
We can start living friendly with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact caused in the future.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to disable it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing because science and technology, as well as the excess population and human wasteful lifestyle are a considerable problem. 
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, handwritten drafts signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were brought several blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
"All night around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides"."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on the Independence Hall page on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflet that is known to still exist is the oldest copy that still exists from the document. The original handwriting copy is no longer there.
Many paleontologists now believe that 1 group of dinosaurs survived and was still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, as computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, so it cannot be immediately made a diagnosis. 
The best indications of internal poisoning may be seen from the presence of open drug storage or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instruction label specific to a specific to the poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
The term is derived from past familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adaptable as parasites in humans.
Either the Killer and Fleas Peck is a nidocolous animal, adapting to live in a nest or her host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the center of the nervous system, which is formed from the brain, spinal nerves and vision nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
Couples can decide that for their good, or the kindness of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents deprived their custody so that the other couple could nurture the child.
The main goal of science is to know how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research. 
It is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and are specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view has been accepted into all science issues, including psychology.
As the less and less interest in Greek knowledge, the West found that they were slashed from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many pay attention to rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only in the form of a response to external periodic cues, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will resume a period of free walking cycles even when external cues are not present.
Hershey and Chase experiments are one of the main proposals that states that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments: marking the DNA inside the phang with radioactive phosphorus and marking phangal proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effect of the mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ genealogy cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism lures people to the natural area to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting the park, as well as learning information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplace and cross paths with others whose purpose they have just left behind.
In the shuttle which is this dynamic transport everyone is connected with, and supports, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states that over the past two million years have supported human evolution. 
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complained about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why does such a complaint arise against the transport system, why do their services always fail? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more basic that is currently happening?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty rate.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonable range of consistent; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a reasonable consistency and more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationship between the three main characteristics: (1) grooves, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in terms of planning, designing, and operating highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore the sky. Its flying ability helps them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to the body.
This gives them a wider choice for small-sized places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insect that cannot fold its wings is dragonpe and dragonbear dragonbear.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristrachus said that the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the Solar System includes the Sun (and even other stars) moving around the Earth.
This seems plausible, because the Earth doesn’t feel like it’s moving, doesn’t it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first-largest river on Earth. The river carries 8x more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the most widespread river in the world, with a width of about 9.6 kilometers.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from various rivers to the oceans on the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). The river holds water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramid with the stone continued to the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and engineering perfection of the construction of the Giza pyramid was never exceeded.
The ancient Egyptian New Kingdom admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times because all of this can be found in nature in its original form and is relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more than four elements, namely soil, water, air, and fire.
It's more like four properties of matter (in the same order): solids, liquids, gases, and plasma, although he also theorizes that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, mixed metals are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloy metals that contain a small number of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The atomic size is unusually small so the dot at the end point of this sentence can contain several trillion atoms.
At the time of its appearance, pencils became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, along with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and use of degraded pencils. 
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never having to use sharpeners.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer appears.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart to the top of the hill. Splitting the nucleus again then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means atoms tend to break with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called a crust.
Thickness of its crust is about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the furthest side.
It's thinner under maria and thicker under the highlands.
There is likely to be more dark areas on the side close because the crust is thinner. Lavah is easier to rise to the surface.
The theory of satisfaction centers on finding what makes people moved or that interests them.
These theories show that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people who make them want something, and factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are the Maslow Needs Hierarchy Theory and Hertzberg Two Factors Theory.
“In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former counterparts. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the people" (or women). "
Managers like this have difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, setting responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to divisions between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as contact points for their direct physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their team may meet according to various time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of the real "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team. "
The "stealth team" is the management team where each member reports. Unseen teams set standards for each member. "
Why do organizations want to go through a time-consuming process in establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of the practice of the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the organization’s functional departments, creativity, and ingenuity can take place.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to address a problem can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as sharing the science and learning of the organization.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. Therefore, this data narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behaviors supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors have an impact on changes in behavior and some mental functions.
The advent of the new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information as well as materials in composing simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines to automate jobs that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the introduction of handwriting, voice and face.
Things like this are already a separate discipline, which focuses on presenting solutions to real problems in life.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has built on some home computer applications and video game software.
Darmawisata is an important part of the school. Often a teacher is happy to take his students to a place that can not use the bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tourism. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire the beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual course is also a great way to reflect on travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is changed in shape, but the old version is kept online to be used as a paste book.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Meanwhile, students usually begin to experience creating a blog with poor grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience in general changes that.
Because students are usually the most critical audience, blog writers are starting to try to improve the quality of writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to be more literate about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to be astute and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage learners to expand learning more than ordinary schools.
“Proper use of blogs” can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to internet materials, learners can define their position in the context of other writings and also make an outline of their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is a charming Canadian capital, using two languages, and features a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada past and present.
Far south is Niagara Falls and in the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of these things and various other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
The area of the north is very rarely occupied and some are even wild forests that are almost inoccutain.

Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend opinions (cultural differences or not, do not mean that it can be left!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Rome, and Merenid as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Barnca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city to be Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.

The city is also the base of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest trips to look for the trail of Mountain Gorillas in Africa. 
You can use boda-boda (ojek) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Kongo Francs for short trips. 
"With regard to its relatively difficult place to access, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant country."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation for making it a tourist attraction, and owns an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was put on a list of world-decked heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand. 
This site is one of the main stops at the special event of PBS, the Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
