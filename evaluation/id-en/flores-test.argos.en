Traffic Flow is a study on the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two dots and interactions they created each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult to do because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with a percentage of hundreds.
Fortunately, the driver tends to behave in a consistent range reasonably; therefore, the traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and more can be represented in mathematical.
To represent traffic flow better, it has been set of links between three main characteristics: (1) groove, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in terms of planning, designing, and operation of highway facilities.
