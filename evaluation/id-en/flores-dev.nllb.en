Karidno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who teaches under Modern Education and Kejayaan Raja who claims to have over 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his record, he used words that some parents considered rude, and he was reportedly using dirty words in class.
Modern Education has allegedly printed large ads on many buses without permission and lied about it by saying that he was the head tutor of English.
Dia had previously been accused of copyright infringement, but was not prosecuted.
A former student said that she "used Gaul in class, taught dating in notebooks, and behaved like a student-teacher buddy".
Over the past three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reform was carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, the size of China's economy has grown 90 times.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP could surpass the United States in two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is located about 4,800 kilometers from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind speed of 64 km/h (40 mph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center estimate that Danielle will strengthen into a storm on Wednesday.
The storm is far from the mainland, making it difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek gained popularity when he played for Partizan Belgrade.
Diaid joined them in 1945, and lasted until 1958.

"I'm glad I didn't experience anything, but I saw a terrible incident as people tried to break the window to get out".
People beat the window glass with a chair, but the candle cannot break.
"One panel eventually broke down, and they started to come out through the window", said Franciszek Kowal.
Stars give light and heat, causing the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge (or fuse) to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
Jaridum steel floats above the surface of the water due to surface tension.
Surface pressure occurs because water molecules on the surface attract each other more strongly than air molecules on top.
Molecules of air create a layer of invisible matter on the surface of water that allows objects such as jars to float above the water.
The bilah on modern ice skating has double sides with an empty basin between them, allowing for better grip on the ice, even when dimiring.
Because the side of the eye is slightly bent, when the eye is tilted to one side or the other, the edge adjacent to the eye is also bent.
If the skater board is tilting to the right, the skater is tilting to the right, if the skater board is tilting to the left, the skater is tilting to the left.
To return to their previous energy levels, these atoms must dispose of the excess energy they get from light.
"They do this by emitting a small particle of light commonly called a photon".
"Scientists call this process "restimulation of radiation emission" because atoms stimulate bright light, which causes the emission of photons of light, and light is one type of radiation".
The next image shows an atomid emitting a photon, which in the real world is actually much smaller than the one in the picture.
A photon is even smaller than a half-atomic compound.
After operating for hundreds of hours, the bohlam filaments eventually burned and the bohlam stopped working.
Please be careful when replacing the bulb.
First, the switch for the light fittings must be switched off or the cable removed.
This is caused by an electric current flowing into the socket where the metal part of the bolt is located, which can cause fatal electrical shock when you touch the inside of the socket or the base of the bolt when some of them are still stuck in the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood flows from the heart into a canal called the artery and back into the heart through a canal called the vein.
Triceratops have teeth that not only can smooth leaves, but also very large branches or roots.
Some scientists believe that the Triceratopid feeds on the palm mouse, a type of plant common in the Kapur period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of leafy, spiky leaves.
Seekor Triceratops can use its powerful parrots to cut off leaves before eating the berries.
Other scientists say that these plants are so poisonous that it seems that no dinosaurs ate them, although now sloth bears and other animals such as the nuri (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would be lighter than when you were on Earth.
A person weighing 90 kg on Earth would weigh 16 kg on Io, which is why gravity has a lower attraction.
The sun does not have a crust like the Earth that you can walk around.The entire solar system is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
Gas becomes thinner as you move further away from the center of the Sun.
The outer layer we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had a phase, as did the moon.
The phase occurs because only the side of Venus (or from the side of the Moon) facing the Sun gets light.The Venus phase supports the Copernican theory that planets orbit the Sun.
Furthermore, a few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus.
Britain had gone through a long period of peace after the Daneid conquest.
However, in 991 Ethelred was confronted with a Viking fleet larger than the Mana Pun fleet since the Guthrum fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian man with ambitions to reclaim his country from the power of Denmark.
After the military defeat, Ethelred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed results.
Hangeul is the only alphabet that was deliberately invented for everyday use, and was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 - 1450).
King Sejongid was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most revered.
"Awalnya was named after the alphabet Hangeul as Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "a sound that is true to the instruction of the people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came to be, one of which is about the migration of the Aryan people from the west to India, who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and a comparison with Latin used in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit.After the compilation of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit language changed as a result of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is the source of a wide variety of modern Indian languages, as well as Latin, which is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
With the Battle of France over, the Germans began preparing to invade the British Isles.
"Germany dubbed their attack 'Operation Singa Lautid' and most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British Army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so their army was quite weak".
"However, the Royal Navy is still far more powerful than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy the invasion fleet sent across the English Channel".
However, very few British Navy ships have marched near a possible invasion route because sailors fear their ships will sink due to German airstrikes.
Mariid began by explaining the Italian plan, which was essentially a "brother-in-law" of Germany and Japan.
It has a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy's main targets are African countries, and to take them, they need to have a launch pad for troops to sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To do so, they had to get rid of the British base and ships in Egypt.
Japan is now a landlocked country, just like Britain.
A submarine is a ship designed to travel deep in the sea, and remain in situ for a long time.
Submarines were used in both World War I and World War II, when the ships were very slow and had very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly travelled by sea, but this was followed by the development of radar and the increasing accuracy of submarines penetrating the seabed to keep them invisible.
German submarines are called U-boats, and the Germans are experts in navigating and operating submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war it was unlikely that Germany would have many submarines.
"Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "King Anak Laki-Laki", was one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times".
What is interesting is that they were not considered important in ancient times, and were not recorded in most ancient king lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous, and while many of the former tombs were looted, this tomb did not continue.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the red wheel made the Assyrian chariot lighter, faster, and more ready to ride the army and other chariots.
The arrow of a mortar's bow can penetrate the head of an enemy army.About 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry was a cavalry force fighting on horseback, and the pelana had not yet been discovered until the Assyrian cavalry was fighting on the back of a horse without wings.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists, and perhaps the most famous of these is Homer, the legendary blind poet who compiled two works of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remained popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
The Greek mathematician Pythagoras, also famous for his theory of the relationship between the sides of a triangle, was popular.
There are various estimates of how many people speak Hindi, which is estimated to be the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether the related dialects are well-counted or not.
It is estimated that between 340 million and 500 million speakers, or 800 million people, can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar but often different vocabulary; in everyday conversation, the speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, the northern region of Estonia was strongly influenced by German culture.
Some German rabbis wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they created the literary language of Estonia.
"This language is based on the German alphabet and one pun character is added".
As time passed, many words borrowed from the German people were lost.
Traditionally, the pewaris takhta would immediately enter the military after finishing school.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, obtaining a 2:2 (lower second-class degree).

The European Turks (east Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) comprise 3% of the country.
The Turkish territory has a length of more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 kilometres (500 miles), with a shape of roughly a perpendicular.
The Turkish territory, including the lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), the bulk of the area is 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) in southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
The Turkish territory makes it the 37th largest country, and is about the size of the French Metropolitan City and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by three seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it has been independent since 1839.
Yangid is now part of Belgium, formerly part of Luxembourg but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but the country was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of the organization later known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzongid is a ruined Buddhist fortress and monastery in the upper part of Paro District (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built a fort to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire caused the remains of Drukgyal Dzong to be destroyed, leaving only a few remains, for example the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
Following the fire, the fort was preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational tourist attractions.
During the 18th Century Cambodia was caught between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, Vietnamese invaded Cambodia as well.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, while most of the remaining workers work in the informal economy.
Of the two-thirds of Venezuelans working in the service sector, nearly one-quarter work in industry and one-fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, the country's export commodity, although only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.

The Serengeti Region is made up of the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Maasai Mara National Cagar Alam in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classrooms (making storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to reevaluate your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires project components to be connected to each other, but also makes sense as separate entities.
The disadvantage of the magnifying glass lies in the focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to achieve a focal length range much larger than the main lens.
This becomes less of a problem as lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allows magnifying lenses to produce images of the same quality as those produced by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually slower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap lenses in low light conditions without using flashlights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is overscan.
Most television is designed to entertain the general public.
That is why everything seen on TV has boundaries on the upper, lower, and lower sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, the tape may be cut off, and if there is too much text down, then the text will be cut off as well.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, reflecting the shadow of the cavalry with the tombak, the banquet, and the Arthurian ksatria.
Even as you stand amid thousands of years old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sound and aroma of battle in the Muslim world, so much so that you can almost hear the sound of horses trekking through rocky roads and smell the scent of terror emanating from the underground prison pit.
But is our imagination based on reality? First of all, what is the purpose of the castle? how were the castles designed and built?
As a distinctive feature of the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more like a brick house than a real castle.
The large windows and the thin walls will not be able to withstand the attack any longer.
In the 1480s, when construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only needed against a small group of roaming bandits.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European countries should strive to prevent one country from becoming too strong, and therefore national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish Civil War marked the first war with a central issue of balance of power.
This marked a significant change, as the European powers would no longer have any excuse for a religious war, and thus the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be marked as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BC in a scorched earth attack by Herostratus.
According to this account, the motivation was the fame of the city at the expense of all that was possible, and the Ephesians, who were dismayed, announced that Herostratus' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name, as we know it today, the temple was destroyed on the night of Alexander the Great's birth.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected.After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Make sure your hand is in the most serleksid state possible while still pressing each note correctly - Trying to do so with your fingers doesn't make much extra movement.
Remember that you don't have to press the tuts too hard to get extra volume like on a piano.
Diid accordion, to get a larger volume, you use a higher pressure or speed.
Mistiscism is the search for a kerukunan, beridentitas, or awareness of the highest reality, spiritual truth, divinity, or God.
Mukidmin sought direct experience, intuition, or insight into the reality of the divine/dewa or dewa-dewi.

The Indus Valley Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that includes most of present-day Pakistan and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Peradvantage flourished in the Indus River basin, from which it derives its name.
Although some researchers speculate that the Peradaban also formed in the now-developing Sarasvati river basin, the name Peradaban Indus-Sarasvati will be accurate, while others call it Peradaban Harappa, named after Harappa, the location of its first excavation in the 1920s.
The military qualities of the Roman Empire helped in the advancement of medical progress.
Doctors began to be recruited by Caesar Augustus and even the first Roman Medical Corps was formed to operate after the battle.
The surgeon has knowledge of a wide range of tranquilizers including morphine from poppy seed extract and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They became experts in amputation to save patients from gangrene, as well as torniket and clem artery to obstruct blood flow.
Over the course of several centuries, the Roman Empire made rapid advances in medicine and created the wealth of knowledge we know today.
Pure origami is origami with a limitation on only one folding allowed at a time, not allowing for more complicated folds such as re-folding, and each folding has a loose location.
This origami was developed by John Smith in 1970 to help inexperienced or motor-limited gamers.
Children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes from an early age, and these stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children of a known racial minority are less likely to perform well in school after learning about their racial stereotypes.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States with 54 million profiles currently.
These websites attract a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are also positive aspects of these websites, including the ability to easily set up classroom pages that can be accompanied by blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by simply providing one web address, which is easy to remember and easily dictated by students who may have trouble using typeboards or spelling.
The ID can be customized to make it easier to read and also more or less color as desired.
Attention Deficit Disorder is a neurological syndrome that classically defines three sets of symptoms, including impulsive, distracted, and hyperactive alias energy overload.
"This is not a learning disability, but a learning disability; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps about 2 million American children".
Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like schoolwork, but can concentrate on things they enjoy doing, such as playing a gym or watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without a bookmark.
"These children tend to get involved in a lot of problems, because they're "engaged in risky behavior, fighting, and challenging the authorities" to stimulate their brains, because their brains can't be stimulated in the usual way.
ADD affects a person's relationship with another age group because other children cannot understand why the person behaves in this way or why the person spells their own way or their level of maturity is different.
With the changing ability to acquire knowledge and learn as mentioned above, the rate at which the knowledge base is acquired also changes.
The focus is not on individual memory, but on the ability to remember text.
At its core, the Renaissance created a significant shift in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move or hold loads or hanging on trees.
The chimpanzee's arms and legs have similar sizes and lengths, reflecting the use of hands to hold loads while walking with a fingerbook.
The human hands are shorter than the legs, with more straight phalanges.
Fossil hand bones dating from 2 million to 3 million years ago show that this specialized hand shifted from a pendulum to a motor.
Some people believe that having many artificially induced dreams can be quite tiring.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the effect of sleep-consciousness increasing the length of time between each type of REM state.
With less REM per night, the condition occurs when you are sleeping well and when the body recovers so that it does not occur often enough to cause a problem.
It's just as frustrating as when you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream every night.
The situation was not going well for the Italians in North Africa as it was early on, and within a week of Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussars had taken over Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In the raid on the eastern Bardia, the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marsekid Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and Mussolini's heir, was killed by his own shot while landing in Tobruk.
Angidgar, a modern sport, is contested at various levels, from university students to professional competitions and the Olympics.
The sport is generally played in a duel format, with one player engaged in a duel with the other.
Golf is a game in which the player uses a punch to put the ball into the hole.
Eighteen holes are played during the regular round, for players usually start at the first hole on the field and finish at the 18th hole.
The winner is the player who makes the least stroke or fasting stick to finish the game.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the shorter dipotong holes and green dynamics.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one most people associate with traveling: leisure travel.
This is when someone goes somewhere very different from their daily routine to relax and have fun.
The beach, the park and campsites are often the most popular places for recreational tourists to visit.
If the goal of a person's visit to a place is to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is also known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit a variety of landmarks from a particular country or may choose to focus on just one area.
Seeing this activity, the Colonialists also called for ammunition.
The combined forces strengthened the frontline position including the first and third New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later to become generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the Colonis position.
As the rising air opened up the gaps along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with short stone walls northward that ended on the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark bet about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the regulars crossed.
The American Plan relies on the launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was able to launch a pengalihan attack on the British garrison at Bordentown, to block the ammunition.
General James Ewingid would lead 700 militiamen across the river at Trenton Ferry, bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy forces from escaping.
The 2,400-strong main assault force would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter-mile run to a half-mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance an absolute necessity.
A half-mile runner, who can reach half a mile in two minutes, must have a good speed but must develop endurance in all hazards.
A small cross-country run in winter, combined with gym exercises for the upper body, is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot produce elite performance, but can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding various aspects of supplementary practice can help athletes improve performance and enjoyment of exercise.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the little equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased according to their needs, but most will have little or no impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they like a product even if it does not provide any real benefits.
The atomid can be considered as one of the fundamental constituent elements of all matter.
It is a very complex entity composed, according to the simplification of the Bohr model, of electrons orbiting the center of the nucleus, similar to a planet orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two particles - a neutron and a proton.
Protons have a positive charge, whereas neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge.
To check the victim, you must first observe the scene to ensure your safety.
You need to pay attention to the position of the victim as you approach, as well as to automatic hazard signs.
If you get hurt while trying menolong, you will only make the situation worse.
The findings of the study were depression, fear, and the assumption that the disease would occur mediated by a link between pain and disability in patients with low back pain.
Only the effects of a supposed disaster, not depression and fear, are the prerequisites of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those who participate in routine activity need more support in terms of negative perception of pain that distinguishes chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system in the sensory organ or eye.
There are many different types of eye structures, ranging in size from the cervix to the needs of the organism itself.
Different types of construction have different capabilities, depending on different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness, and also require different processing in understanding different inputs and numbers in order to work optimally.
A population is a collection of organisms of a particular species within a particular geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of a particular phenotypic property, they are called monomorphic.
When someone shows some kind of certain property, they include polymorphic ones.
The colonies of Berber and Berber seeds are divided into different phases.
In the nomadic phase, the Berber army would march at night and stop to stop by during the day.
The colonies began the nomadic phase when food was scarce, during which the colonies made temporary shelters that were replaced daily.
