Stars give light and heat, because the energy created when hydrogen atoms join (or fusion) to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and will take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
Steel needles floating above the surface of the water due to surface voltage.
The surface pressure is due to water molecules on the surface that attract each other more strongly than the air molecules on it.
Water molecules create invisible layers on the surface of water that allow needlelike objects to float above water.
Modern ice slides have a double edge with an empty concave between them -- these two sides allow better grips on ice, even when tilted.
Because the side that the blade is slightly crooked, when the eye is tilted to one side or the other, then the edges that cross with the ice also bend.
This causes the skater to turn; if the skateboard is tilted to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skater is tilted to the left, the skater turns left.
To go back to the previous energy level, these atoms have to waste the excess energy they get from light.
"They do this by emitting a small particle of light commonly called "photon."
"The scientist calls this process "simulates radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes photon emissions, and light is one type of radiation."
The next picture shows an atom that emits photons. Of course, in the real world photons are much smaller than the ones in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than atomic constructors.
After operating for hundreds of hours, the bulb filaments finally caught fire and the bulbs stopped glowing.
Light bulbs need to be replaced, please be careful when changing light bulbs.
First, the switch to the lightware must be turned off or the cable will be unplugged.
This is caused by the electric current that flows into the socket where metal bulb parts are located, which can cause a fatal electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb when some of them are still stuck in the socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
The blood flows from the heart in channels called arteries and returns to the heart through channels called veins.
Triceratops have teeth that not only melt leaves but also branches or roots that are very smooth.
Some scientists think Triceratops eat sago palms, which are a common plant of the Kapur period.
These plants look like tiny, pointed, leafy palms.
A Triceratops can use its strong beak to trim the leaves before eating the stems.
Other scientists say that these plants are so toxic that no dinosaurs seem to eat them, even though sloth bears and other animals such as nuri can eat leaf or poisonous fruit.
If you stand on the surface of Io, you'll weigh lighter than when you're on Earth.
The people weighing 90 kg on Earth will weigh 16 kg in Io, which is why gravity has a lower attraction.

Gas gets thinner as you get further away from the center of the Sun.
The outside we see when we look at the Sun is called photosfer, which means "the light ball."
Some three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, as did the moon.
The phase occurs because only the Venus side (or the side of the Moon) is facing the sun gets the light. the Venus phase supports the theory of Copernicus claiming that the planet surrounds the Sun.
Some years later, in 1639, British astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus.

Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which is a source of all sorts of modern Indian languages, just like Latin for European sources like France and Spain.
With the end of the French battle, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of Britain.
"The German called their attack "Operation Sea Lion" -- most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British Army lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk, so their army was pretty weak."
"However, the Royal Navy is far more powerful than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy the invasion fleet sent across the English Channel."
However, very few British Navy ships were based near possible invasion routes because admirals feared that their ships would sink due to German air raids.
Italians are basically German and Japanese brothers.
It has a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they've just built four new ships just before the start of the war.
Italy's main targets are African countries, to take those countries, they need to have a troop launch platform, so the troops can sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To do so, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and beyond that, Italian warships were not supposed to do anything else.
Japan is a land country, just like Britain.
The submarine is a ship designed to travel underwater, and it stays there for a long time.
Submersibles were used in World War I and World War II, when ships were very slow and had very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war, they travel mostly by sea, but as radar develops and the more accurate submarines enter below the sea in order to be invisible.
German submarines are called U-boats.
Because of their success with submarines, after the German war was untrusted to have many submarines.
"Yes King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "King of the Sons", is one of the most famous ancient kings of Egypt in modern times."

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that are controlled in interactive classes ( storyboard creation, audio and video editing, storytelling etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reassess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that the project components connect to each other, but it also makes sense as separate entitys.
The lack of magnifying lenses lies in the focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to get the long range of focals much larger than the main lens.
This became less of a problem because lens manufacturers reached higher standards in lens production.
This allows the magnifying lens to produce an image of the same quality produced by the lens at fixed focus range.
Another loss of the zoom lens is the maximum opening (speed) of the lens usually slower.
This causes cheap lenses to be difficult to use in less light without the use of lightning.
One of the most common problems of trying to convert films into DVD formats is overscans.
Most televisions are made to please the public in general.
Therefore, everything seen on TV has boundaries on the top, the bottom, and the sides that are cut.
This is done to make sure the image covers the entire screen. It's called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edge may be cut off, and if the text is too down, then the text will be cut off as well.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired imagination, heralding the shadow of a joust group with spears, banquets, and Arthurian knights.
Even standing in the midst of the ruins of thousands of years old, it is easy to imagine the sounds and scents of battles of the past, almost able to hear the footsteps of a horse track down a rock road and smell the fear that comes from an underground prison pit.
But are our imaginations based on reality, first of all, what were the castles built for, how were they designed and built?
As is typical of the period, Kastel Kirby Muxloe is more like a fortified house than a real castel.

The balance of power is a system that European countries are trying to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European countries should try to prevent one country from becoming too strong, and therefore national governments often change their alliances to keep balance.
The Spanish Successor War marked the first war with the central issue of balance of strength.
This marked an important change, since European power would no longer have an excuse to become a religious war, thus the Thirty Years'War would be the last war marked as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. in the act of burning by Herodotus.

The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that covers most of Pakistan today and some areas in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilizations thrived on the Indus River basin, which is the origin of its name.
Although some researchers speculate that civilizations are also formed in the now dried valley of the Sarasvati river, the naming of the Indus-Sarasvati civilization would be appropriate, while others call it the Harappa civilization, named after Harappa, which was the first dig site in the 1920s.
The militaryistic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the progress of medical progress.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps to operate after the battle.
Surgeons have knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracting popi seeds and scopolamine from herbs seeds.

"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disorder; it's "Influenced 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe about 2 million American children."
Kids with ADD find it hard to focus on things like schoolwork, but can concentrate on things they like to do, like playing gym or watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without reading.
"These kids tend to get involved in a lot of problems, because they're "involved in risky behavior, fighting, and challenging authorities" to stimulate their brains, because their brains can't be stimulated in the usual way.
ADD affects a person's relationship with another age because other children can't understand why sufferers act that way or why sufferers spell in their own way or their own level of maturity.
With the change of ability to acquire knowledge and learn as noted above, the basic rate of knowledge has also changed.
The approach to getting the information is different, the emphasis is no longer on individual memories, but the ability to remember text.
In essence, the Renaissance created a significant change in the approach to learning and the spread of science.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move or hold weights or when hanging from trees.
The chimpanzee's hands and legs are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of hands in holding weight when walking by knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than his leg, with a more upright phalanges.
A handbone fossil between two million and three million years old shows the shift in the hand's specialization from thrust to drive.
Some believe that experiencing many artificially induced conscious dreams can often be exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is that conscious dreams add duration to each REM state.
With a little bit more REM per night, the condition of your sleep is sound and while the body is healing, it's not often enough to cause a problem.
It's as exhausting as when you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream consciously every night.

Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling: The recreation tour.
It's when someone goes to a place very different from their day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, vacation parks, and camping camps are often the most common places visited by vacation tourists.
If a person's goal in visiting a place is to know his history and culture, then this type of tourism is also known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various landmarks from certain countries or may choose only to focus on just one area.
In view of this activity, colonists also called for reinforcements.
The troops reinforced the forerunners including the first and third New Hampshire regiment of 200 men, under Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later to become generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence at the north end of the colonists position.
When the water recedes open a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast peninsula, they quickly extend the fence with a short stone wall to the north that ends at the waterbank on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark bet about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until regular through it.
The American plan is relying on coordinated attack launch from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder can launch a diversional attack on the British garrison in Bordentown, to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing will take 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main strike force number 2,400 will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter-mile run to a half-mile, the speed becomes less important and the endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
It's true that a good runner half a mile, which is able to reach half a mile in two minutes, has to have a decent speed but he has to develop endurance at all costs.
A small portion of cross country running in winter, combined with gymnasium training for the upper body, is the best preparation for the running season.
The proper nutrition practice alone cannot produce an elite performance, but it can significantly affect the health of young athletes as a whole.
Keeping healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding various aspects of supplementation practice can help athletes improve performance and sports pleasure.
Intermediate running is a relatively cheap sport; yet, there is much misunderstanding about the few tools needed to participate.
Products can be bought according to their needs, but most will have little or no impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they like a product even if it does not provide real benefits.
Atoms can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
This is a very complex entity made up, according to the simplification of the Bohr model, over the electron orbiting the center of the nucleus, similar to the planet orbiting the sun - see Picture 1.1.

The findings of the study were depression, fear, and assumption that calamity would occur mediating the relationship between pain and disability in those suffering from lower back pain.
Only the effects of the alleged disaster, not depression and fear are the terms of regular weekly PA structure sessions.
Those who participate in routine activities need more support in terms of negative perception of pain that distinguishes chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movements.
The vision, or the ability to see depends on the visual system of the sensory organ or the eye.
There are many kinds of eye construction, unfolding based on the complexity based on the needs of its own organisms.
Various constructions have different capabilities, depending on different wavelengths and different degrees of sharpness, also require different processing in terms of different inputs and numbers in order to work optimally.

"However, if this happens, it may not be for a very long time, the stars are so scattered that the distance between the stars that are "neighbored" is a trillion kilometers."
Perhaps one day, your great-great-grandchildren will stand in an alien world trying to imagine what their ancient ancestors were like?
Animals are made of many cells, animals eat them and digest them, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals have them; jellyfish, for example, have no brains).
Animals can be found in different parts of the Earth, animals digging up the earth, swimming in the sea, and flying in the sky.
Cells are the smallest functional and structural units of living creatures.
Cells come from cella, which in Latin means small spaces.
If you look at things with a microscope, you'll see that they're made up of rectangular clusters or small balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw a small box inside a cork with a microscope.
It was like a room, and he was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can move from one condition to another and not change.
Nitrogen as gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example: compound water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's gas, liquid matter, or solid matter.
Although the physical shape may change, the chemical shape remains the same.
Time is something around us, and it affects everything we do, even though it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We pass through time like a series of events that pass from the future to the present into the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (long) of events.
You can personally mark the passage of time, the way you look at repeat events, the repetitive event is something that happens again and again regularly.

For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it is believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted a giant bird called the moas.
The theory then began the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia with the Great Fleet and took New Zealand from Moriori, in turn forming an agricultural society.
New evidence, however, indicates that Moriori is a migrating land Maori group from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own unique and peaceful culture.
There are other tribes in the Chatham Islands, Maori who migrate from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, and then there were small battles, but in the end Moriori was destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to appreciate our strength and our spirit while honestly judging our difficulties and even failures.
As we listen to individuals share their own stories, families, and organizations, we gain valuable knowledge of the past and some personalities that affect the organization's culture either for good or for bad.
While understanding one's history does not assume understanding of culture, it at least helps people gain an understanding of their position in the history of the organization.
When assessing the success and awareness of failure, the individual and the entire person who participated in finding the value, mission, and power of the organization further.

The converging mindset is a problem solving technique that combines some ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic, and precision, as well as fact identification, reenactment of existing techniques, gathering information.
The most important factor in this mindset is: there's only one right answer -- you only think of two answers, that's right or wrong.
This type of thinking involves certain sciences or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems, and do scientific tests.
So far, humans are the most skilled species of human mind reading.
That means we're able to predict well what other humans feel, mean, believe, know or want.
Understanding other people's intentions is very important among these abilities, so that we can complete the ambiguity that may exist from physical action.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you might think he's trying to steal someone's car.
He needs to be judged differently if he loses his car keys and that's his own car he's trying to get into.
The MRI was based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (work at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields, and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnosis tool.
Four years later a patent was given, which became the world's first patent published in the field of MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "all body" MRI scanner, which he named "Indomitable."
